"I purchased this product because I wanted a safe, natural, USA made chicken jerky treat from my long hair chihuahuas.  This product appeared in the search ""chicken jerky treats made in USA"".  Both dogs loved the treat, but it is VERY crumbly and they stick together, tearing into pieces when you try to remove one from the bag.  It is NOT ""jerky like"" in any way.  My chihuahuas finished off one each in the last minute, and I have a couple of of other dogs that are doing"

My cat could not tolerate Science Diet Prescription cat food so I tried this organic food.  This food eliminated her puking.  She has never had any digestive problems with the Organix dry food and eats it without hesitation.  She eats the Organix Adult and Kitten dry cat food with a little more gusto so I mix in some of that food with this one.  I plan to keep her on the Organix dry food indefinitely. Great products! TL;DR Great cat food!! I am so grateful to be able to share my Organic Cat Food with
"They are always running out of stock.  ""They say"" it's because of a hold-up at the border.  I say - who's checking inventory?  They were out of stock in April and again in August.  I was told on August 16 that they would have coffee in their warehouse on 8/17.  Today we still have no coffee.  How can a coffee company be out of coffee?  This is a recurring problem with Tim Horton and I'm getting really sick of it.

I believe they wanted this cookie to taste like a brownie. I am so used to Chips Ahoy having that subtle choco flavor with a crisp bite that this cookie surprised me.

Unlike another reviewer, I did not find the product to be flimsy at all; they held up to the very last tasty bite.

It's a shame that the ingredients were not used for their real"
"The texture of the chocolate-covered raspberry jells is perfect, and the taste is so close to the original that I was totally satisfied. BUT: the sugar alcohols used to sweeten it are lethal to the digestive system. If you eat more than one of them in a single day, be warned. You're going to need a restroom nearby. However, if you can restrain yourself, these are a delicious treat. My only concern is the expense, so I'd recommend asking for the candies first.

"These are by far the best espresso pods available, I have tried them all. Lavazza has long been known to produce some of the best coffee in Italy. If you like the over roasted, bitter, breath stinking crap they serve at Starbucks, you will not like good espresso like Lavazza. If you appreciate real espresso that creates a strong crema and a smooth taste, these are for you. Those that have been to Italy know what I mean. TL;DR Starbucks??? Really?

"We have been buying the Earth's Best brand cereal for my son from the very beginning. Though now we use it only to mix in with the runnier jarred foods. 12 boxes will last a LONG time. I think we have gone through not quite 2 boxes in the past 3 months. We also use plain oatmeal, a flavored oatmeak, and a mixed-grain for variety. Your baby might vary but depending on when you switch to finger foods, a 12-pack will last a LONG time. We are so lucky we are making it to 5"
"Very crisp and tough, does not melt, but  breaks down into pretty large particles in your mouth.  I enjoy it as a cereal, but neither of my 11 mo old twins<br />really enjoy the tough texture.

"I came across these crackers in a local market and decided to give them a shot. I had tried several other brands of rice crackers (ka-me, sesmark, back to nature), and they all have this distinct burnt rubber after-taste to them that I just cannot swallow. Not these! Diamond's have the most pleasant taste, and are really addicting. When I found these in the market, they were half the price of the other brands I mentioned. Not sure where it got the best reviews, but I think they are worth the money."

"After trying this brand's pumpkin pie sugar free syrup, I was amped to try this one! (Especially since that certain chain of coffee places that I am addicted to took their sugar free gingerbread latte off the holiday menu 2 years back)  Anyways after making my latte and being all hyped for the first drink... I was left feel a lil like ehhhhh.  I mean it's not terrible, but it's not what I expected it to be. TL;DR: I'm not going to give up on this sugar free recipe. "
"This is the best price I have found for coconut oil.  I love using this in my cooking. It is so good for you! And you can also use it for your skin, it makes your skin soft when you rub it in, a little greasy for a few minutes, but worth it. TL;DR Best price for Coconut Oil: Coconut Oil is a great choice for any skin tone.

"Ever since I discovered this product at a small, independent pet store on the Upper West Side in New York City some years ago, my cats have been wild for it. Of course, the ones who enjoyed it then have long since passed on, but my current five are ecstatic whenever they see me take out the big round container. When I first found it in that pet store (an open container was sitting on a counter), I bought some for a dear friend who lives about 2-3 blocks from where I live. When she came home from work one day, the box had"

"This Fruit Dip Peach Passion Mix is Awsome!!! It was the hit of the get together I had with my friends a few afternoons ago. Just mix with Sour Cream, or Sour Cream and Cream Cheese and serve with fruits in season. I used Strawberries, Peach and Nectarine Slices and Rasberries. Make certain that you mix it up and let it sit in the refrigerator at least an hour prior to serving so the flavors can mingle. It is that simple.

This snack boasts one serving of fruit, a good source of vitamins C and B, and tastes almost as good as a less healthy alternative although the strawberry has almost a more grape taste than strawberry.

"Hi, my name's Kat and I'm a coffee snob. We love this coffee. It has such a smooth taste. We do not like burnt-tasting coffee. To us, Starbucks and many others claiming a ""bold"" flavor are just over-roasted until they are charred. We love a strong, smooth, mildly roasted coffee. Coffee that is just toasted, not overdone.

"First of all, I LOVE strong, smooth coffee.  I had previously enjoyed the Illy dark roast espresso, and I thought that a lighter roast might be healthier, since it is roasted with less heat/ time.  I tried this and was not disappointed.  Do I prefer it to the dark (?); I have not decided, but it is equally tasty when made on my stove top percolator.  Increasingly, I am shopping based on ethics AND value, so if anyone is willing to give me an opinion on this, please tell them.

I started buying these when they first came out and was thrilled to have a gluten free version of rice krispies at the same price as regular. Then the local stores stopped carrying them for whatever reason and I was very disappointed. It's great to find them on here and at the subscribe and save price they're more affordable than the tiny boxes of organic speciality rice krispies imitators that are still available in the local store. I don't need organic or whatever I just wanted to eat the same quality rice krispies as they were fresh.

I wasn't much of a coffee drinker before. Once in awhile I'd go to Starbucks to get an iced coffee but that was probably once a month and for awhile not having any coffee at all for a year.

"I couldn't disagree more with the previous review. No, they're not chocolate, they're soy. But they are delicious!! I find myself eating handfuls right out of the bag, but they are also great in cookies. They have a buttery, highly vanilla flavor, and a handful of them makes me think instantly of a Dairy Queen ice cream cone. If you love vanilla you should love these just as candy. TL;DR ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! They're also great for the money and are delicious for dessert!

They also have protein, and I love eating them just as a snack as well as if I'm on the go or post workout.  My only problem is they are hard to find in grocery stores...and I usually don't like to wait around to fill out a ""please stock this item"" form. TL;DR The best granola bars in town!

Wow this one whisks up really nicely! Granted I am getting better at whisking and making a nice froth on top of my matcha but this one was easy peasy! I have noticed some matcha flavors mix more easily than others for some reason and since I do make more than one matcha many days its not just due to me being better one day versus another. This one whisked up to a very full forth quite easily! I note this because I know froth is really good at the end of the day and it really did help the flavor balance out

I like this product very much but it's important to also follow the prices. I had to drop the rating down to 2 stars from 4.5 stars because of the drastic price increase.  The last time I bought it the price was $32.18.  An E-Mail advertisement arrived today at $47.55.  The price went up $15.37 which is an increase of 48%.  THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS!! TL;DR WAY TOO EXPENSIVE!!! I have to recommend this to anyone who has tried to buy from Amazon

"These Lazy Day dark chocolate ginger cookies are free of any gluten, wheat, dairy, and eggs.  You would think a cookie without these ingredients might taste like cardboard.  But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  While the cookie isn't crisp and tastes slightly stale, the flavors work well and it's a tasty treat.  The ginger is subtle.  The dark chocolate isn't of the highest quality, but still enjoyable.  If you require a cookie without these specific ingredients, you can purchase one for yourself at the store.

"My voice is my job. In the last months I felt a bit tired. My voice was a bit veiled. In some specialized Linkedin forums someone sayd this product is a sort of cure-all.

"I like spice, so I was eager to try this product.  Generally, I like basic bottled Seven Seas or Kraft Italian dressing, but the name Taco Bell intrigued me.  I tried some on salad.  First of all, the dressing is extremely thick.  I didn't like its texture.  Flavor-wise, I found the dressing far overpowered the salad, made up of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is far too heavy, both in flavor and texture, and I think I could use a few tweaks to my salad, but the salad"
"Has soy grits and flax in it, not what you expect in chips, and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing. Not the usual corn taste, although it has some health benefits.

"My sister turned me on to this tea and I have to say it makes the most delicious iced tea I have ever tasted.  I love green tea, but I don't like to add sugar and sometimes I find tea made from teabags can taste bitter.  This tea has none of the bitterness and such great flavor.  Plus, it made me feel good when I drank it.  I have only had it iced so far, but I just ordered a 6-pack of this and my sister loves the flavor.

The tea was a bit bland"
"It is hard to get my 9 month old to eat vegetables, but luckily she likes this blend! As another review mentioned, it is pretty runny but I just thicken it up with rice cereal.

For instant coffee it's pretty good.  Of course brewed coffee is richer but sometimes it's nice to be able to get a quick cup.  It's also handy for flavoring in recipes.

"Although I like olives, often I only want 3 or 4 due to their intense flavor. These olives have a great flavor that keeps you coming back for more. I love to snack on them at work and have no problem finishing the whole package each time. TL;DR Delicious! -I've found that my favorite olives are the one with the green onion"

"on our resident fat cat, Simon.  Since last year we have been working to lower Simon's weight by lowering his calorie content. He has gone from 19 lbs 2 oz a year ago to 17 lb 14 ounces. I did the research and found that this formula is among the lowest in Kcal per cup.  Simon and his housemates had no difficulty with adjusting to this food.  When I put the empty bag on the floor last night, Simon crawled into the bag and licked the bag off of me.  I am not sure how Simon did this. He"
"We love these Biodegradable Trash bags for our bathroom waste baskets. They are the perfect size and are compostable so less goes in the landfill. TL;DR Great for waste baskets, garbage bags and recycling bags but very handy for your recycling and disposal needs."
"Very good product.  Works really well. No issues.  Turns good with zero problems.  Like the style, looks great next to my K Brewer.  Would recommend to those who want an inexpensive K cup holder that looks and works well. TL;DR Nifty Carousel for 35 K-Cups, Chrome and Stainless.

"I've had a lot of excellent halva in my life. It's seems it would be difficult to spoil it, but not in this case. It is a disgrace to call this product a halva! Granulated Domino Sugar - yes, but not a halva. It has a lot more sugar than any other brand and all you can feel are crunchy sugar crystals when you're chewing it. Do not buy! TL;DR Plain SUGAR...but it is a halva. I'm a bit disappointed that I've been"

This recipe is super simple and easy to make.

"Just returned from a trip to Scotland where I was introduced to Branston Pickle by our most-gracious host.  I love this stuff.  It's got tang.  It's got crunch.  It's got lots of flavors.  As a vegetarian I am always looking for ways to make vegetables more interesting.  Due to the ridiculous weight and ""liquid"" restrictions on the airlines, I could bring home only one jar of Pickle so I am delighted to find it is available for purchase.  I have a lot of pickle in my kitchen and it"
"I've always loved chocolate covered raisins. Dark chocolate covered raisins are even better. Nestles may not be the best, but they're still delicious. I just keep telling myself the raisins make them healthier. TL;DR My favorite ""junk"" food is chocolate covered raisins, but you can always try some from my website"
"You see this hot sauce very popular at most oriental restaurants.  Not only because of the low price but because of its terrific flavor.  You get 17oz (compare that with the skinny tabasco bottle) of hot spice that will last for a very long time.  Great especially for soup lovers who want to spike it up a notch.  Also good with your pizzas, burritos, nachos,... and more. TL;DR Great Chili Sauce - Great!

A very nice and spicy chili sauce which tastes just like any other"
"Although the price initially seems a bit more than other cat foods, if you add water to it like the instructions say, you end up saving a lot of money...possibly up to the thousands in vet's bills (I recently spent $3,200 because my cat got sick from contaminated food...watch out for Nutro dry cat food. Many pet owners have has sick/dead pets becasue of it). My boys like the taste, especially when mixed with Evolution Moist Food. I tried a little of it. I've heard that it was a little bitter and it"
"My cat, Sterling, is a rather picky chap and, after trying what I thought were every affordable and healthy canned cat food in my area, I finally stumbled upon this one. My cat loves every flavor but turkey, though I doubt it's the brand, he just doesn't like turkey. Anyway, my usual pet store is sadly taking these off the shelves, so I supose I'll be buying it here. This food is well rounded and (according to my cat) delicious. He will eat it in the middle of the summer with a nice, juicy slice of"

"The right combination of sweet and spicy, perfect on Brie and crackers.  I never thought about cooking with this, but since I found it at Costco for $7.99 (twice the amount that comes in the jar) it would be wonderful on chicken or some seafood. TL;DR This stuff is fantastic and I am so pleased with the quality! It's a great way to make"
"I bought this sauce as a closeout. I thought my husband would like the spicy honey mustard. He did, but now I am addicted and trying to find a source to purchase more in my area of the mid-west.<br /> The best description is the flavor is complex with several different notes. First you get sweet, then a sour and spicey but fruity undernote followed by a nice but not too hot burn. Also the sauce has a great texture with pieces of onion complementing the spicy honey. The sauce does have some bitterness, but it is not overpower"
"labeling says one serving has 11 grams of fat but less than one gram saturated. since most of the fat comes from coconut oil the saturated fat should be quite high like in comparable banana chip products. i called them and emailed them about this. they said they'd get back to me but never did. i  love their banana chips but the labeling is definitely incorrect about the saturated fat content. TL;DR confusing label and misleading. i am not a health food person.

I don't"
"I read many diverse reviews for this product, but I believe it only works if you use it properly. I learned that it not only about taking a pill, you got to make sure you eat extra food and drink extra liquids. Also timely pumping or breastfeeding is very important too. I noticed, as soon I'd start extracting or taking pills at different times, milk amounts would start messing up. So I started pumping 4 times a day, every 6 hours, day or night, and it became stable. I had a few problems, such as the sudden drop in water temperature when"
"I, personally, am not a big pumpkin spice person.  I like pumpkin pie, ice cream, etc. but the pumpkin and spice coffee somehow just doesn't do it for me.  During the Fall I usually get one or at the most two pumpkin related drinks, then I'm done until next season.  I mostly got this because my girlfriend loves pumpkin spice flavored coffees from places like Starbucks.  I tried it and thought the flavor was a little weird tasting, not bad necessarily - but I guess I just didn't like it. I think I would have loved"
"This mayo is tops!  Just right on many traditional Japanese dishes such as Takoyaki or Okonomiyaki...also perfect on pizza, burgers, even steamed veggies!  I bought mine at the asianfoodgrocer site for around $7 including shipping; my Takoyaki never had it so good! TL;DR Yummie!

I am so sorry, I didn't mean what I said. "
"The juniper plant I received died within a month of planting.<br />After I did some research, I found that it does the best outside of the home, which Eve's Garden failed to mention in the product instructions.<br />I gave it one star because it shipped well and was fun while it lasted. I will not be getting anything from this manufacturer again. TL;DR Disappointment in the product description and a little bit of disappointment in the product description.

"What can I say this is totally my own viewpoint but I LOVE this stuff. To me heating is optional. I have to buy this at a health food store 20 miles away from me but I make the trek every month and stock up. I usually by every can they have (like 6) I have a very hard time not eating the entire can in one sitting. Good gracious I love this Stuff! Oh and when they say spicy buttermilk sauce, it's really a highly spiced sauce, not to be confused with spicy soy sauce or anything. It tastes like chili"
"This is awful.  So, I got out the pots and pans and made a great no salt, little sugar and no butter fat tomato Soup using fresh tomatoes.  Tastes much, much better than this Tomato Soup! TL;DR Yucky and way too sweet.

3 cups water, at room temperature"
"Campbells is the best of the canned Manhattan CC's.  Bookbinders clams are dry.  Progresso is so-so.  When I was a kid you could always get this in the grocery stores in Chicago.  I never see it out here in Tucson.  One place carried it for a while and then stopped.  I've asked various grocers if they could order it for me by the case, but they said no.<br /><br />Add to your collection of canned and bottled goods. You may need to get a bottle"

"The granola on the outside make these more appealing than just a flavored rawhide.  I uploaded 4 photos to show the rawhide below the granola layer.<br /><br />In sum - my dog will be getting these for the rest of her life.  She loves them, and rawhide keeps her teeth healthy, so it's a no brainer.<br /><br />This is probably her favorite rawhide treat.  She also loves the regular Busy Rollhide, so this one is pretty good for her!<br />Thanks!<br"

"My son loves this cereal, especially with chocolate soymilk. This company also makes Koala Crisp Cereal, if we have that, my kids will mix the Panda Puffs with the Koala Crisp (which has a chocolate flavor) as they think it tastes like a Reese Cup. I like that there are only 7g of sugar per serving (much less than many kids cereals) and all the ingredients are organic. Once in milk this cereal will also stay crispy a little longer.

This cereal is also delicious as the only other cereal to make a"
"My dog is 3 years old and a very picky eater. These are her favorite treats. She is a 7 lb Yorkie, so I cut the treats in about 6 pieces. They last much longer that way and she will actually not take a whole one anymore because they are too big. TL;DR My pups love these treats! I've seen them all but they all look just a tad bigger."
"My cats wouldn't eat them even without pills in them. I have one cat who is fussy so this wasn't a surprise, but I have another cat who will eat anything on the floor, including non-food items, but would not touch these ""treats."" TL;DR Just Awful!

This was a big mistake, but I am happy I did not"

"I purchased this product and the seasoning is very good. I am, however, very dissapointed with their shipping charges. I had sent the seller an email stating that their shipping charge was excessive ($7.50) for such a small item. I received no response. The spice jar (3.5oz) arrived in a small box sent via USPS, and the USPS label on the front showed the cost of $2.38 for shipping. So faerie's finest makes an extra $7.50 for shipping, and that's just for the shipping costs and not"
"I get this olive oil through Subscribe and Save and really like it.  It has a good flavor and is great for baking, frying, etc.  I even like the tins, and I use a can opening to remove the tops when the tins are empty and use them for cute storage.  The price has gone WAY up recently though, which is really frustrating. Amazon has a history of jacking the price up on anything that sells well or gets good reviews. I depended on my friends to get my order and they've got to pay me, but that doesn"
"This was a magical box of mixed K-cups full of the most excellent and delicious flavors of coffee one could conceive.  Every flavor in the package was exceptionally delicious.  Also, there were quite a few of the limited edition or seasonal varieties in here, but none of the weird ones that nobody ever drinks.  I bought this for a gift but I'll be ordering another for me to enjoy.  When I opened the package and started reading all the flavors, I kept trying to talk to myself, because I didn't know what I was talking about.  But"

My kids love these sucker. They are a million times better than any other. I don't feel so guilty giving these to them. TL;DR amazing! Thanks for your help with this!
This is just one of two types of canned fruit from Roland that I do NOT like.  It's like they picked totally unripened  pineapples and just sliced and packed them in the unripened fruit juices.  They are really quite awful!  The one and only can I opened... I ended up throwing out 75 % of it.  The remaining 11 cans I plan to use in making smoothies or on top of hams being cooked or anywhere that pineapples are cooked. I can only hope that these are a success for my family and that

"The cheese has a very creamy texture, even for a NY cheddar that I would put more in line with Gouda. Typically aged cheddars seem sharp with a hint of cream but this had a very strong chocolate overtone which is the unexpected part and followed by the typical creaminess. It's pretty unique if you're new to aged or exotic cheeses. I would say this cheese pairs well with an aged Riesling or a milk stout if you prefer beer.<br /><strong>""I think it's the perfect compliment to my favorite cheese, and"
"This is a very tasty meal, and I would recommend it with either white rice or bread. Note that it is a little spicy (for my palate)! TL;DR Very good prepacked food that is delicious.

"If you like the soft type of gummy bears rather than the more chewy kind (like Haribo), you will love these.  They have a wide variety of flavors that really taste different, unlike some generic brand gummy bears that have different colors, but taste very similar.  These favorably compare to the old Amazin Fruit gummy bears that used to be popular.<br /><br />These bears are delicious! TL;DR Great flavors, very soft,  excellent gummy bear flavors, great texture (like Haribo) and very good taste. "
"Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.  Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with a new cat food and the cat's first meal was a good treat, which"
"If your cat needs to take pills, these pockets work great! My 16-year old cat needs to take a steroid pill daily and he does so willingly when I put them in these pockets. They come in two flavors and both work well. Highly recommended! TL;DR Pill pockets for cats are not recommended to your cat for the same reason: They aren't for you"
"Oh man, I love me some peach rings.  Haribo brand peach rings are quite good, in small doses.  I find their flavor to be stronger than most, which is good, but I also can't plow through pounds of them at a time like I can some other brands.  Still, the flavor is excellent, and the quantity here is even more fantastic.  Just be sure to seal them up nice and tight or they might go bad before you finish.

The box contains 48 strings of 4 individually wrapped pieces, for a total of 192 pieces.  This is basically the same as the Zotz candy that was popular back in the 1970s, but it's now imported from Italy.

My 5 month old aussie/border collie mix puppy liked this game a lot. It's pretty durable. You hide the treats in the cups and your pup has to find them. I think the best part about this game is that it is 3 games in 1. Some of the games were easier for him to understand how to play quicker than others. My puppy was able to learn all 3 of the games pretty quickly. The instructions and set up are simple. I wish there were more of these. I'm very impressed with how this game works. I've played it
"The product itself is good. Supposed to be different fruit flavors but I can't tell the difference. However my local grocery has these for $2 each and had a $1 off coupon a while ago.

"I was a little disappointed to find that the amount of spice is actually quite small. I find it difficult to figure out size and weighting with spices on line because some of it can depend on packaging.  But with the cut of the spices, you really only get about 1.5 T of spices.  Flavors and blend are otherwise good though I was further disappointed to find that this blend lacks Chervil - something I didn't notice before ordering. Had I seen that, I would have ordered it.

"After reading all the positive raves about these products, I decided to give them a try. Having fresh lemons and limes isn't always possible and these are excellent substitutes. I like them so much that I'll need to invest in the large shaker size for home use and save the packets for carrying in my purse. I've added these to water and various teas (both hot and cold) and for cooking. I really like the lemon sprinkled on fish.

I don't understand how others have tasted any flavoring at all because I sure didn't, I so wanted something all natural that would taste good but this is just drinking sugar water so now I have to find something to add some flavor to the water.

These are better (crunchier) than baked chips and are packed with protein. The product comes in several flavors. My top favorites are BBQ and lightly salted.

Not due to any allergies, but peanuts contain high levels of L-Arginine, an amino acid that is known to build muscle mass but may also inhibit the immune system (or so I have read). Sunbutter is very tasty, especially so if you like sunflower seeds. I like it better than peanut butter, and the fat composition is supposed to be healthier for you, so why wouldn't you want to try it? Sunbutter is a great way of reducing the"

"This is the most impressive, right down to the soul, just almost like your Mama used to make! Makes you want to eat more! The Richness of the Maple is there but yet is not overwhelming and likewise the sweetness of that Brown Sugar compliments it fully; it just cannot be beat! Had given this to my grandchildren who HATES oatmeal, without even saying what it was - and they wanted MORE not even knowing what it was. This is all good for you, with genuine Oats goodness!

I had this recipe for breakfast at my friend's house,"

"my nutritionist recommended the kind bar as afternoon snack. I LOVE the bar, it is a treat for me and have lost 14 pounds in 5 months.

And the best of it all ""it is good for you.""<br />I love this flavor and my other favorites are the Dark Chocolate cherry cashew and nuts with pistachio.

Since the handle is flat, it is difficult to pick up the server and then open the lid with one hand.

"I decided to try ""The Switch"" orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all-natural and it happens to be carbonated.<br /><br />The taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and I have to be truthful, at first I wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first.<br /><br />But after tasting it, you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and citrus juice.<br /><br />The flavor is so much"

The best tea in my book. Great service. Very good selection."
"I read all the reviews of this product and couldn't wait to use it. I took it for over a week when my baby started to get extremely fussy. The doctor determined she had colic, changed my diet, added special formula - still was not producing enough breast milk, and took me off all vitamins. After a week, she was becoming our happy baby again. I started taking this product again and within three days she started screaming again. I immediately stopped taking this and within a few hours, she was back to normal. It's the only thing I could think"
"This is a great start for the morning breakfast, afternoon energy boost, and bedtime warm snack.  I found this in Florida and tried it.  Now that this SNOWBIRD is back north I couldn't find it in any store here.  It is quick and easy to make in the microwave and I usually make enough to have some in the frig for a quick warm up.

Wonderful, as far as it goes, but that entire batch must have been bad because the cats would not eat it. It is the only real difference between the two, which is why"
"I love this product! BUT the downside is that I was overcharged. When I saw that the cost of this product was $10.00 I assumed that it meant $10.00 for a case. When I received only one can, I was stunned to say the least. A few days ago I happened upon this product at a grocery store. The 8.1 oz was $1.29. I am hereby requesting my change back!!!!!!  Rumford is one of the best baking spices.

"This juice is rich, tasty with full-bodied taste.  I use it to make fruit juice shakes and in my protein shakes.

To me it has a very nutty taste. I like the glass jar Cafix better, but I can also drink the same amount with coffee, which I love. I'm going to try this one"

In the past, cooking beans meant hours of soaking and boiling which meant planning ahead and watching the pot so the water didn't cook out. Canned beans are not an option here.

I found these cashews too salty and peppery for my taste. There is also a hint of onion flavor with some citric acid to give them a slightly sour taste.

What a disppointment to see that they come in distasteful brown paper bag packaging with a 90 day expiration sticker right on the front!

The coffee doesn't have the smoothness of the real Kona, is a bit on the harsher side. Probably ok for a run-of-the-mill cofee, but not much better. Wish I had bought a smaller bag first!

"My regular matzo farfel was out of stock so I decided to try this whole grain version as a healthy alternative. Big Mistake. Before you order this stuff, make sure you taste some whole grain matzo first --- if you like the flavor than go ahead. It comes out much darker and more fibrous than regular matzo farfel. In our family this stuff was a big flop. My wife decided to throw the other five cans in the garbage as she didn't want to waste her money.

They're quite filling and the juxtoposition of a crunchy outside with a jam-like inside made for an excellent snack.

"This is a great mix for a 9x13 or two round pans.  It's plenty of dough to do the job nicely.  This came out nice and moist and provides a great base for experiments...  We wanted a lemon cake one day for a special birthday for my husband's celiac mother.  We used a little lemon extract and lemon zest in the cake.  After it was baked we mixed a little sugar with lemon juice, heated it and poured in on top the cake. I used a small piece of a lemon peel to cut a small slice off"

I recommend using half water and half skim milk. I usually mix 5 oz water with 5 oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes.  Add the packet and sugar or sweetener.

"Other reviews have detailed the benefits of this coffee maker.  I just wanted to add that the coffee you brew up can be very easily stored.  Just let it cool a bit and then place the carafe in the fridge.  The coffee doesn't come out bitter (probably because it doesn't sit on a hot burner).  I used a french press for a long time but it's now gathering dust thanks to this coffee maker. TL;DR Excellent for multiple cups, easy to store.

He is my new little fur ball so I have been very cautious about what he eats and the type of foods that he is exposed to.

After doing some reading, I realized that my pup was really curious, and the trainers were really nice to me. "
"As a big fan of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies, both the original and the chewy, I was prepared to love these as well. But it was just a big glob of mushy chocolate, barely held together with a tiny bit of cookie. Now, like most people, I'm pretty enthusiastic about chocolate, and theoretically, there is simply no such thing as ""too much."" But it just didn't taste right here.

"This is a darned nice ginger snap. They're very dry and crisp (for snappiness), and have a good strong ginger flavor -- strong enough to give you a tingle on your tongue if you wolf down a handful of them one after the other, as I'm prone to do. They might be too strongly gingery for some kid's tastes, and better for the cookie-loving grownups in the family. TL;DR Gingery and snappy ginger, both great for snacking in small amounts.

"When we first got out new belgian waffle maker, we made a few throw-away batches to break it in and then made our first true made-to-eat waffle using the store bought Aunt Jamima and it tasted OK.  The next day my partner used the Golden Malted Pancake mix (which is actually healthier according to nutirition label) and it tasted 10X as good as the other.  In fact, just as good as any restuarant or hotel meal, it's so much better than most other meals that we're still going"

"This fruit leather is made from 100% fruit (actually, it does have ""natural strawberry flavor"") and tastes great! Of the flavors I've tried, strawberry is my favorite with grape taking a close second. They make a great low calorie snack. TL;DR Delicious snack!

I love this recipe and it comes together really well with the ingredients"
This is an all-time favorite tea of mine. I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tea - and this tea really hits the spot in my favorite top ten list of teas. The only downfall about this tea is that it is not made with strings. I like to have strings on my bags of tea. But no matter what this is the best peppermint tea i've ever drank!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings is a great brand.<br /><br />I've used this tea in several recipes for years. I've never found

"It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey's milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S.

"We've been eating this for years. In fact since before they changed the name. It was originally named with a three letter word (similar to darn) that Amazon won't let me write. We've tried quite a number of variations of this and it always turns out good. Sausage works well. Add cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar cheese, or bacon when serving. We only buy from Amazon as they have the best pricing so sometimes we have to wait for stock but it's worth it.

If you like this place, please give a 5 star"

So I bought a couple of tins at my local grocery.  Today I opened one and found out 1) they are now blueish in color and 2) the taste is terrible!  What prompted Wrigley or whomever to change these?

"I LOVE these colors. I used them in pastry school to make brightly colored buttercreams and fondants, and there really is no substitute. In a lot of confection making, using too much color will ruin the formula and your product will come out poorly. These colors have worked for even the most delicate uses! I was so excited to be able to buy my own, and I'm sure they'll be getting a lot of use in the near future. :) TL;DR Amazing color payoff. The colors are so great!

"I suppose we are all creatures of habit. Mine is coffee, lot's of it. I like a well made percolator coffee, but years ago I discovered Tasters Choice. It's my favorite instant, hands down. Just put a teaspoons-worth in a coffee cup of water and nuke it in the microwave for 1:45 (well, in MY micro, anyway). The coffee is strong for some tastes; do you like espresso? Well, not that strong but definitely potent. You can buy a Taker Choice or even just one for under $10,"
"I was skeptical of this product at first. I saw a chef use them on TV and was intrigued by the thought of a 'no calorie noodle.' I boiled the water and used a hand strainer to rinse them. When you cut the package open the noodles have a terrible sour smell which freaked me out at first because that smell would taste terrible. However, when you rinse the noodles well and drop them into very hot boiling water, they have no taste at all. It was pretty amazing how they turned out. I'm not sure if this can happen to a lot"
"These are surprisingly good for a bar that is essentially fruits and nuts smashed together.  Everything involved in these bars at least sounds healthy, so I was expecting to taste cardboard.

This is an excellent men's shampoo that should be used once or twice a week to keep your scalp feeling great and moisturized. I wouldn't recommend using it everyday as zinc pyrithione may scour the scalp if used a lot. Think of it as an exfoliating treatment for your head.<br /><br />I have read reports that Zinc pyrithione may reduce hair shedding and I have read reports that excessive use may cause hair shedding. So my advice is to not use it and just get it in the shower. I have seen this product
"I have tried several different brands of Earl Grey including a couple of loose leaf varieties from fancy tea boutiques. I really must admit that Bigelow's version is probably one of my top two favorites (Stash also makes a nice Earl Grey). It has a nice smooth and balanced flavor and the bergamot is spot on. I also like that it is all natural and made with real bergamot oil. It is also easy to find in almost any grocery store. Five stars from Bigelow's, a nice little addition!

The only hard this is that she can't open the cap by herself (which I don't mind, or else, she's ""break into them"").  The cap is also resealable, which is nice in case.  I highly recommend these. I used to buy Ella's Kitchen Organic Smoothies and baby food pouches, but they are so much better than that and I don't even have to buy them."

These ""Fruit thins"" have a little bit of a European taste about them in that they are not really very sweet. The fruit bits are chewy and there is quite a bit of Citrus flavor in the entire cookie. All in all a tasty cookie as long as you are not expecting an Oreo. TL;DR I like these, but the kids are not sure...but I like them anyway because they are very similar to my other cookies.

I tasted some of this avocado oil alone and it is a bit stronger than ""buttery"" olive oil as it does have a bit of a 'bite'. I still do like it, though. I've used it for sauteing, on toast with onion or garlic powder and with my favourite cheese like Parmesan cheese or the perfect little sauce to serve"

"Such an amazing, clean taste.  I used to have to hunt down excellent-quality salts, but it is so easy to order this on Amazon.  I love a briny salt sometimes, but it doesn't go with everything.  The celtic salt is totally all-purpose -- I use it in baking and to salt just about anything.  The one issue with it is that it's a very moist salt so it doesn't have the easy-pour most people hope for.  It's also not a great mixer, but it's a nice, clean"

I am a very picky person when it comes to non-fat dry milk.  I specifically ordered this product for a dry cocoa mix or hot chocolate mix I was making for friends during the holidays.  This Organic Valley Non-Fat Dry Milk makes it taste just like milk!  My mix turned out perfect - tastes just like Carnation or Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate Mix when you add water to it.

"I can't say I'd recommend this coffee.  If not for the convenience, I wouldn't ever have rebought it, but now I've found a better choice for regular coffee in the Tassimo - either Starbucks Breakfast Blend, or Jacobs Kronung.  Both beat this coffee hands down in flavor.  The Jacobs doesn't make as much coffee though.<br />This coffee tastes like vending machine coffee at a highway rest stop - the kind from a machine that hasn't been tended to by a while.

I have been cutting unnecessary sugars and alcohol from my diet but had an annual camping trip planned where there would be drinking and didn't want to be left out of all the fun!  I am so glad I bought this mix!  It's delicious and I ended up sharing with a few others who agreed--it does have a very sweet taste, so it tasted like a sweet lemonade, even without the lemon flavor.  The lemonade is great as a topping, though"
"I've tried a couple of other coffees through amazon.  The best was probably Cameron's Organic French Roast, but just by a hair above the Dark Brazilian Santos. Another one I tried was Coffee Bean Direct French Roast Papua New Guinea which really didn't taste like real french roast.It was just okay.  The worst was Eight O'Clock French Roast.  The beans were pale, not oily and this was reflected in the pale boring taste of the brewed coffee. As far as the coffee was concerned, it had a lot of flavor in it."
"I've never been one to write a review on anything, but I just had to comment on the primrose Filled Red Raspberry Candy.  Needless to say, there are NONE left as I thought I could keep these little treasures to myself, but my son couldn't stay away from them.  They are absolutely delicious and brought back memories of my childhood days when I would pick out these pieces from the holiday mixed candy that my mother would bring home.  In fact, once I complete this project, I am sure I will be able to add to this list of great"
"This is one of the most popular flavors of drink mix around this house. It has good flavor and is quick and easy to make. I like the new packaging much better. And shopping here on Amazon is great as it is cheaper than Crystal Light at Walmart, but not cheaper than the GV brand (which is probably the same stuff). TL;DR Good tasting drink with excellent flavor but very expensive.

This drink has been great to make"
"My puppy loves it, and I love my puppy.  She doesn't eat a whole lot just yet, but she will soon.  Looks like it costs about $50-$60 for a month's supply.  Considering that I spend that much on myself in a week, I'll gladly spend that much on my sweet Layla for a month.  The better you spend on dog food, the less you'll spend in the veterinarian's office.  And that's exactly what I told my mom. She said she'd give it a try, because she'd never eat"
"These are great as a healthy snack. I find them quite tasty, but I do not like the ones without the sesame seeds! Easy to throw in a lunchbox and better than 99% (if not 100%) of what's in most vending machines when you want (need?) something a little salty and gluten free. TL;DR relatively healthy snack!"
"I was looking for some great matcha that I can use for tea, lattes, etc. This is wonderful! I use my hand mixer to blend it in milk with some agave nectar and it makes a great latte! :o) TL;DR Great product! :D

"This stuff is absolutely terrible. There was pretty much zero taste despite the ungodly amount of salt it seemed to contain. I think it would make decent bomb shelter food, that's about it. TL;DR gag me with a fork and stick. It doesn't have much flavor and is just plain boring, which"
"I liked this flavor and the whole single cup system. I am not a avid coffee drinker, but I do like an occasional couple of cups a day. However, I will go several days between drinking any coffee.The single cups last and store longer with no waste.The key to this and all single cup coffee's is the water level. Just a bit more or less water in the coffee blend is critical to the taste.I find that if I fill my coffee cup with too much water, the coffee will not be as strong. However, I find that if a"
All my cans were smashed up and one was open. Reminded me of the opening scene in Ace Ventera pet Detective. Its was that bad. Dont think Ill reorder. Maybe go with C2O heard thats the cats pajamas. TL;DR Crushed cans. Good for you but you can't buy a full-size one for yourself.

I'm going to have to buy lots more of it.<br /><br />Third, the ingredients are Organic, grain free, and contains no gluten.  I'm not sure if the ingredients are gluten free or non"
This is the best spice I've ever used for my cooking. It used to be sold at Whole Foods. Now it seems to only be available here at Amazon.com. I'm happy as long as I can purchase it somewhere.

When the coffee house closed a couple of years ago we didn't even know how to get it again until last summer when we went to Seattle on vacation.

TL;DR market spice tea is now our favorite way to drink Market Spice Tea, but if you are looking"
"So, I tasted this nummy granola, and it was quite satisfactory. Granted, I probably wouldn't reach for it to just snack on plain (i.e. just the granola itself. Instead, I decided to add it to my Greek yogurt. Mmmmmm! LOVED it! It wasn't too crunchy, and by the time I was done with my yogurt and granola, it wasn't soft/mushy/soggy; the granola didn't seem so much like it had been sitting in your fridge for a while,"
Of all the Ostrim products I personally like these best.

"As far as Pop-Tarts go, this particular flavor is pretty good. I really like the brown sugar filling, and the frosting is also good. The crust is your basic white bread stuff, it would be nice if they had put some cinnamon in the crust too or something, but this Pop-Tart is still overall pretty good. TL;DR Pretty good for $5.00.

"After a year in France buying very high quality chocolate of 70% or higher, at a typical price of about $1.50/100g, I was dismayed to see that in the USA such products routinely fetch $3 or $4 per 100g.  Outrageous!  Then I found Lindt 90% (and others) at Amazon for nearly as good a price as in supposedly expensive France. This is the smoothest textured high density chocolate widely available in the USA. It's a very smooth, sweet cocoa, with a very good finish, a"
"Pork Ramen is arguably the Holy Grail of Ramen. For reasons that will confound scholars for centuries to come, you cannot find pork flavor in the store. When I found out pork flavor was available through amazon.com, I felt much like Tom Hank's wife must have felt in Castaway when she found out he was still alive. I was thrilled, I was happy to see Pork Ramen, but I had moved on...I had let it go. It arrived in my local ramen shop, where it was a huge hit. I was excited to"
"Too often I find black teas develop an unappealing bitterness, but that is not a problem with this lively decaf tea.  I had every intention of ordering the decaf Earl Grey because I love bergamot, but my order was hijacked by an unleashed desire to try something new.  Most decaffeinated beverages produce a different flavor and strength from their unprocessed counterpart, but the full mouth flavor remains intact with this tea.  It is a combination of black teas, black tea, and white tea that are not quite as complex as the black"

"These pickles are pickled in acetic acid even though the label in English reads brine in large print implying that they are pickled in brine. The can's small print (which is NOT visible in the picture) does report the truth. The use of brine instead of vinegar as a pickling agent results in a tremendous difference in taste. I'm stuck with 12 cans of pickles in vinegar (acetic acid). Vinegar pickles I can get anywhere, and besides I get some pickles that I think are really good, but I can't get"

"These cookies are very soft, chewable, and delicious! The only problem I had with them is that each cookie is pretty tiny, so I kept eating them. And that means the calories add up in a hurry, as only two of these are 150 calories with 7 grams of fat.  There's almost no way to eat only two.  I don't know if they're quite ""gooey"" as the label claims, but they are quite good. TL;DR Delicious! I'd give them 4 stars if I could, but they definitely taste good."
"I am on a sodium restricted diet of my own choice. I also prefer raw nuts for health reasons.  Delivery is prompt, and the product keeps well in the freezer.

"I bought this variety basket for my brother's birthday, he is both a foodie and a man into anime and manga.  It was a lot of fun, a bit smaller than I had hoped.. and had average candy you can pretty much find in specialty shops in the US (if you live in a major city, you can probably find a lot of this stuff in any asian food store) If you live in the middle of nowhere or a small city.. this was worth not driving to, but I was willing to take the risk of it being the cheapest thing around"
"I was searching for an adult food to transition my 8-lb Havanese to and came across Chicken Soup.  Not only does she love it (and beg for more), but it seems to agree well with her sometimes sensitive stomach!!  The price is reasonable and I was pleased with the ingredients when compared to other foods.  The food pellets are a good size as well.  I purchased the 6lb bag as a tester, but will probably stick with this size in the future since it is a bit thicker. It does not have a large filling so I will"
Lemon juice comes in handy when you need to rinse off the body wash you used to get clean and then you still feel soapy. Sooooo enstead of using gallons of extra water to rinse the body wash off just take a half cup of Lemon Juice to a gallon of water and the refreshing feeling has cleaned you off soap free. Alittle more water rinses off the lemon juice and you are a happy person. So at less than $2 a 32 oz. bottle (and you don't want to spend more than $10 for half a bottle of water)

"My husband found Numi's Desert Lime tea ""too weird"" so I had to find a Numi variety he would also drink.  I still get Desert Lime but keep it to myself.  Since he already liked green tea, I figured this Jasmine Green was already partially in the ballpark so I bought it.  He loved it.  This tea also has a wonderful aroma (that is Jasmine obviously).  If I am going to serve Numi tea to someone, this is the only way. I will be ordering more.

However, after ordering a carton of these crackers, I had to quickly put them all in freezer bags because ALL of the packages had a hole in them and there were cracker crumbs all over the place. I should have been able to take the packages out of the box and store them away in my cabinets without worrying about roaches crawling into the rips in the bags and getting in my kitchen.

"If you are looking for a nutty snack that is not too sweet, this might be for you.  My husband and I both tried them.  He thinks this is more of a 5 star item.  He liked the fresh nuts with just a bit of a cocoa taste, and though I liked them, I would say they are maybe in the three star category, because I was hoping for something slightly sweeter.  We both liked that the coating was not a ""come off in your throat"", like a ""sugar rush"", but we would like to try this"

I found a recipe online on how to make sticky rice with mango (I always crave this dessert when we go to Thai restaurants) and it was easy peasy with this rice.

"Well, it's a steak sauce, so what's to say?  I've always like Heinz 57 for its tart and complex taste, but some people might not, so it's subjective (surprise!).  I'll say that this deal (4 x 20 ounce bottles) for around $22 is a great price.  My local grocery stores charge about $5-6 for ONE 10 ounce bottle.  If it takes you a long time to go through 4 large bottles, give one the thought.

"These would have been a lot better if they hadn't coated them in splenda. Bleh I wish that it was clearly printed on the front of this product that it contained sucralose and I would have chosen another flavor. That's something I feel should be clearly printed on the front of the label and not hidden in the ingredients list on the back. I do not eat sucralose because it causes my eczema to flair and I feel that if it's doing that then it must be a product made with it because it's not sucralose.

"I purchased a can of Roland mackerel in soy oil at my local grocery store, and found within delicious small (like large sardines) fish. On that basis I ordered this item from Amazon. The fish in these cans is much larger: each can contains just part of single fish. The flavor is fine but my concern is that these are king mackerel, which are less healthy for your diet than other species (as you can check yourself with an Internet search). There is less protein in these canned fish. I also found that it is easier to digest and"

"My dad got an assortment of these to give as a silly little Christmas gift for us (we are adults now).  I really wasn't expecting much from them, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are mild, but good tasting and not sickly sweet.  Similarly, the carbonation turns out to have a pleasant effect rather than the gut-busting feeling you get from drinking soda.  I was also happy to see that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar (as I have been doing). The flavors are very good for an ice-"

"Now that I have found nirvana in the form of red licorice, there is no reason to keep trying other brands.  The texture is completely satisfying, the way the log gives way to soft chewy goodness, the way the hint of slightly sour essence of pure raspberry rises to the top.  Unlike other high end licorice I've tried, there are no artificial colors like Kookaburra, and the texture is so much more RIGHT than Panda (which has more than its fair share of flaws).  This makes it very interesting, and I"
"Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal.

There are lots of everything, it all tastes fresh (well, as fresh as dehydrated fruit can taste...) and no sodium.  Even the pistachios, which often tend to get a bit soft in mixes like this, are still fairly crunchy.  And, of course, there are some of the cranberries, which are very sweet with"

"These taste like regular rice krispies but sweeter, they are good, but actually a little too sweet for me (which I thought was impossible). There is no visible frosting on the cereal, it looks like a normal rice krispie but when you eat it, it's much much sweeter. The taste is great. The frosting taste is like Frosted Flakes. I also don't like how the cereal gets soggy so quickly in milk. Also, don't buy it if it doesn't taste right.

We had used another brand before but could no longer find it, so we searched the Internet and found this one. Unfortunately, it was more of an excessively sweet jam/jelly than a smooth sauce.

"My dog, Blue, is about 85 pounds and 11 or 12 years old -- he loves me and follows me everywhere.  Over the last 3 or 4 years, he has slowed down and can't seem to get up as quickly as he used to or bound up the stairs after me.<br /><br />Based on a friend's recommendation, I started feeding Happy Hips to Blue -- about 6 a day -- he gobbles them up and seems to have a lift back in his steps. He is always smiling. He is also very happy about what's going on in"
"My canine companion is a 132 pound, five year old, Shiloh Shepherd.  The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weeding when he became the 'G.I.' He was born with a '"
"I have used Frontier dried herbs, etc. for over twenty years.  I did NOT realize until recently that I could buy them in bulk on Amazon.  I am very glad that I able to use the herbs from Frontier, + get them at a reasonable price when I order them in bulk. TL;DR AWESOME!! The only downside I am afraid to mention is that you have to order the"
"The chips came quickly and they were fresh, but they really need more garlic and onion flavoring.  I probably won't order this again. TL;DR Disappointed.

This is a good garlic and onion flavored pizza. It is really"
"I had a craving for this while I was pregnant, and ate it almost every day. Th flavor is excellent, and true to the directions, it only takes 12 minutes to make. Use a nonstick pan, and keep it on a full boil just like it says. Worth every penny! You won't be dissapointed! TL;DR Excellent flavor and great price."
"If you love flavored coffees you will love this.  They do a nice job of delivering a noticeable vanilla flavor.  If you find the artificial aftertaste that most flavor coffees have unpleasant then you will probably not like this.  The smell is luscious and I think I would make it just for the smell alone. TL;DR Smell is luscious,I think I would make it just for the smell alone

Coffee is great but not as strong. It can be quite"
"I received the product very fast...and this is my second time ordering from them. The coffee is very good, roasted it perhaps Vienna roast just as the oil started to show. I will try a full city next time. I will order this coffee again. TL;DR Peru penachi

"I could not have been more pleased with the speed of delivery and the quality of this product. Have always loved 'good' dark chocolate and Toblerone really is tops in my book. Thanks for making it easy to send sweets to my sweet for Valentines Day. Great job! TL;DR Toblerone sweets!

5 out of 5 Very happy I was very happy with my gift."
"I love granola...in both bar and crumbled form.  So I jumped at the chance to try this Chocolate Delight Granola.  Long story short, it tastes great.  If you like chocolate and granola, you'll like this (that isn't really saying much is it).<br /><br />However, my major problem with granola of any kind is that it isn't particularly healthy.  Don't get me wrong...it isn't like going out and buying granola.  I'm not saying you should go out and buy any"
"Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website. TL;DR Not really olive juice at all, and probably the best part is that it is very good. "
"The purpose of my review is simple:  Know that you are buying a coffee that is flavored.  It's 'chocolate glazed donut' flavored coffee.  I bought 48 of these thinking it was 'donut house' coffee.  Well, it is.  But what I didn't realize is that Donut House is apparently a brand, not a flavor.  The good news is that this flavored coffee doesn't completely suck.  Don't get me wrong, if you like Donut House, then I'm not a coffee lover so that's okay"
"I must say, I was not sure what to expect when ordering these.  I have been trying to stay on a low carb plan for a while, but the one thing I missed a lot was chips/crackers.  I have experimented with baking different things and even trying to fry up my own root vegetables.  Nothing really worked well.<br /><br />I stumbled on these one day and bought the Pizza flavor and the White cheddar.  They are both quite good, however I was not sure if I could find the right cheese in the store that they"

"This used to be the real great one in Northern Italian style espresso - half the price of Illy Normale, and more consistent.  But that's apparently all over now.  I have just had exactly the same experience as D. Cocco reports above.  The coffee was stale, and completely changed - way overbalanced toward one, particularly strong flavor.  I sent a respectful email to them about this, and received no reply.  It wasn't necessary to pay the premium price for such an experience to have such a bad experience, and it was a shame that"
"Excellent service. Speedy delivery and perfectly as advertised. Thank you!<br /><br />It makes excellent bread. My son is gluten intolerant (self diagnosed) and we have found that if you adhere to the recipe on the back of the flour, the break comes out too hard and crumbly for him. We have added an extra teaspoon of yeast, and a half cup extra of liquid. The mixture rises much better now, leaves decent sized CO2 holes in the bread and is much more moist and tender. The only issue with this flour is that it"
"This is THE BEST pizza crust.  Not just the best gluten free pizza crust, but the best pizza crust ever.  I followed the recipe that a previous reviewer gave (less liquid).  The only problem was that my veggie pizza the crust got a little soggy, but that's a problem I have with most crust, but the edges were still crunchy.  The pepperoni/olive was perfect, crust was thin and crisp, and of course oh so tasty. Can't wait to make this again!

This pizza was the perfect size and"
"I moved to the US from the UK almost 18 years ago and for a long time went without my beans on toast; that was until British stores popped up here and there but a 40 mile each way drive was not in the cards for me, not even for beans.  I then found a place about 12 miles away, but they charged the earth for them, then I found amazon carried them.  Ever since then I have them on a standing order for a case every 6 weeks.

"If you can get past the fact that this does not arrive in any form of a ""package"" with the picture that is shown your good!  If you are looking for a great assortment of flavors that would be impossible to get all on your own...then this is for you too.  I was very pleased with the assortment, and how fun to go through and pick your flavor to try each time.  I purchased this for myself since my huband is more loyal to only one plain flavor, which I think I will never get to taste.  It's a nice"
"MiO is a great little way to really up how much water I drink each day. I completely stopped sodas, because the mio, with ice cold water is far better. The peach tea for me is a'sustainable' flavor. I drink it on a daily basis. The others are more 'in the mood' flavors for me. I really enjoy the blueberry pomegranate one as well. I went from drinking nearly no water to drinking 64+oz every day. I think this is going to be the best way to get some of the best"
"While these tea bags make a decent cup of tea, I wouldn't call it chai. It does not taste very spicy, nor does it have a very fragrant aroma. The only spices listed as ingredients are cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and cloves. Celestial Seasons India Spice Chai tea bags list those four spices, plus nutmeg, black pepper, Chinese star anise, chicory and vanilla bean, for a much better cup of chai. TL;DR A nice cuppa with a good flavor and a lot of aroma. If you're a fan"
"the tea has some strong weird taste, not like the fragrant jasmine tea I use to have.  Contacted seller since the product doesn't have an expiration date, but seller refuse to exchange. TL;DR Weird taste. If this was a product you're not used to, I don't know"
"Brought this as a gift, the receiver is still chuckling, and uses it on everything. TL;DR Wonderful.......I'll be doing the same thing again.

"I had purchased this assortment from Costco and of course they no longer carry it.  I tried several times to find this product, even e-mailed Hersheys.  They kept telling me this assortment was available at Krogers and Meijers, not at any of my stores.  The chocolate is awesome and each square is 45 calores.  What is not to love about that.  I would highly recommend this assortment if you love dark chocolate, there is nothing better.

The only negative thing I have about this is that I bought a few"
"I haven't had licorice that tasted like this in years, and I still can't decide if that's a good thing. The Red 40 is a bit disconcerting, and the package can be frustratingly difficult to open (maybe that's good to curb cravings). Couldn't pass the price up as a gift for a licorice fanatic, but promptly cancelled the S&S subscription because halfway thru the 4lbs, we've had more than enough. They're addicting at $9, but they're not as much fun as some licorices"
"I really like the crispness of the cracker.  I have to watch salt and since they have no salt, it makes it easier.  Mine always arrived with no broken crackers and arrive promptly and as promised.  I never have any problems with the crackers staying fresh.  I highly recomment these crackers.  I am always on the lookout for salt free or low salt foods.  Finding one that tastes so good is always a treat. TL;DR rice crackers are great!"
"I LOVED these things!  They're my favorite flavor, and they make an excellent snack.  I tried the chocolate, and oddly enough, as much of a chocoholic as I am, I liked these better!  They're like tiny little delicious shortbread cookies (which I'm normally not even a huge fan of) and they just really hit the spot!  Will definitely have these on a regular basis in our pantry! TL;DR I agree with the first reviewer here that they are good.

Taste: Medium to large

"This is my second review request for this mustard.  Again, I will say that it is my favorite mustard and hard to find in select stores.  I was so happy to see that I could purchase it on Amazon.  This is sure a great place to shop from my mustard to my hard to find shampoos.  This mustard is wonderful on all kind of meats.  My husband is not a mustard lover like me, but he does like this brand and selection. TL;DR - Great mustard on most meats, not too sweet.

I love this"
"Hubby grew up on this product and recently wanted retry it. I find it kind of ironic that it's indeed finding a resurgence lately.....Sunday newspaper coupons as well as TV commmercials for it. Since he's Diabetic, I buy the ""no sugar added"" Vanilla flavor [his favorite]. I tried a sip, and neither of us can detect an aftertaste, however we are both ""no sugar added"" junkies. Neither of us are ingredient experts so we don't know how to make it. We are just curious, so we try to find"

"My wife had seen this at Walgreens but a week later they'd apparently dropped the product line.  After searching at all the usual suspects we were unable to locate it anywhere.  Then we found it here and grabbed a couple of boxes to try out on a birthday cake.  It really does taste great and my wife and young daughter both loved it.  It was quick and easy to make, and just as easy to frost a sugar free birthday cake. TL;DR Great for Diapers, but not a big deal. I think I would recommend it for any"
"Could not find them at Sam's at Christmas time to make my peanut clusters, so was very happy to be able to get them off of Amazon!  Thanks! TL;DR Planters Redskin Spanish Peanuts - I've been using them for years, so I've never been a fan"
I love these! Very hard to find in stores! So it's convenient to order online but they were a bit pricey. All in all a good buy. I received them in a matter of days and they were very fresh! TL;DR Delicious but pricey!
"Buyer beware. The coffee blend for Obsidian appears to have changed (along with the k-cup packaging).  If you are a first time Obsidian buyer it may not matter to you that the Coffee blend has changed but for me, a faithful Obsidian  coffee drinker, it is a huge disappointment and deal changer.  Until recently, Obsidian k-cups were only available at a certain large chain. Now that they have expanded availability, they seem to have changed the whole thing.  I was hoping to see Obsidian k-cups again"
"Wonderful quality for this excellent eccentric culinary pearl. Reconstitutes very well and has wonderful flavor. This is a mushroom that has medicinal properties due to its pronounced levels of beta-glucans and alpha-glucans which are long chain sugars called polysaccharides known to stimulate the immune system in significant ways. Some caution is due with regular and or excessive use of anything that stimulates the immune system. Love of all. PEACE TL;DR Dehydrated Agaricus subrupa (also called Agaricus subrai, subraispera"
"Every time we'd stop somewhere to buy a soft drink, my Mother-in-Law talked about NuGrape being her favorite soft drink when she was a kid and how much she'd love one.<br />When I saw these I ordered them.<br />She was so happy you'd think they were Vintage wine!<br />I tried one and they are really good.<br />One got broken in transit but, fortunately, it never leaked through the carton and 11 arrived safely.<br />I love the wine!<br />I also love the bottle opener"
"The Balance Bar Gold Lemon Meringue Crunch bar is a good energy bar. At 28 percent sugar, 14 grams for a 50 gram bar, it is in the lower range of sugar content for energy bars. It is not too sweet.<br /><br />The bar has a nice lemon flavor. To me, it tastes a lot like lemon meringue pie. I suggest that key lime would also make a nice flavor for this kind of bar. As the product description says, ""No sugar!""<br /><br />This is not a healthy bar! It"
"IT WAS FREE WITH A GREAT MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS TOPPER SO, WHY COMPLAIN?<br /><br />NOT THE BEST FOR MY HEAD, HOWEVER, I NEED TO ELEVATE ME FEET WHEN LYING DOWN SO IT'S A COMFORT FOR THAT. TL;DR Great for Elevating feet. <br /><br />I've seen some of this on reddit, but"

I was a little concerned when I first ordered this product because of the lack of photo, but it turned out fine.  Each filter pack is individually wrapped in separate packaging (like you would find in a hotel) and the 100 of them arrived in a large cardboard box. TL;DR I bought this for my own home. It's been around since 2006 but"
"I was very happy to see a natural dry cat food at Walmart.  I've fed my three cats (ages 11, 6, and 5) this food for months and they all like it.  No diarrhea, no barfing, no problems.  I checked the FDA recall list and it is NOT on it.  The closest search match on the FDA site is NUTRO Natural, not the same product... TL;DR My 3 cats all eat it! I have been using this food in the past, but they have never had diarrhea"

At first I was upset like the other customer thinking they were going to be like the original ones but after eating more than 5 I started getting used to them with their spicyness.

"I love Larabars, and have about 1 a day during the week - so much so, that I have been ordering them in bulk to save a few bucks.  I very much like the spiciness of the Ginger Snap flavor, and is probably my 4th favorite flavor (after the brownie, bluberry muffin and pecan pie).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the latest bars I received were moldy, and they don't expire for months.  This item will be out of the hands of many.  I can't get them in"
"I noticed that a few customers have had a bad experience with the freshness and delivery. I am not denying anyone's trust of their tastebuds. However, I would be remiss if I did not state that I have always received these fresh and delightful-tasting. They have never been delivered broken, as I have ordered 4 cases to-date. I actually prefer the flavor of these to O.N.E. brand. Although O.N.E. are quite tasty, they are also a little pricey. The freshness and quality of these fresh juices"
"This is a pretty good quality and tasting organic walnuts.  Of course because it is organic it is like twice the price of other walnuts.  Still not sure if the organic nuts vs. non-organic nuts will really make a big difference or not to our health?  The only real dissapointment was that you get much more ""pieces"" than you get ""halves"".  This is the key thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars. TL;DR Pretty good quality walnuts and not a lot to complain about.

"Somehow a fruitcake called Trappist Abby sounded ""pure"" to me so<br />I didn't check ingredients - mia culpa. After attempting to<br />read them, I at least recognized ""high fructose corn syrup"" The<br />disappointing taste of this fruitcake led me to consider the contents so,<br />finding them less than pure, I pitched it. TL;DR Unreadable ingredients - PLUS - High Fructose Corn Syrup, Un-Filled <br />Ingredients:<br />- Fructose"
"I was really looking forward to this salt substitute but it falls far short in my opinion. Tastes like a glorified version of Mrs. Dash and far from salt flavor. If you want something really good try Himalayan Pink Salt sold through Amazon --- it's outstanding!!!! I purchased the one with the grinder and it could not be better. Yum, real salt but good for you. TL;DR It's just another form of Mrs. Dash and is a great substitute for your regular salt. You just can't beat that"
"This is another one of our favorite Kernel Seasons flavor.  The BBQ and Nacho Cheddar are the other favorites.<br /><br />It's good to mix things up a bit and have different flavors on hand, because you certainly can get sick of eating the same flavor over and over, especially if you eat popcorn almost every night like we do!<br /><br />These six packs at Amazon are the best deals, but you may want to order a single pack of various flavors to try out and keep up with them all.

We love Crystal Light drinks and we drink them all the time.  In the summer we drink a lot of iced tea but we also watch our caffeine intake.

I was previously using the N-Bone Puppy Teething rings but these are smaller and less expensive. My puppy can chew through one of the small ones in about 15 minutes but it is made to be eaten.  It keeps him busy for a few minutes, which is nice.  I would reccomend these to keep their attention for the next 2 years, or even longer.

I had forgotten that I ordered these. I went to check the mail (in Alabama in July) and couldn't figure out for the life of me why I started smelling vanilla from 20 feet away from the mailbox. Obviously once I held the package in my hand I remembered. I used most of these beans to make my own vanilla extract (which was amazingly easy and SO worth it). I have also used them a little in baking and to make some vanilla bean ice cream. Every use I have found makes me want them to be in the refrigerator in case I want them to get
"I first tried the double chocolate brownie cookies before they improved them, and they would've earned more like a 3 or 4 star rating.  I decided to give them another try after I noticed the new packaging proclaiming ""Now even tastier!""  They are beyond delicious.  You don't have to go looking for flavor - it's right there.  It's a great treat for anyone, let alone those of us cutting out or cutting back on gluten.  They're the right density, consistency and texture you can use for breakfast.  They taste great!

"The rub of course is for a comparably sized florist boquet you will spend close to $100 delivered.<br /> This company will have the flowers delivered for $35. So thats why I gave them 5*'s, the price. No the flowers arent hand delivered in a pretty vase, they come in a box and the person has to arrange them.<br /> But the flowers I gave were very fresh, the packaging was excellent and came with a cold pack to keep them warm during the winter.<br /> They are the only one in the world"
"Heard of them through a family member. My order was shipped and received in less than a week after it was placed. Fast, efficient and will continue to use and recommend them to other people who miss our PR coffee! Thanks! TL;DR Excellent service!

"I tried integrating this into my German Shepherd puppy's food.  He is currently on California Natural Lamb and Rice puppy formula, but I have a hard time finding it - so I thought I would switch to this Royal Canin.  He loved it.  But then he started getting diarrhea.  The diarrhea may have been from something he ate in the yard and not the Royal Canin.  Regardless, I donated the Royal Canin to a dog shelter.  This is after I read reviews of his dog's food and they said this puppy was the best one they could"
I got these treats for my two cats who are not really that picky.  They seemed to like them and begged for more like usual.  They are pretty firm for a semimoist treat.  They almost look wax like but the cats chows them down with pleasure.  I have ordered them more than once from Amazon already. TL;DR My cats liked them.<|endoftext|>The New York Times recently published a story about how the Obama administration was pushing
"I drink a lot of cappucino, so I decided to try this drink. It is only vaguely reminiscent of real cappucino. That said, it was rather tasty, a nice light drink.

The same food sat for a week, so I dumped it and opened a new bag, thinking something had happened to that bag. They all looked great and the food was good. It was the first food we"

I was disappointed.<br /><br />The drink looks strange - olive green with translucent, slightly darker green bits floating in it (the thick opaque label hides this fact at first glance). But I was okay with that. One swig, though, and I felt like I was going to fall asleep. I was also curious to see how well this would"

"This is a great creamer, it is hard finding Irish Creamer in our hometown and my husband loves this stuff. The only problem I had was when the box arrived, one of the creamers was smushed open and the creamers weren't in a bag just the box so I had the wonderful task of washing each little creamer and finding the culprit in a soggy box. I highly recommend using this creamer, it has a true Irish Cream taste without the alcohol. The price is also good and this creamer is great.

"I had to laugh at the product description. Those are the words to describe certain chocolates, not a water! Still, as a bit of a water taste snob, this is indeed great tasting water. We have well water that is absolutely vile to drink. I've found that there are great taste differences in bottled water, be it spring or filtered. I usually choose spring waters, but this product brings up the point that it can be produced anywhere, thus leaving a smaller carbon footprint.<ref>http://food.thedailybeast.com/article/"

These are not the same in the least. These are made with what they call Biscuits. This is made with what they call ""Biscuits of the Week"""
"According to the manufacture the xylitol used in this gum is produced in the USA from birch, not GMO corn from China. This gum has a pleasant taste it is not too strong or over powering. Xyloburst, like most xylitol gum does not have long lasting flavor, but it does last long enough and it does not get rock hard once the flavor is gone so you can chew it for a while.

You cannot tell the difference between these gluten free items and durum wheat pastas for texture, flavor (as a full blown celiac I really appreciate products that resemble, are as good as, what I used to eat before I was diagnosed). You can reheat without the decomposition that happens with quinoa pastas. Leftovers freeze well and reheat well in either oven or microwave.

"I don't normally drink strong coffee, so this variety was good for me. Good flavor, but not too strong or bitter. The only down side is that several k-cups (probably 6 or 7 out of the first 2/3 of the box) failed and left an excessive amount of grounds in the brewed coffee. If not for that, it would be 4 stars.<br /><br />At the price I paid ($27.75) it is a pretty good value as well. <br />The flavor is not overpowering or anything like that. The"

I love that Honey Maid came out with convenient packaging. I am a huge graham cracker fan and now I can just grab them on the go. You get just enough in the package to fill your snacking urge without having too much or too little. I love how they stay fresh longer since you get 6 smaller packs within the box. This is a great snack for you on the go or for your children at school. I highly recommend these convenient fresh stacks if you like graham crackers. I would highly recommend these for kids or for a snack or just to keep

"These biscuits go very well with the PG Tips tea I ordered, and they even taste good on their own. Normally I'm not big on this kind of biscuits - they're either too sweet or too bland - but these have a mildly sweet taste that's surprisingly addictive.<br /><br />I'm not happy with the packaging though. In the pack of 7, only 3 turned out perfect, 2 were slightly crumbled, and half of the last 2 were badly smashed. TL;DR Very bad quality. This is a very bad thing for us. I don't know"

"Yes, the first ingredient is meat, but do not be fooled. The following ingredients include multiple soy ingredients to make up most all the protein content.

TL;DR excellent packaging, excellent quality for making homemade dishwasher detergent and lemonade powder, and very good value for money. I highly recommend it.

"We have several of these machines at work and I've tried lots of different flavors and blends...this is one of the few I can keep down without my body convulsing with an involuntary shudder.

"If I was just judging these as gluten-free chocolate chip cookies I'd give them no more than 3 stars, but going against other mixes they are easy to make (even by children), and are relatively inexpensive, making them a 4 star product as long as people aren't comparing them to homemade.  They are slightly gritty from the rice flour and they don't hold together exceptionally well, plus they fall apart the next day.  But they do well when eaten partially frozen and actually make a decent breakfast.

"The beans are good quality and the coffee is tasty.  The flavoring is a little light and often leaves you guessing as to which flavor you are supposed to be drinking.

Not an amateur coffee drinker  I order 20 lbs. per month and frequent several area cafes. TL;DR great cup of java, good beans but could use just a tad more flavoring and maybe a bit more coffee."

"In this, my 4th year of home brewing, I have decided that crushing grains and watching thermometers was just to much. I drink 5 gallons of beer in about 2 weeks so the trouble of grain brewing was not worth the time.<br />I use this extract along with dextrose and hops to bend the beers flavor to my will.Very good base if you like a darker beer and the added hops can give you an IPA flavor without the multigrain,multihopped mess that comes with maltiness.

If you are a tea-drinker I would definitely suggest you check out this tea, the subtle aroma of rose, but not heavily perfumed taste, is very uplifting. TL;DR Great value with great taste.

"Not too long ago, our daughter arrived at our house after a year away from home with bags full of clothes that were full of moths. To this day, she rejects that notion that she brought such a scourge to our family home, but the facts speak for themselves.

The day after she landed and unceremoniously dumped her bags in the front hall closet, I opened the door to that same closet. We had no moth to go into the back room, so we were all"

"I'll leave others to comment on the taste, but since someone mentioned the lack of trans fat, I just want to point out this is NOT a healthy drink, in case anyone thinks it is, because it's mostly sugar. I don't want to get too deep into nutritional debates but you can find out on your own. The bottom line is, added sugar, in any form, is very bad, even you're managing calories perfectly.

One reason is there's a photograph of a dog on the front, and that dog looks really startled.

"I was skeptical when I tried this, but boy what a delight.  The flavor is deep but not too heavy, and the carbonation is just right; it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the juice.  It actually has a good ""mouth-feel"" - I drank it 15 minutes ago, and I can still feel a little hint of it.  It's like I had a thin slice of fresh kiwi and strawberry melting in my mouth. TL;DR Unbelievably strong, refreshing, and very tasty.  I'm not sure it"
"Other reviews said the packaging was inadequate, broken or not air tight.  That was not my experience.  Arrived in good condition (I checked every bottle for a proper seal).  The sauce is very good compared to store brands and the price is reasonable considering the quality. TL;DR Packaging is fine for a bottle.

Other than occasional pimples, my only skip issue was wrinkles beginning to appear (I'm only 22 so either I don't drink enough water or I'm way too stressed for my age).  Though the deeper wrinkles have not completely disappeared, they are definitely diminished and barely noticeable unless you're very close to my forehead.  Love this so far! (And it smells wonderful!)

My 13 month old son loves these!  He thinks they taste great and they are less messy than all the other biscuts that are out there.

You will have quite a few left un popped.<br />Add melted butter and sea salt, not bad.<br />If you do want to add more of these, just add some more corn syrup"

"I first started buying these when they only had three or four flavors. Now they've expanded their flavors and I like the new assortment, especially the blueberry and strawberry flavors. All the flavors are yummy. There isn't one that we don't like. Also, the ingredient list is more specific than it used to be. No corn syrup, which is the main reason I purchase these.

Vegan. Natural. Crisp breads are a very traditional food in Scandinavia. Rye is the most traditional flavor. The rye flavor in this crisp is very mild.

"These cashews are excellent and have just enough salt. In general, most prepared foods have too much salt. Most Americans exceed their daily salt intake by two or three times the FDA suggested intake. Finally you have a lower sodium dry roasted nut that is fresh, roasted to perfection and reasonably priced. If you want more salt, lightly coat the nuts with some olive oil and break out your salt shaker. TL;DR Roasted and salted to perfection.

And, although, I'm NOT an avid coffee drinker, I'd recommend this blend to individuals who aren't familiar with non-commercially, monopolizing brands.

Black beans are pretty versatile; they can be used hot or cold in various dishes. These beans are firm not squishy nor<br />overpoweringly flavored. For less than 15 bucks a 12 pack they're a decent deal. I didn't give them 5 stars due to the discrepancy between posted and actual nutritional details.<br /><br />This information is very important to some customers. To reduce the salt somewhat be sure to rinse the beans in cold water and drain them. This also helps to keep the beans dry and the water soft. If you don't want to

I've always been more a fan of red wine in general and the traditional Lambrusco red is a staple at our house...but I fell in love with this the first time I sipped it...it is slightly sweet but not overpoweringly sweet...goes wondeful with just about anything. If you like Lambrusco red you should definately try White Lambrusco. TL;DR white lambrusco is the best wine that I've ever sipped...it is a bit more
"Gustaf's rainbow candy laces are the best I've ever found.<br />They have very tasty distinct flavors, and the texture is perfect, not<br />too hard or soft, but just right! And because of their shoelace length they<br />are excellent for edible projects for kids to use for activites such as macrame, braiding or<br />knot tying practice. They can be frozen to keep their freshness and defrost without losing any quality.<br />I'm also really happy with these. They have a really nice"
"Have plenty of water handy.  The over-the-top taste of sea salt and cracked pepper nearly overcame all the cashew flavor.  The Emerald almonds were much more enjoyable because they were more subtlely flavored. TL;DR heavy seasonings get your attention, don't forget it. I'm not going to go over everything I've"
"Delicious. I have a smoothie every morning I use a little of this with my fresh fruit and veggies. It tastes so good on a warm sunny day. Very good product. Would recomment to anyone and will buy again. The mixed berry is the best. TL;DR Very good product.

I put this flavorfull goodness on 86.42% of the food I eat at home and when I go out I find myself cra cra cra cravinggggg this stop to put on a big mac per say of the likes of chiles nachoooos.

"If you are a fan of specialty smoked salmon or prefer to select your fish at a seafood counter you may not care for Bear & Wolf.  This is almost right off the hook good.  It has that ""fishy"" taste that I actually prefer, but if you serve this up to those who don't care for it you'll be getting a thumbs down.  If you've tried the Kirkland brand, which is delightfully pink and flaky, you might be taken aback when you try it out.  This may seem like the opposite of what you might expect"
I bought these olive oil packets for backpacking. They generally are perfect for back country food to avoid the mess and weight of a bottle of olive oil. The down side is the packaging needs work. Five packets out of the 105 were empty. They had not leaked but were simply factory defects. Then after I had sorted through the whole box to see how many were like this the next day I found one of the packets had sprung a leak and made a mess over half the packets which made it very difficult to get out of the bag (the other half were filled and not leaking

"Thank you for carrying this product. My husband and I used to go to Chi-Chi's Restaurant many years ago before<br />they closed in Bowling Green, Ky. The Cancun Seafood Enchilada and Sweet Corn Cakes were our favorite.

"In short, this stuff is pretty fantastic! I've been vegan for 5 years for reference. No, it's not anything like your Kraft Mac n' Cheese, but it has a great, savory flavor nonetheless. Do NOT buy this if you're expecting something that mimics cheddar. You'll especially like the flavor if you cook with nutritional yeast, go for it!<br /><br />The pasta cooks nicely, its whole wheat macaroni that takes a little longer to cook than it would in your typical pasta dish. The only problem with it is that"

"Two little Yorkies basically love these little chicken wrapped biscuits.  Each morning each one gets 2 of them and they start the process of enjoying them.  Then after a few minutes they finish with a nice little mess.  I do not understand but near the end of the process they either just get tired of eating them or do not like them or they are suggesting that they want to share the leftovers with us.  Regardless, we always have a few pieces on the floor that have to be shared.  It is important to share them as much as possible. I have"
"These couldn't be easier.  You pour one packet into a bowl, add 2 cups of cold water, and microwave for 3-4 minutes.  They are already flavored, although I did add butter to mine as I didn't initially anticipate that they would be flavorful on their own.<br /><br />They have a bit of a sour bite which implies that there is some sour cream in the seasoning (I didn't bother to check).  It's not overbearing, but my first impression was that this was a little too sweet.  I'm not an advocate"
"I recieved this in timely manner. Was packed good. The taste is very good,if you taste it at all. No smoking if gets a little too hot. I liked the smaller bottles,so does'nt get old before using all of it.<br />Thanks TL;DR Tasty, if you're looking to try a new style or you want a little extra"
"These bowls are so yummy!  My son loves them.  However, they picture on the front does not accurately depict what is inside.  The inside is much more ""saucy"" and has very small bits of protein, grain, and veggie.  Therefore, I don't think a young tot could self-feed with efficiency.

"I've always loved Chick O Stick. It is not the product that rates low. It is the price. Don't buy this product from this vendor, unless you like paying twice the price for the product. At.25 per piece (price is on each piece) at box of 24 should have only cost $6. This product was twice that amount. There are others that sell it for the correct unit price. Fool me, you just got an additional 6 bucks. I'll pay better attention to the price.

Both of these met the requirement of being ""C.E.T chews"" but they looked (and sounded from the description) very different from each other, so I wasn't sure what kind to buy. Based on the reviews for each, it still wasn't the cheapest chew I'd ordered yet, and there was no mention of H"
"The product itself is great, it's the bag that needs work.  I recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag, spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about 90 seconds.  You do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you. I really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty. TL;DR great product, bad design. If you like them and want a cheaper alternative then buy one of the above"

"I love chocolate in all forms, including good chocolate cereal.  So I had high hopes for this cereal.  Unfortunately, it just was not that tasty to me.  It has a slight artificial taste, especially after the first few bites.  The artificial taste faded a bit as I continued to eat, but I still felt that for a chocolate cereal, it just didn't taste that chocolatey.  There are much better chocolate cereals out there.  This cereal seems to be trying to make a comeback from its past."

"Reminder - 3 stars means ""it's okay"".  That being said, the most important question is how does it taste?  It definitely tastes like chocolate, that's for sure.  Each piece is a lightweight crunchy pillow much like Captain Crunch, filled with a tiny drop of chocolaty syrup. The pieces are very lighweight, mostly air, so a bowl of this cereal isn't very filling.<br /><br />Each box of cereal is only 11 ounces, so if you're in the middle of an entire day with a few kids,"

I love this product and you can't beat the price.<br />Trying to find gluten free products that taste<br />good and don't cost a fortune is a real problem.<br />I've tried all of the Mary's crackers and my favorites<br />are the original and the pepper. TL;DR Crazy for Mary's crackers. They taste<br />good.<br />They're not as thick as
"This product was recommended by a doctor because it does not have the not-so-good-for-you ingredients of regular sugar-free gum.  Have only been able to find it at a couple of stores like Whole Foods and Wegman's.  Usually they are out of stock.  So much more convenient to purchase on Amazon and have it shipped to my door.  And at a better price! TL;DR SPRY GUM purchased at Amazon.com was a ""good deal"" for $2.50 and shipped to my door"
"This is so good I had to restrain myself from eating the entire cooked contents myself! Simple to make! Cooks quickly! A hardy fast healthy meal that everyone loved!<br /><br />This is my first time trying this product, but I will buy it again...and again and again and again!<br /><br />I will be trying other items under this brand name. I would suspect they are just as good. TL;DR AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it so much!

"This is the most uique way to make a statement at your special event, we used the large flowers for the adult champagne toast and the small flowers for the kids shirley temple drinks.  We also had the bartender at the venue ""Hyatt"" create a signature drink for the bride/groom. This was the talk of the party, all the guests wanted to know where we found and bought them.  This will be a nice presentation at a bridal shower.  I can only hope that they can get the wedding in order so we can get a great"
"These bottles are very tiny, but man, do they pack quite the taste!!  This is the very best white truffle oil I've ever had!  It's pricey for it's size but you won't regret it.

"Far better than the aggressively mundane flavor of the Peanut Butter and Banana `monkey bar', these Strawberry Vanilla bars at least have a pleasant and refreshing flavor.  The lightness of the flavor is delicate but I will admit that it isn't anything special.  I am still left a little iffy on these bars.  The frosted coating on the underbelly is nice and sweet, and the nuttiness of the bar itself has more depth than a standard health bar, that can come in a variety of flavors. The chocolate and the banana taste really nice and smooth"
"These are fabulous!  Just enough salt, plenty of crunch.  I will be ordering more because the kids love them.  I plan to try some of their other products as well. TL;DR Excellent! Great for kids and kids' friends!!!

My mom loves this."
"Not only is this product good for adding nice flavors for cooking, but My wife also uses it as a face and body moisturizer. She says that it is much better than any lotion or cream and you can also use it as a leave-in hair conditioner. And Amazon's price makes it affordable. TL;DR Nice for cooking, but pricey if you are a beginner.

"I really like hot chocolate all year round but find that drinking more than one cup is just not a good idea in hot weather.  I had to literally force myself to drink the entire cup. The white chocolate, as well as the regular chocolate, had a funky taste to it. At first I just thought I was something about the white chocolate, since I don't usually drink white chocolate, but then the next day I tried the regular and the same taste was there.  I have made tea, cookies and even a couple of sandwiches.

"Well I liked the idea of the noodles. I took seasoning from an oodles of noodles packet and put it on the Shirataki noodles. Still way to much sodium there, but I was just testing them out. They were just ok. I could tell they weren't real noodles. It was a texture thing. I haven't given up on them though. I still plan on trying some of the recipes out from the web site. I also plan to try some of my own recipes out there on Pinterest. I'm just starting to get used to my noodle dishes"

"It's a great soy protein powder.  Very pure, and very tasteless, so you can seriously add it to anything.  I throw a tablespoon in practically everything--cereals, spaghetti sauce, etc.  It's a nice thickening agent as well.<br /><br />It will clump if you simply toss it into a glass of cold liquid, so either have a blender handy, or deal with lumps.  Protein's protein, IMO--I can deal with it, though--but not much more.

"Overall, this was a decent price for the volume of biodegradable poop bags...the only problem was that each bag in 1 entire roll (orange)did not have an opening on 1 side (i.e. both ends were closed). Defective. Also, these bags are hard to open in the cold as we can't figure out where the opening is each time & it doesn't initially open easily when rubbed together to find the opening. Overall, ok for the cost (although, this was not my best bag) but I would have bought another bag for this"
"I don't like dark chocolate but I can't live without these. They were sent to me by a friend as a gift and I was not sure what to think. Now, I am buying them for myself. The tangy pomegranate covered in dark chocolate was the perfect mix of yummy! TL;DR Yummy! I'm so sorry to hear this.

"I really wanted to like this toy. If it didn't have small batteries and brittle plastic inside the mouse I would probably give it two stars, as I can still use the string and the thing that goes over the top of the door with some less dangerous toy tied to it. But at this point I'm watching my cat closely, hoping he didn't swallow one of the batteries or some of the other parts that caused the mouse to squeak so realistically. TL;DR My cat tore the squeaking thing to pieces. This is a good toy.

"Since the absurd boycott of Danish products in the Middle East over cartoons, it is good for the west and freedom to support Denmark.

"I met the local distributor (Shawn) while he was delivering product to our neighborhood store, and I've been buying it since.  I know that I will never put down the soda or energy drinks, so I figured that I may as well drink one that is good for me.  I've actually lost 10 lbs by substituting soda and monster energy for this drink.  I have no illusion that this is a magical cure all drink, but all the ingredients are natural, all the calories are in the sugar, and the flavor is good.  I'm very happy"

"I was very sad when I found out this was discontinued, it's my favorite popcorn! After much trial and error I found a way to replicate the flavor pretty well. Take a bag of the powdered cheese sauce mix out of a box of Annie's macaroni and cheese and mix it with around 6 Tbsp oil and stir. Pour over hot popcorn and voila!

"As a serious chocoholic, I have to say that this is the best cocoa powder I have tasted.  Amazon sells some others which are very good, even excellent, but for my hot cocoa addiction, this brand is absolutely the best, with a very distinct but balanced and satisfying flavor.  I would recommend this one for any chocolate afficionado. TL;DR My favorite cocoa powder, at least when it comes to hot cocoa. 

Review:"
I've ordered this tea about 3 times before and will order it again.  I first had this tea at a Chinese restaurant and can only find it online.  I don't like black tea and not a fan of green tea so this oolong tea is just right.  I don't make it really strong so I steep it for about 3 1/2 minutes and it's good to drink. TL;DR Repeat buy at your convenience and make sure it doesn't break. This tea was so good
This is what I grab at night when I need a treat or when I'm on the run. It is about as good as it gets in flavor and wholesome ingredients.I would recommend this to all vegetarian and vegans. TL;DR Good and chewy. If you are looking for a treat or just want a quick snack I would
"The Sparkling ICE line up are all extremely addicting, this one included. I love that they are all flavorful, calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, caffeine free), and carbonated. I used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband's cokes and always hated myself for giving in. I always thought it was the sugar I was craving until I tried these a year ago and realized that it's actually the carbonation I would crave. These are a guilt-free, low-calorie, carb-rich cokes, and they are delicious"
"i was very skeptical having tried other gluten free pastas in the past (rice, quinoa...).<br />this stuff tastes great! i think i actually prefer it to the regular wheat pasta.<br />i cooked it a little longer than directed - tasted it after recommended 8 minutes didn't feel it was done, so i kept cooking it and tasting every 2 minutes until it was perfect. added some pasta sauce w/ spinach & broccoli and feta cheese. my picky 5 year old son loves this.<br /><br />so good!<br />"

"This is hands down the best honey I have ever put in my mouth. In fact, it's so good that I give it annually for Christmas gifts. Watch out, though - this will spoil you for that stuff sold in the bear-shaped bottles! There is simply no comparison between this and the product carried in grocery stores. Because it's expensive, I don't cook with it. But I love it on toast or muffins, in tea, or anywhere that the honey flavor really comes through. I can't imagine how you could not love this honey.

"These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.

I noticed some inconsistency in wetness/dryness between different colors; the purple and pink don't work as well as the others in the bag.  Don't know if it's characteristic of the color or inconsistent product quality.  Would definitely purchase again. TL;DR Great for cake pops!

"This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh.<br /><br />Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!!

The recipe on the box makes the best cookies! Our three sons and their families always look forward to eating them. We have used this product for at least 44 years (we just celebrated our anniversary last month).  Too bad our local supermarkets stopped stocking this mincemeat product!  They only carry the moist mincemeat in a jar.  Some people just don't know what they're missing!! TL;DR Cookies! This recipe is perfect for those that want to make them more of a snack!
"What a great purchase.  I was originally looking for the ice coffee k-cups but they are ridiculously expensive (I feel).  After reading that their is not much of a difference and I was most concerned of the ""watered down"" taste so I thought and ""extra bold"" strength would do the trick, which it did!!!!

There are better teas available, but they can cost many times more. TL;DR The best thing about this tea is the price.  I am so glad I bought this"

The ""open here"" slot makes it easy to rip the end of the pouch open without having to use your teeth, but the hole that results is a little small for the tea to pass through easily, which means you got to work it through for a couple seconds, causing a little powdery mist to form outside of your drink.

Nothing wrong with product as Planters nuts are always a favorite. But the box arrived with one flap pulled up and after counting the packages inside I discovered that it was one short of the salted peanuts (should be 12). Because of the limitations of contacting Amazon about problems - you must repackage item and return everything - I am keeping the item because it is part of a care package for my Marine nephew in Afghanistan. I am just so disappointed that someone was so hungry they had to steal from their food. I hope the product has been worth the effort. If you have

The item itself is in a squeeze pack and that does not work very well with peanut butter. The instructions say to knead the individual package before opening... whatever that means?

"This is good loose leaf tea and the packaging makes this tea a very good purchase. There are three packages so while using one the other two stay fresh, the package has a zip lock thing to help preserve freshness and the bottome is fasioned so that it can stand up like in the picture. The tea itself is very good, but you must remember that this is Jasmine green tea... All in all I am happy with the purchase. TL;DR Good tea.

The olives are big, yummy, perfectly brined, not too salty queen olives in a smooth, dry vermouth that yes - gave me a bit of a buzz even before I mixed it with gin to create a tasty martini.

"I have used this seasoning for grilled veggies, soups, stir fry, cole slaw, etc. for several years and it is THE BEST. I haven't been able to find it in the local stores recently, so that is why I ordered it from Amazon.  It's called Salt-Free 17 because it jazzes up the dish so you don't have to use salt and pepper. It is also great added to melted butter and served on a saucer for dipping bread. All in all, it tastes great, and is very inexpensive."

I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.

This means that they don't take the carbohydrates into account and will just eat more. "

The cat thought it was OK and did chew on it occasionally but he didn't seem overly impressed.  Unfortunately, this product attracts gnat like bugs within the first 10-14 days.  It is messy to clean out and reseed plus wasteful to spend $4 every few weeks and I've used this product several times.  It was only about $2"

"I came to Amazon looking for a good deal on Craisins in bulk.  I had been putting Craisins in the granola mix I make.  When I saw these cranberries were from my home state, I had to try them.  Glad I did.  So much plumper/jucier than the Craisins.  Since I use these in granola, the sugar content is fine.  I wouldn't eat them alone, as they are very sweet.  I've tried them as a snack for breakfast and as an evening snack."

I tried this for the first time today and I enjoyed it. It had a mild but bold enough flavor for me that I could drink it in the am and have an afternoon cup  when feeling sluggish.

This product is the best one that I have found for safety and actually works. Most anti-perspirants on the market contain dimethicone which is a very dangerous chemical to the body.

"Wish these came in a smaller size for my dogs (English Cockers).  Yep they can eat them but they almost make a full meal.  I just started breaking them into 1/2 cookie and now they are a better size but could still be smaller.  High quality big cookie! TL;DR Big really Big and Big and Great Size for my cats

"PB2 is great.  A serving, 2 T of powder, is 1 point on Weight Watcher's Points Plus system.  Mixed with a tablespoon of water it makes something like peanut butter.  But even better is adding it to soups or smoothies for that peanut taste. TL;DR PB2 - Peanut Protein Powder - 1/2 tsp - 1-1/2 tbsp - 1/2"
"You can walk through the spice bazaar, through the streets and past the storefronts amidst the crowd and crush of Istanbul's market bazaar, until, near the Bosporus you come to the Mehmet Efendi window and smell the sweet scent of Turkey's greatest coffee.<br />What Illy is to Italy, Mehmet Efendi is to Turkey, and let's remember-the Turks started it! Oh, what sweet scents, what delicious varieties. I always bring home my favorite Turkey, the one with the best flavor. It's the best Turkey"
"Having recently expanded my tea horizons here lately, I stumbled into toasted rice tea (by another organic company) that I positively fell head over heels in love with and concluded that I can't live the rest of my life without. In addition, the other tea I can't do without is green matcha. So, imagine my surprise when Amazon was selling this little beauty that is a mix of BOTH green matcha and toasted rice. So, I just HAD to give it a try and see what happens.

This morning I decided to give this to"

"You really can't go wrong with Britt coffee.  I had it for the first while traveling in Costa Rica and fell in love with it. I stuffed my luggage full of it!  I was thrilled to find out I could order it through Amazon.  Britt has spoiled my taste buds for anything else.  I highly recommend this coffee. TL;DR Great Coffee!

I love it. It tastes great and I will be back for more"
"Great product.  This snack does not have a blah flavor, but actually taste like popcorn.  Put a little calorie free butter spray, diet cheese,low fat cream cheese, or even a deli type lunch meat on it and you have the perfect low calorie snack that is better for you than the candy bar you grab most of the time.  Great addition to any diet to save calories and loose wieght. TL;DR real foods organic corn thins and tastes good. "

"I purchased this specifically for using in my coffee, which I happen to like with a lot of cream & a lot of sugar (figuratively.)  I've been using Splenda for several years with great results and decided to give Stevia liquid a try considering there's just not enough information about whether sucralose (Splenda) is potentially harmful for you or not.  All I can say is YUCK!  Disgusting!!!  If you only use a little, you can be a lot more effective than I am with my Stevia.  This is"
"Worked better than the stuff a vet gave us for a problem that the dog chewed his skin off. This created a large bloody wound. The stuff we got from the vet required re-application daily but did not work all that well. This stuff was applied a couple of times at first and now once a week or 2 and all is well. TL;DR Better than Vet Care

This was my second time trying Vet Care. It was very effective"
"These cookies are delicious.  In our neck of the woods, they only have the giant Mallomars, so I really like the smaller size of these.  Everyone in our family loves them.  Not the cookies' fault, but these were mostly smashed to smithereens when we received them.  The box looked fine, but the cookies were broken and messy.  Luckily, I got them for us, not for someone else because I wouldn't have known they were all broken because I was so excited for these.

I had a few questions. I"

"I am not a salt person - I'm on high blood pressure meds, yes, but have never been a big fan of salt except on french fries and onion rings (which I allow myself only infrequently) anyway.  It's hard to find good quality nuts of any kind that are unsalted.  These are first quality AND unsalted.  I eat them out of the can when I can't resist, but I mostly use them in stir-fry concoctions (the bottled ones are usually too salty for my taste). I don't use them because I"
"My cats give this their approval.  It actually smells like human grade tuna, better than most cat grade tunas.  The package doesn't say, so I still wouldn't eat it, but it is definitely higher quality.  My cat that doesn't eat a lot of her food scarfed this down and immediately started eating the other cats serving.<br /><br />This is a treat.  It doesn't have all the nutrition cats need (it is like feeding your cat human tuna). The packaging is a nice and small package, but it's still a treat"
"These crackers are great with cheese, with soup or with salad. They are a substantial cracker that will hold the press of your knife to spread butter or soft cheese.  I am never without these and the black sesame variety of this brand as they are also gluten free. My guests rave about the nutty flavor and want to know where I get these crackers. TL;DR Great Crunchy and Delicious Crackers

Easy to use no mess, what's not to like.  If you have coffee maker that uses k-cups you have to try these, it puts you back in control of drinking the kind of coffee you like. TL;DR Disposakups are great for those that want to get their k cups out of their cupboards and into"
"I've been craving this flavor during my pregnancy, so I was very excited to see these crisps on here for such a great price!  I ordered two sets of six (12 total packets) and they arrived within a week.  They were well packaged and protected for shipping, so the actual crisps were not broken into dust.  My only complaint was the price of the shipping - I think I would order them again if it weren't for the extra cost. TL;DR Excellent product with a great price for what it is - I would definitely order more of them"
"The product was fine--they are good enough diced tomatoes, but when they arrived they were so dented that we could only use about three of the cans. I don't think we'll buy canned goods from Amazon again. TL;DR very poor shipping, poor quality, and a lot of wasted money.

I'm glad"
"It's true that these don't taste like fresh ones you bake yourself.  But when is a pre-packaged food ever the same as fresh?  These are an awesome alternative to potato chips.  I share them with a couple friends at work and they rarely last more than 1 day.  They are very tasty and addictive.  Just make sure you have a mirror handy or don't smile until you get to a rest room. TL;DR Delicious! The only problem I have with these is that they don't taste so good,"
"Plochman's mustard is great.  One of the best stone ground mustards I have tasted. TL;DR plochman mustard is great and has great flavor.

"This salt is very very'salty' with a somewhat bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />There are better products (search for South African East Coast sea salt).<br /><br />I much prefer Maldon's, which is hardly gourmet. TL;DR Not impressed<br /><br />They have a bit too many flavors.<br />"
"I have been using this for almost a year. Water gets boring and hard to drink, this is a great way to help you drink more. I really like this berry flavor. Keep in mind, small amount goes a long way, I use 1/2 a dropper full to flavor 32 oz of water. I also have the toffee for coffee. TL;DR Great way to get more water!

I've been using this for about a year now. Water gets boring"

"When I originally reviewed the 12-pack of these, they were 30% more expensive than elsewhere, but now, via subscription, this is a better price than I can get at any store.  They are as fresh or fresher than those bought in stores, and each unit of four six-bar packages is sealed in heavy-duty plastic.  Delivery is prompt as well.  I agree with the ""Leading consumer magazine"" that rated these to be the best of all granola bars I had ever tried.  It is not that I don't like granola"

"I love orange coffee and it is simply becoming impossible to get anymore.  I have been in withdrawl for years and a friend found this on Amazon, so I paid my money and took me chances and was very pleasantly surprised.  The smell is terrific while brewing and the smell takes me back to the days when the kids were first born and working every spare minute on a fixer-upper.  The taste is even better!  I am actually writing this review as I am purchasing another 5-6 cups of orange juice, but this time I will not be buying this"

I particularly like the Calming and Chamomile teas, and he likes the Bedtime - it really relaxes him and helps him fall asleep.

I agree that some of the teas have a unique taste because of the herbs, but I think most of them are just good enough to give you the right kind"

"This is by far the best bread product for celiacs if you can have cheese.<br />Any kind of cheese makes this mix tasty.  As someone who doesn't like to cook, I am thrilled with the ten minute prep time and 25 minute baking time.  My house smells fabulous, I get fresh bread, and hello sandwiches!!!  Something I love and hadn't had in over two years as I have MANY other food allergies, including yeast and rice, so all other celiacs I try are delicious.

The amazon shipping was acceptable, but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment, unless they were to put ""This side up"" on the box.

"This great instant expresso is truly sensational & in a class by itself!! What makes this so special is not only the fabulous taste, but its powdered form, making it versatile for baking, making truffles, chocolates, and is easily blended in iced coffee beverages. I have tried many other instant expresso coffees and the others are mostly freeze dried, so the taste is not as good & it does not blend well in iced coffees or as versatile for baking or truffles. I have not used it in any other espresso machines, so I"
"I don't know who's in charge of watching out for mislabeled products, but I was very annoyed after searching amazon for ""flushable cat litter"" and ordering the first thing on the list, just to find out it's not flushable. Not only is it not flushable, it's about the least flushable cat litter I've ever seen. My cats hate it, and refuse to use it. One of my cat is running around frantically crying because he doesn't know whats happening. I'm sure it's because his cat has a very bad asthma."
"These are great to have!  I toss one in my daughter's lunch...have a few in my purse for a ""pick"" me up, etc.  Tasty, tasty!  Other people are so curious when I whip one out.

"If I have a sore throat and starting to feel a little achy, I reach for a hot cup of the Dry Desert Lime.  I don't know if the effect is purely in my head, but it seems to make me feel quite a bit better.  There have been several days where drinking this allowed me to feel well enough to stay at work rather than go home and take a sick day.<br />The taste is unique, and the smell is amazing.  A single packet of this lime will not make a bad difference in my life, but it does make"

"Its nice being able to get rye flour overseas. And the size is right as well as the price. I only use a little less than a cup of this to make three loaves of sourdough bread about twice a week, so it lasts me a while, but I'll have it gone and ordered another pack by the time the sixth month comes, so it will remain reasonably fresh. Don't know what else to say about flour, it works and tastes great. I'll give it a shot if it's good and not too thick and the texture is good, but"

"With a legendary name like Gevalia, I was disappointed to find that the coffee contains artificial flavors.  The outside packaging looks gourmet and epicurean, with gold lettering.  Unfortunately, artificial flavoring also plainly occupies the front face.<br /><br />The aroma from the coffee is quite pleasant, however, after brewing, the coffee itself is nothing to write home about.  In fact, it tasted rather bitter.<br /><br />I would not buy this item if I didn't like the taste of the coffee.<br /><br />"

It's been about a 1-1/2 years since my first review of the Big Chew and I'm happy to report that it is still going strong with our dog.

It came shipped as a bag inside a Cooper's cardboard box inside an Amazon shipping box. However, the inner Cooper's box had been opened (it had been previously taped, and I cannot imagine why Cooper's wouldn't have taped it before they were done. I don't have a good"

I like Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter but the struggle with mixing it in the jar was annoying.

"I really really like this cereal because it's very filling and doesn't have added sugars like most cereals on the market.  I love how it is very nutrient dense and holds me over for hours.  It is somewhat bland with a nice hint of cinnamon, but I don't like things that are overly sweet.  I just wish it came in a larger package and wasn't so expensive.  I have about 1/4 to 1/2 cup with each serving, but it didn't take a lot to get my hands on this cereal for me.  I would"

"We're heavy K cup users at our house, and always look forward to trying new types. I was excited to see this one listed, and ordered right away.  Wow! What a disappointment! When I opened the box, there was loose coffee all over the place, and the lids look like someone sat in front of their tv and glued them on by hand. So ok, I could probably have lived with that, but when I brewed it, it was terrible--nothing like any of my favorites. I would never drink this again. I'm not complaining about it"

The Crystal Light powder is hard to mix in the right quantity and diet drinks are heavy to carry in and expensive if I get them from the vending machine.<br /><br />This compact little bottle is perfect for bringing to work and mixing with our cold filtered water.

I stopped the diet coke and took up green tea.

I ordered it on amazon when I got back, and it came quickly and carefully wrapped. The flavor is light and slightly sweet, sort of crisp (I'm terrible about describing taste!). Is it pricey? Yes. But is it worth it? I think so :) TL;DR Light and sweet - a great coffee. I would definitely buy again.

"Don't buy this food if you are looking for the primary ingredient to be meat.  The ingredients list on the product page on Amazon says ""Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Meal, Ocean Fish Meal"" before any grains are listed.  This is wrong.

TL;DR Great for a milder roast. Not a great blend but definitely worth a try.<"

I love this honey and I never thought that I would go through so much.  I eat it on everything and I also love that it doubles as a first aid antiseptic.

"I compared this to the Creole seasoned nuts from Peanut Shop of Williamsburg (also called ""Mardi Gras"" flavor nuts), and the Williamsburg nuts have a much tastier seasoning. These nuts are good nuts and roasted well, but I don't find the seasoning appetizing. There's a lot of herbal flavor, possibly oregano and bay leaf, which overpower the onion and garlic flavors. There's very little heat. It's not unlike the flavors in a gumbo, but it's not as spicy as the other flavors in the nuts, so it"
"It's hard to order anything on the internet and be confident enough that you got a good product, let alone a great food product. Initially, I ordered this popcorn because of it's great price and relevance to what I needed, and ended up really enjoying it for the taste!

"This was my first time cooking with a Prima Taste kit and was impressed by the full flavor when making curry.  I opted to use shrimp since I didn't have beef on hand and it still came out very delicious.  The flavors are complex and remind me of Thai and Malay foods I've eaten at restaurants.  For those who don't like spicy foods, this does pack quite a punch but not too over the top.  Only slight negatives - there are a bunch of little leaves on the bottom but this is the perfect balance of spices and flavors."

"I purchased this package of 3, 16oz cans from Amazon.com. While the pancakes/waffles are definitely edible, they aren't my favorite. I followed the package instructions on the preparation required, added the ingredients (egg, milk, butter, and of course the mix), yet found that the strawberries did not taste as good as if you were to add them fresh, some were a little hard too (I did allow the batter to set for 10 minutes as the instructions state), and overall my strawberries were not good.

So here is what to do:

"Overall, the pizza turned out well.  I found that their 10 minute cook time would be accurate for a normal cheese pizza, but I loaded mine with tons of toppings so it took me nearly 20 minutes.  The crust came out great.  The sauce was pretty interesting too; slightly cinnamon flavored and sweet in my opinion.  Overall, for six bucks a pizza and prime shipping, you can't go wrong.  I will be ordering again in the future. TL;DR Pretty Good, but not as good.

Good pizza, great delivery.

"I have tried a variety of ways to bake with this flour.  All breads come out dense, but that is the same with many flour alternatives.  But, outside of that, this is less tasty than using potato flakes and grinding them to a powder.  And, my potato flake bread came out fluffier than my potato flour bread as well.<br /><br />But, this is easier to deal with, and for time consuming tasks, it is worthwhile. TL;DR: You could substitute this with potato flakes for flour but that would take a"

My first exposure to these chips was at a local gourmet deli.  I hestitated to purchase them due to the price ($3.25 for a 2 oz bag) but I bought them anyway.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!

This is a MUST HAVE for all the geeks out there. The only

"We have four dogs ranging in size from medium to large.  All four of our furry friends love Nylabones!  Our largest dog has some stomach issues and our vet recommended Nylabones as a chewy toy/treat that our Golden's tummy could handle.  She loves them and they haven't caused her any tummy troubles.  These are regular stocking stuffers for our pooches. TL;DR Awesome chewy treat that will make your dog's tummy grow!

"I love Lapsang Souchong tea, which is hard to find in retail stores. The online choices are Twinning or this Taylors of Harrogate. I won't pretend to make a ""connoisseur's"" analysis of their relative merits; to me they both taste delicious, even though I do believe this (Taylors of Harrogate) tea to have a more pronounced taste (perhaps -- see below -- because there's more tea per cup???).

"For anyone who has ever tried ginger beer, this product really packs a punch! It reminded me of ginger beer from the islands - it has that authentic, smooth, ginger burn that you expect from real ginger beer. Totally none alcoholic and thankfully not a soda. Much more refreshing with the right amount of ginger bite. There is actual ginger floating at the bottom of the bottle so you have to shake it up before you drink the beverage...outstanding! I love the 6.8 oz glass bottles- I can't say this much more because I am a big fan of ginger."
"Some mint teas are overwhelming but Stash's Morocan Mint is just mildly minty. It is made with spearmint, lemongrass, peppermint and green tea. I don't really taste anything too lemony. This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey.

"I'm not sure that this gum improved my well-being or any of those other sorts of claims, but it was tasty and pleasant to chew, which is pretty much all I ask of my chewing gum anyway.  This gum has a good peppermint flavor, though not too strong.  I don't really taste the ginger, but I suspect that's what tempers the peppermint.  The texture is quite soft; softer, I'd say, than other chewing gums, which I think is a little odd given this gum's tendency for a lot of chewing gum"

However, I found the candy to be on the oil-rich side as apposed to creamy.  One or two and you don't really object.  I bought these on sale and would not have bought them at the suggested retail.  For what I paid, I am pleased enough. TL;DR Very fancy and delicious candy.  I will be buying again! I'm a chocolate lover"
A neighbor made this soup mix for us and brought it over.  She added pre-made chicken and a bag of frozen vegetables.  It was the best chicken noodle soup we have ever had. She said it was easy to make and such a nice gift for us! TL;DR Great Soup Mix!

"I bought a box of this tea at my local Whole Foods.  If you have never tried this tea, I recommend buying one box, like I did, rather than buying it in bulk here on Amazon.  I am not pregnant, but I heard this tea had good benefits for all women of reproductive age (I'm in my late 20's).  So I made a large cup of this tea and went on with my day.  Within two hours of ingesting the tea, I had a huge increase in my blood pressure and heart rate.  So it was time"
"I purchased this in a B&M store but wanted to add a review on amazon for this tea.  It's excellent.  Wonderful tea flavor, great black tea flavor, it's not overly fruity or very sweet, it has just the right balance of a fruit/black tea.  The tea pyramids never lose their shape.  It's great iced.  It has real pieces of fruit and big tea leaves inside the pyramids.  Definitely one of the best teas in this package, it is just not the same as some of my others"
"And by haunt you, I mean in the form of vomit all over the place. Though my dog, a 150lb. Newfoundland, absolutely loved the bone but even after just a few minutes chewing it, he had managed to gnaw off some bone slivers and swallowed them. Shortly after that he was throwing up, not just the bone slivers, but everything he had eaten for what seemed like days. So, while it seemed great to give him a treat that he loved so thoroughly, the bone had taken on a darker meaning to him.

"I know it may sound strange, but I use a tablespoon of this almond meal mixed with water as a facial cleanser and mask, and ever since the first use of this paste, the quality of my skin has HUGELY improved. I honestly wish I had pictures to share, because my acne has been reduced in half within a single month. I have tried literally hundreds of different skin care products and homemade remedies, and this is definitely a thoroughly effective mild exfoliant, cleanser, and moisturizer. It does have a nice consistency, but it's just not as"
I tried this product only because I couldn't get the one I'm used to and found it to be harder to use in my baking since I was making cookies.  It probably is better for cakes. TL;DR Pretty good baking powder. I have a very small amount of baking soda in my freezer and I

So, I've spent a long time trying to find the right snack and I have finally found the best granola bar ever! Kashi's bars do not taste like cardboard and their texture is so much better than any other health/protein bar I've ever tried. The flavors are fantastic and I'm officially addicted to them, especially the chocolate & peanut bar. My only regret is the price. I'm sure you can find a great"
"...in that it's chewy, beefy, and has a long shelf life. Jack Link's Peppered jerky is a tad too peppery for my liking, so I expected the teriyaki flavor to be just as robust. Instead, it is mild. Still really good, however! One word of caution, although it's addictive, eat in moderation, or your sodium levels will be off the chart. TL;DR Has most of what you want in a Jerky...and not too much!

"I need to eat 1 or 2 protein bars every day as a post bariatric surgery patient to ensure that I get enough protein every day. This double-chocolate Special K protein bar (10g protein, 180 cal), is my very favorite protein bar, since it tastes more like a chocolate candy bar with crunch. I've been eating 4-5 per week for over a year and I still don't get tired of them. There may be bars with more protein, or ones with more fiber, that I have been missing out on for the last year. I know some"

I have given her Pedigree for years and she will eat it sometimes, but she doesn't seem to enjoy it.  I was actually shocked by the way she went at Beneful the first time I gave it to her. The bag is more than halfway gone and she still seems to really enjoy it. I guess she has chosen to switch to Purina Beneful because her taste buds are still quite sour.  I don't know if"

"I absolutely love this granola! It is both delicious and healthy. With 33 grams of Whole Grains, 4 grams of fiber, and 5 grams of protein in each 1/2 cup serving, it packs a nutritional powerhouse with a fantastic flavor! I like it best after a workout with a 1/2 cup of milk and banana chopped up in it. I can't wait to try the other flavors. I'm sure they will be equally as delicious! TL;DR Best Granola! I've found I love it!

"I bought three boxes of this. The first package I made, the cupcakes fell in the center and I followed the directions exactly. I chalked it up to a fluke and a few months later made another box. They didn't fall this time, but the consistency was just not right...crunchy. I threw the third box away and won't buy again. Keep in mind, I usually make things from scratch and am an experienced baker so I don't think the error was on my part, but if you're making something for me that I can do without"
"This spice is great. I found that it not only makes my rotisserie chicken taste wonderfull it also works on pork ribs. I made chicken and dumplings the other day and added some of this spice and it made it taste great.

I can't taste anything but the pepper when I eat them, and they're so salty that I'm thirsty afterwards.  This is a terrible product, and the company needs to seriously scale back their seasonings.

"Reading some of the other reviews here, I do not agree with some of them calling these bars ""dry"". Maybe they got a bad batch? Though not overly moist, I did not find them dry at all. They were especialy good with a cup of coffee. They have a different taste, but not a weird one. The cocoa  is the main thing you will notice, but the walnuts and raisins come through as well. The makers of this bar seemed to have a bad idea of how to use this, so I am not sure why I"
"At 6.8 ounces this drink size is a tad on the small size. It's a very thin coffee drink that to me is ""just okay"". At about $2 each it also seems a tad on the expensive side. The flavor is good, so it's worth a try to see if it ""hits the spot"" for you. TL;DR Quick coffee drink with lots of caffeine.

I couldn't eat a lot at a time, but for a decadent snack, these are perfect. My kids loved them, too. If you like soft, chewy cookies and chocolate, you won't be disappointed in the Chips Ahoy!

"The Crispy Brown Rice Cereal with Mixed Berries isn't too bad!  I would say it is pretty similar to regular (non-gluten free) Rice Krispies in that it gets soggy in milk pretty quickly but, it is pretty yummy as long as you eat it right after you add the milk.  I made ""rice krispy treats"" with them & they were good.  The berries added a little something extra to it.  Even people who are lactophiles would not be able to get this.

"The flavour and smell is very strong, unlike any other seeds I've tried. I would describe the smell/taste as a spicy, maybe a little acidic. I don't know where the spiciness comes from, it is really strong and really unlike anything I've ever had. I would not describe the taste as earthy, earthy tasting to me is like a tea that tastes like leaves, but it is possible that this flavor is earthy to others. If you are using many plants, I would recommend using the same method as for the leaves. The leaves"

I use Vegeta when making soups, stews, Chicken or Veal Marsala or Piccata.  Vegeta can be used to season rice or pasta.  Since it is made from vegetables, I have used it to enrich the flavor of vegetarian Thanksgiving'stuffing'.  Vegeta can also be used to enhance sauces and gravies.

Trying to describe this tea is kind of like trying to describe Coca-Cola to someone that has never had it. There are definitely flavors of cocoa and nutmeg, but this isn't like drinking watered down cocoa.

"I ordered this coffee and since it was tagged as for K-Cup brewers, I assumed it would be designed like a regular K-Cup packet, but it is not. It will fit in and work in a Keurig, but because of its design, it lets a small amount of sediment through while brewing, which is not pleasing when you get to the last few sips of coffee. Also, this coffee has a bitter taste, so I definitely will not buy this product again.

So far, only one or two leaves dropped, and that leaves are all black. The bonsai is so beautiful. I have been"
"We not only loved this mix as a pizza crust, but it has become our favorite gf dough for other recipes.  We cut the dough for donuts and fried them, then coated them with powdered sugar or cinnamon- best ever!  And the dough fried and then salted with mustard was the perfect replacement for my mall pretzels.  With garlic and butter, these were the best breadsticks.  I subscribed to 2 cases per month! TL;DR Not just for pizza crust but all of our other pies, too. Thank you so much.

Also the directions are to add 1 `squeeze' of this vitamin packed liquid to 8 oz of water or other beverage.

"I'm buying a second of these boxes, as we've added another cat to our family.  My 11-year-old son is in charge of keeping the boxes clean, and this box makes it easy for him.  As other reviewers have said, the clumps do tend to get stuck in the sifter, and it can be messy to dispose of the waste.  However, after some experimentation, we have found the solution to both problems.  First, store the sifter in the same bag as the cat. If a dog has been with you for a"

There is a definitely cocoa flavor...more of a dark chocolate/straight cocoa than your traditional chocolate/milk chocolate.

Instructions on bottle say each squeeze adds more flavor, one squeeze for each 8 ounces. So what is a squeeze?  Each person's squeeze is different.  I thought it might be a measured squeeze, so I squeezed it. Well I guess that was too much, it definitely was too sweet with over powering.  My first thought was it was a sweetener, not a sweetener"
"Yes, the tortillas were tasty, but the product is cross-contaminated with gluten.  The labeling is very deceiving!  It says: ""corn, a gluten free food"" on the label, but they blew it by using dirty equipment. TL;DR not gluten free, they use ""corn, a gluten-free food"" on the label,"

We have spent 3 or 4 times as much for bags of less quality.  This tea has excellent flavor and aroma, perfect for a good, strong cup of tea.  I've also noticed that this tea brews much quicker than other brands. TL;DR Truly delicious and easy to make. "
"For some reason Aero Bars are difficult to find in the US, but they are gaining traction. While some people say the bubbles dull the chocolate taste or that they have a difficult time with the texture, I tell them to try one of the flavored aero bars and not to expect a typical Nestle chocolate bar. They are  also softer to chew and bite into-which makes them better for some people that have a hard time biting into hard chocolate bars.<br /><br />The mint chocolate has a very sweet finish which I believe will appeal to some people who are looking"
"I've fallen in love with other Earnest Eats Food Bars so I was excited to try out this flavor.  However, I was kind of disappointed - the taste is okay but not for me.

The preparation was easier than I anticipated: I didn't need to filter out the leaves, as they managed to stay in the bottom of my cup.

"Tea arrived on time and is being enjoyed. That's about all I can say about it for now anyway. OK? TL;DR Good tea for the price.

I love this tea. I love the aroma."
"I wasn't completely sure what to expect from this product, but thought it would be good for a trip to the beach or quick snack at the park.  I was very pleasantly surprised by what is in these 6 really tiny looking boxes.  The salmon actually tasted like fresh fish, with a creamy texture, which was put on  ""ritz"" like, flavorful crackers. They were pretty filling.  Also included were a bag of edamame and one of dried fruit, both a nice touch for me.  I am really looking forward to getting a full sized version"
"I really like this apple cider, but I find it a bit too sweet if I make it on the middle (8-10oz) brew setting. If it's made on the highest setting it's better, but of course the taste is slightly weaker. It does have good flavor, without a lot of cinnamon.  Compared to the other brands I've tried, this one is the best, and my fave for the fall. TL;DR Yummy but a tad too sweet.

This was a pretty good tasting cider with lots of cinnamon and a"
"I was so sad when I opened the first can.  It did not taste well to me or my friends.  We are thinking either the garlic is too much or it is the fire roasted taste.  My friends advised me to send my cans back, I decided to donate them to a food pantry.  Hopefully someone else will like them more than me. TL;DR Too much garlic!

I was trying to save this bag for when I ran out of the big bag I already have.

I tried it out, and it was delicious. It has a very"

There are a lot of limited ingredient and Hypoallergenic foods out there (well not a LOT, but at least options), but good look finding limited ingredient treats for cats.

Super coffee that make having a Senseo finally worth while. Great customer service as well. The best seller of pods! TL;DR The best seller of pods for my personal tastes! Thanks again!
"I'd been hearing about Zevia and finally got to try some of each flavor.  Due to an inability to process sugar (can't ""cheat"" because I get instantly sick), and headache problems from aspartame and sucralose, I've been unable to drink soda for several years.  I figured I'd rather be healthy, feel good, and drink water or tea than have a drink of pop and feel awful, so I abstained.<br /><br />So I've tried all of Zevia, and this isn't even the worst one"

"Product arrived in an envelope within a week, and all seemed good. Upon opening the envelope what fell out was alarming. The square Jaffacakes box had apparently been opened by somebody with a knife on one end, and the orange packaging inside of the box that contained the cookies was a smear of chocolate and crumbled cookie matter. Not sure if I want to try to consume something that has obviously been tampered with to some degree. Too bad because I was really looking forward to trying these.

I'm sure the packaging and the packaging was very nice, but the"
"With the advent of the internet, it's very easy to get your hands on salt water taffy without having to be near a coastal city, state fair, or theme park.  While there's no substitution for freshly made taffy, the next best thing is purchase a souvenir box of salt water taffy, and the Fralinger's brand sets the standard for all boxed taffy.<br /><br />Two important things to know about taffy, outside the packaging and in the product: It's not a real taffy,"

"I like that this bag is well sealed on all sides. The double ziplock is easy to close. I also like that there is lots of room above the level of liquid because I like to squeeze the air out before I seal the bags.  The only drawback is that they don't stand well once I put the liquid inside, they tend to flop over with 4oz or more of liquid.  Which may not be a concern if you place the filled bags in a box, container, or container with a watertight lid. I did a little research on the"
"This product is very good.  The 1.5-ounce jars are perfect portions for cooking or individual servings. I rated it 4 because 5 jars leaked and I had to get rid of them. TL;DR anchovies are great! If you want more, you can buy these from the store."
"I love Chai Tea, so when my husband bought me a Keurig for Christmas, he also bought a box of this stuff.  I'm grateful that he also bought some coffees, because this Chai is terrible.  The spices are overwhelming, and upon my initial tasting, I thought my cup must still have some dish soap in it.  I poured that cup out and started over, but with no better results. I finally realized the strange taste was probably due to the sucralose, but I can't really say because my taste is still a bit"
I used to have to go to Costco to find this item.  Now I can buy it online for just about the same price.  Plus I don't need someone with a membership to let me into the store.<br />I eat this for breakfast every day and prefer it over the instant oatmeal since it's less processed and seems to satiate me for longer. TL;DR Great value!<br /><br />
"These looked so good, but the sugar free product is very laxative, so eating more than one can be a mistake.  I can't recommend them, and I don't plan to buy more. TL;DR Not good. Not good, I've been using them for a month now!

"I love this product...BUT, all of the 5 out of 6 bottles ordered oozed out onto my cupboard shelf AFTER they arrived.  I got a refund for the no-beef that arrived all oozed out, but the no-chicken seals looked good.  I went to use a new one and they ALL oozed out!  I threw them all in the garbage!  The product actually pushed the jar lid up.  It's a shame because the product is fantastic but, the packaging does not have enough information so you are left with a bunch"

"These are wonderful chips that really do taste like what they say, olives! If you like a very crispy thin chip packed with wonderful olivey goodness and subtle garlic then try these they are awsome! I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty, but not overpowering. I am not sure I am getting the full"
"These pill pocket treats are a life saver!  My cat was recently diagnosed with chronic renal failure and now has to take 8 medications twice a day. These pill pockets make it super easy to give him his tablet medications. We stick two of the medications in a treat in the morning and again at night. Two little tablets fit in each pocket.

I was surprised by the fast delivery! It was estimated that it would take about a week but it came within three days.<br />I'm pretty satisfied with the product for now but that's because I just received it.

"A beach on Ko Samui. A bikini-clad waitress brings you a coconut, then produces a machete. ""Pour vous, monsieur,"" she says, bringing the blade down upon the coconut with a raunchy thwack that strangely excites you. Why did she speak French? You don't care. She unwraps a straw, and places it gingerly into the coconut. ""Merci,"" you say, confused. You didn't order a coconut. You don't know what she meant. ""I don't think you know"
"Love this product! I substituted the butter for coconut butter--definitely not a mistake. So delicious. Adding Pamela's Dark Chocolate Frosting Mix (also using coconut butter instead of butter) makes this entire cake so delectable. It is definitely pricey online, but if your neighborhood grocery store will order it for you it goes for $4.50-$6.00. Its worth the cost though. TL;DR Yum yum! The Dark Chocolate Frosting Mix is the perfect dessert mix for any cake lover!"
"I love the Coconut Cocoa tea, so I was excited to try this one, even though it was listed at about four dollars more than I paid for the other.  This was a nice cup of tea, but despite brewing/steeping at directed, I don't get any chocolate flavor from it.  I'll drink it, but won't be buying another can, especially at $10.69. TL;DR Nice cup of tea, but not worth the price. I think it tastes good, but the chocolate flavor is off and the coffee"

Fortunatly, I am able to purchase my dark roast and decaf on Amazon through automated shipping. Once a month I get my delicous dark roast and every 3 months I get my decaf.

"This oil is certainly tasty, and the teeny tiny little bottles that it comes in are very cute.  Since this was the first truffle oil that I have ever purchased, I was surprised to see that this ""truffle oil"" is really just olive oil with ""truffle infusion"", whatever that is.  There are a couple of almost microscopic truffle flakes in the bottle, but other than that, it's pretty much just plain ol' olive oil with a little extra taste.  I really hope that this doesn't make you want to go out and"
I recently bought an El Paso Chile Co. margarita machine and also wanted to lose a little weight!!  Did a search for sugar free mix and found Baja Bob's.  I've gone through about 20 packages of the powder margarita mix and love it.  It is a touch tart but I tone it down with a lite diet Sprite and it makes a perfect margarita everytime! You won't be disappointed.  I have had regular (sugar) mix and it does taste great!  The margarine is great and I've had
"This one is extremely versatile as for flavor differences, the liquid you add can be either water, tea, or milk.  But the flavor is really mild no matter which blend you use, which is why the middle-grade for the product itself.  If you want a real snap to the mango you'd get a better one at a certain fast food chain that advertises mango-strawberry. TL;DR Versatile, high quality, and easy to follow.

"The refrigerator cake made with these wafers, which my mother called ""Famous Dessert"" when she made it at the end of the 1930's, is what my kids renamed ""Favorite Dessert"" and it's now that for the grandkids too.  The delicate wafers themselves are dry and crisp.  Their taste seems nothing too special if you eat them straight -- but being layered and covered with whipped cream and a few hours in the refrigerator brings about an easy transformation into a dessert.

"I purchased this product for my daughter with multiple food allergies.  The ingredients listed were all things she could have.  Unfortunately, the ingredients list is inaccurate.  I checked both amazon's list and the ingredients list on the company website.  Neither listed citric acid, which can be a corn derivative, but it was listed on the box when I received it.  Corn is one of my daughter's allergens, so I could not feed her this product without knowing the source of the corn.  She also needs a water source to get some water out of the"

As it turns out, there is some debate regarding the very first ingredient, raspberry leaf.

I got a heavy plastic smell and shockingly intense bitter taste, even after 10 cycles after buying it new.<br /><br />At first the reviews I read seemed good and the product is so cute I wanted to like it very much, and the idea of making your own food seems healthier than buying prepackaged food or making a lot of food in a single place.

"It's just a can of corn.  For online pricing, this is a good deal.<br /><br />What I like about Libby's corn is that it's not quite as salty as some of the competitors.  That makes it easier to cook, because it doesn't overpower other ingredients.  Put a small amount of butter or cream in when you heat it, top with fresh cracked pepper, and it's a tasty side.<br /><br />The product is very consistent.

The flavor is also more consistent from lot to lot than Rio (Rio can be great and it can be awful). The pieces about the size of a lifesaver so I'm not sure of it's consistency.

The single cup coffee maker works well as advertized and makes great coffee.

I tried several other flavors before I found two that agreed with my taste buds - almond & coconut and nut delight. TL;DR Stays better than most other flavors I've tried in a cold room.

"These have a nice pea flavor and are tasty.  However, I can't see how these are much better for you than potato chips (the only difference is really a pea vs. a potato, as they have about the same amount of fat.)  They claim they are baked but they are very oily.  Eating a serving or two of steamed peas would be a much healthier, and perhaps tastier, way of snacking. TL;DR Tasty, but not really a recipe, but not sure about the health benefits.

This product is cheaper than in stores or other brands.  The flavor is tangy.  I use it in all of my cheese replacements and soups for nutrition and a tangy chicken flavor replacement. TL;DR Vegan Chicken or Cheese flavor replacement - I'm not sure what it's good at.  But for those

"This a wonderful, smoky salt. You can smell how smoky it is when you open the package. It has a finer texture than some other salts, and seems saltier as well. I don't eat meat, but I imagine it would be wonderful on hearty, savory meat dishes like beef and bar-b-que. I love it on cooked greens, and grilled veggies, especially portabello mushrooms. Adds alot of flavor to boring popcorn, too. A good purchase, and will definitely make it an addition to the list of things I love about this seasoning"

He has tried most of the products out there relying heavily on Head & Shoulders as his go-to shampoo of choice. According to my 16-year-old, he much prefers this shampoo for the following reasons. First, the scent is not overpowering. It's a clean-smelling fragrance that lasts throughout the day. Secondly, it doesn't tingle when applied.

"I sometimes use these for baking, but more often just enjoy eating a square right out of the bag.  If your recipe calls for chopped candied/crystallized ginger you will need to cut these into smaller pieces.  I use a slap chopper, and it works well, but it will get really gummy if you are trying to chop a large quantity.  The baking chips are much easier to use, but you will also get a little added sugar if you go the other route.

When he first arrived here in the states there were very few companies importing at least from a retail product standpoint many of the things he missed. If you have never had ""pickle"" with very nice cheese and artisan bread you can not even begin to image what you are missing. TL;DR A little bit of England in a jar, some cheese on top, some bread, some cheese on top of the cheese"
"Deep, rich flavor.  Great price when you use the subscribe and save option considering it is organic and fair trade.  While the big bag is kind of clunky, I'm glad the company is willing to reduce waste by using larger packages.  It's easy enough for me to transfer to glass, ceramic or metal food storage bins. TL;DR good coffee, good price, great selection

Excellent product, but not as good as other coffee brands"
"I'm using these with my 10-week old Siberian Husky and she'll do just about anything for me if I have one in my hand. TL;DR My dog loves these, I'm not sure if she likes them enough. I think the biggest problem"
"Disappointing. My Wife and I picked this up hoping to sample a variety of coffee with our new Keurig, and find the flavors we liked. Nearly half of my 34-count sampler consisted of 2 flavors - spiced egg nog, and pumpkin spice. To make matters worse, both taste very similar. Not exactly the flavors you are looking for in June, either.<br /><br />The only good thing to come out of this mess is that it introduced me to the flavors we had never heard of before, so we were pretty excited about"
"I really did not like these potatoes at all. I thought they tasted worse than most of the others I've tried. I have to admit that I am a fan of whole potatoes, but I like to keep a box of potato flakes on hand. My husband likes dried potatoes, but he did not like these. TL;DR dried potatoes do not taste as bad as whole potatoes, so I would never eat them in"
"This is a really good cereal, though admittedly if you're used to Rice Krispies, it will not be the same.  My kids, all picky, like this cereal.  The recipe for peanut butter crispy treats on the box is awesome!  No one misses Rice Krispies in our house! TL;DR Very Good, but not a lot of good stuff.

I am very disappointed in these K cups.  I made it using the smallest cup size and it still tastes like hot water.  I guess if I added cream and sugar it would taste like sweet creamy hot water.  I am mad that I bought the 50 pack and it is not returnable.  They are going in the trash. TL;DR FLAVORLESS.

ALL the kids LOVED it, and most had eaten before which was good. They were a big hit! TL;DR YUM! They're great for party night. I recommend this product to anyone who's looking"
"This stuff is surprisingly good. A lightly carbonated fruit drink, it's got a tangy-sweet flavor that's really unique. The cans themselves are awfully small, but the taste is truly big. It's made from 100% juice with no added sugar, corn syrup, or artifical sweeteners, yet plenty sweet enough naturally for most people's taste I'd think. My 12-year-old son loves it too. A terrific, natural drink. Ingredients include apple, grape, kiwi, cherry and apple cider vinegar, plus the sugar and corn syrup."

"This tea is wonderful. I drink it every morning, and occasionally in the evenings as well. The strawberry essence is noticeable in aroma, but much more subtle in taste, and it pairs nicely with creamer. I would say they greatest shortcoming here is in Iced Tea. If you are an avid iced tea drinking you might with to try a different blend, as without the heat, the subtle strawberry flavor and scents tend to be nearly unnoticeable. It has a rich, dark, herbal note and I'm sure it would make a good addition to an "
"I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more likely to get too dry, so I have used this to my advantage.

"`No Fear, Super Energy' is a big claim when there are so many energy drinks out there.  For about less than three bucks a can, it competitive in price, but I have to be honest.  The taste was bad.  It was like a chemical peach flavor without much fizz.  I am sensitive to caffeine and Taurine, but really did not feel much of a boost.  If you like your vitamins, there is plenty of Vitamin C, B6 and E.  I did not like the taste of any of the other energy drinks"

"I like my coffee strong without tasting burnt. This stuff is exactly that. I use a french press and this stuff grinds wonderfully without having a lot of coffee dust. I was afraid when I took that first sip and was instantly blown away by the easy-on-the-tongue flavor. I'm not caffeine sensitive considering I take Excedrin every day, but I can definitely feel the jolt with this! TL;DR Wow, this is a great deal. I've never tried caffeine, so you don"

This popcorn doesn't pop well. If I add 2x to 3x the oil and a lot of extra popcorn to the pan I get a full pot. Even then it takes forever to start popping and leaves a bunch of burnt kernels. As soon as I use up this order I'm switching back to the organic brand from my local co-op. It costs a little more but that's made up for with everything actually popping. TL;DR Doesn't Pop Well: The only time I've ever used this recipe was when I was cooking with

It's ideal for cats who need a limited ingredient diet but whose owners are not willing to prepare a home made diet. All canned food contains thickeners such as guar gum or carrageenan which can also be allergens.

Hot water, a couple of minutes in the microwave, and it's ready.  The lemongrass flavor is pronounced but not overpowering, the chili flavor is more muted.  Heat lovers will want to have some Sriracha, Mongolian fire oil or another Asian hot seasoning to make this soup a little more savory.  The lemongr"
"These are very tasty cookies.  Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as peanut.  I was so happy when I finally tried this recipe.

I grew up eating these and introduced them to my very picky five year old.  She absolutely loves them.  We moved last year and I haven't been able to find them in a store - so when I found them on Amazon I was thrilled.  I ordered them about six weeks ago (12 cans) and already need to reorder.

"This is, by far, my favorite tea, and the only one I always drink without any flavorings.  When I found its ingredients promote lower blood pressure, I decided to restore it to my daily regimen.  Local stores, however, were either overpriced, or out of stock.  Amazon's product comes at a lower than local price, and, of course, with the Amazon rep for superior customer service.<br /><br />This last is a significant factor.  When a product is available, people tend to purchase it more, and they are more likely"

I have five cats so getting all of them to like a food can be difficult. I give them wetfood as a weekly treat and this is the only type they all love and devour! They all love the gravy and two in particular mostly just lick the gravy so this is more food for my buck! TL;DR excellent choice!
"I use this when I run out of milk for my coffee and tea, as well as adding to gravy or some baked goods. It dissolves rapidly and doesn't make lumps (Organic Valley nonfat PM requires whipping or shaking vigorously). I like that it is made in Holland as I think the EU has healthier rules regarding animal husbandry and resultant quality. Also this is the ONLY full cream powdered product brand I have found. Yes, it's a bit pricey and yes I wish it were made with cream, but this is a great option for any dairy-free,"

I was not put off by the slightly odd color or the slight grit of this powder as neither were too bad in my opinion.  The taste is not too bad either - not great but okay.

That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store.

"This is my favorite hot cereal. Cook as directed but let if sit for about 10 minutes before eating. They do not bill this as a 'diet' food but read the label, you will be surprised. This is wonderfully healthy! I just love, love, love this cereal! TL;DR Yum!!

"this is, by far, the best tea mix!  it's made with splenda rather than aspartame and it's much  more natural & lighter tasting than any crystal light.  when i run out i get cranky so i'm very happy that i can order it from amazon and have it auto-shipped regularly and at a discounted rate. TL;DR my favorite tea mix is not tea with splenda. If you're looking for a tea with spl"
"Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.<br /><br />This is soft food in the petite cans favored by the feline haute cuisine products. However, the similarity seems to end there as the product is flaked rather than sliced or fried. We also have a few other items that are less common on the market"
"YUMMY!!! Arctic Zero is delicious & has great nutritional stats.  Even though I never thought I'd eat the entire pint in 1 sitting, I did, but at least I didn't feel tooooo guilty.  I've tried the Choc & Choc PB.  Now I'm going to order the Vanilla.  Still on the fence about the Strawberry Banana.  Only negative is the price, but if you consider the 6 containers you get for $46, that's a little too much.

While our unit takes a 6 oz bag we find we can use either the four ounce or 8 ounce bags just as well. The lid always lets the excess popped corn fall out of the popper when we use the larger eight ounce bag. In this case we had the 6 ounce. The corn popped well with only a few unpopped grains remaining. The butter and sugar did not have any effect in this case.

"This is a great coffee if you like the taste of a dark robust brew. I like it myself, but my wife says it's a touch on the strong side. I've cut back on the amount of coffee I use for our brew cycle. The taste is satisfying and is not bitter at all.  If you like a dark Colombian, give it a try.

"Thanks to Roland for adding a very small amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to these sliced button mushrooms grown in China.  Vitamin C not only helps to preserve the freshness of these mushrooms but also blocks the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines, which tend to always form in all salted foods.  Scientific studies from China have good news for mushroom lovers:  [Please click ""Comment""] TL;DR Roland adds a pinch of ascorbic acid to the sliced button mushrooms. The vitamin C also prevents nitrosamines, and"
"I love that this is high protein, high fiber, low carb. Great nutritional content, and much cheaper than the grocery store. I have purchased this pack of 6 twice. I would give the first order 5 stars, but I give this order 2 stars. The reason: the second order was well within the expiration date, but has a musty smell. It tastes ok, but even after being cooked still has a musty smell. I will probably order again, but maybe try a different seller.

I am a big fan of the ""low carb"" stuff."
"We use it mainly for frying up chicken strips and sometimes mushrooms.  We were buying it one box at a time from Martin's or Krogers, so I figured why not go the ""pallet"" route and buy a whole carton.  Best decision I ever made in my entire life, not like some horrible decisions I've made, including buying 25,000 shares of Facebook on opening day.  My wife is made at me about that, but I don't care. TL;DR; This is one big, big, big, big, big, big"
"My husband and I are big coffee drinkers, at least between the two of us we have 80 years' experience.  We drink many different brands and typically prefer flavored coffees.  I tried Luzianne based upon my experience with this brand for other food products, the other reviews, and because Amazon ran it at a pretty good price, $5.28 per pound, including the super saver shipping.  The first thing after brewing the coffee this morning, I asked my husband what was wrong and his response was ""The coffee tastes like water, I think you"

They say only the packaging has changed, but I had an old package and compared the ingredients and they are DEFINITELY different. It is still a Good way to give a pill, but not as healthy or tasty. I have even found unknown pieces of hard stuff in some, (I use to use them as a ""toy"") that I have to take out. So"

Unlike some other meals, in simi;ar pachages, this is fully cooked,and ready eat in just 60 seconds!<br /><br />I became aware of this product at a ""craft service"" table on a television shoot that went in to the wee hours - it is really good!

"I was recently given the opportunity to try Izze Sparkling Grapefruit Juice, and I am very glad I did!  With none of the added sugars contained in similar products, Izze relies on its own taste to draw the consumer in, and the addition of the sparkling water enhances the flavor rather nicely.  If you are a consumer who enjoys all natural flavor with a little pizzazz to it, then Izze is definitely the product for you! TL;DR A thoroughly enjoyable product! I highly recommend this to those looking for something new and different, and will"
"A 1000 count order lasts me a year and it's my second time purchasing it.  Not only is it convenient but I can't get over the savings.  When I see this product offered in the store in smaller sizes at expensive prices, I just smile and keep on walking!  Thanks amazon.com! I decided to see if the shipper really sent me 1,0000 packets (who would be crazy enough to count them, right?) and I'm happy to report all 1000 are back, but I still need to go back and see if the seller sent me"

"This is distinctly different than Gran Riserva!  While this is good balsamic vinegar, it is not great.  We had previously purchased Fattoria Estense's Gran Riserva in the short squat bottle (same # of oz)and it was amazing.  This vinegar is much sharper and thinner.  It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva.  The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no.

"I was given the 3-pack by a friend of mine and I have to say that this person is definitely my best friend for life. I should begin by stating that I LOVE chicken wings - I try them everytime I see them on a menu. Since trying these rubs, however, especially the Finger Lickin', I just can't bring myself to try them any place else.  The rub is perfectly spicy, perfectly smoky and leaves you craving more. We grill up these bad boys at home for about 3 hours, then we put on our favorite BBQ sauce"
These are the best pretzels.  I can't believe they are gluten-free and taste great.  Our family actually like them better than regular pretzels. TL;DR Absolutely Great!  And I'm not a fan of gluten-free pretzels.

"Plain TVP, without flavoring or other ingredients added, really doesn't vary so much between brands. It's always going to be on the mushier side if you try to, say, make a burger with TVP alone. And it's going to absorb the flavor of whatever broth, seasonings or other foods you're cooking it with.<br /><br />I try to keep this product on-hand because it's a quick, easy and inexpensive way to keep protein around.

"There was a weird after taste. I found that 1/4 of a good vanilla extract and 1-2 table spoons of powder sugar work a lot better. For the liquid I use almond milk or soy milk. If you use a flavored milk you might want to go light on the sugar. TL;DR ok but not great

I just recently started buying this food for my 2 cats and I must say they really seem to enjoy it.  Even the chihuahua has been enjoying it much to the cats chagrin.

There's no particular flavor to them - just sweet chewy strips covered in sour crystals.<br /><br />The only downsides to the product are common to all sour strips in general: they leave citric acid crystals everywhere, they get hard if left out in the fridge for too long - which is just one of many reasons why I've"
If you like the taste of Bergamot the Stash's Premium Double Bergamot is smooth and delightful tasting. My first order occurred as a mistake as I meant to order Stash's Earl Grey and didn't note the Double Bergamot listing.

"Didn't know what I would think of this flavor when I first bought it.  My husband was especially skeptical.  It turns out that it's my favorite summertime flavor and he's good with it too.  It's just the right amount of flavor without going overboard.  Who knew coconut and coffee would go together so well?  But I guess if you think about it, lots of ""nut"" flavors blend well with coffee.  In any case, I love it.  I'll definitely come back for more!"
"I was looking for a mix like McCormicks Medley blend which has the 4 types of peppercorns, coriander and allspice. This was the closest I could find, minus the allspice. This blend has great flavor. The only problem is the coriander is so large that it's hard to get into the grinder and the grinder gets plugged up, having to reverse grind. I do have a very nice William Bounds grinder, so it's not a big deal to me, I think.

"Nature's Variety is a great food at a fair price!  This food has none of the typical cheap fillers that most store bought dog foods have, like corn, soy, and wheat.  It also has no artificial preservatives, like ethoxyquin, BHA, or BHT.  I also like that you can rotate between proteins with minimal/no digestive upset, since the main formula is the same, aside from the meat source.  Every time I buy a 30lb bag with all the ingredients in it, it comes with a box of 10 of these"

"I've tried them all and this one ranks up there with the best (if you have a pod machine); and the best I've had from this brand; honest to goodness Kona flavor just like I drank on the islands. If you like a full-bodied cup and like Kona flavor (who doesn't), you won't be dissapointed with this one! It's top notch and worth the price!! Cheers!!! TL;DR Top Quality - Real Hawaiian!!

"Hands down this is one of the best prepared soups out there. Add 4 1/2 to 5 cups of water.  After it's cooked (about 30 to 45 minutes), I add yogurt to the bottom of the serving bowl, pour in the soup and mix. The yogurt helps to enhance the other spices. I sometimes add salt to this soup.  Yum!  It really is a favorite in my home.  If you love soups...try it.  You'll love it too. If you have kids and want to make a family-friendly"
"It is indeed a ""rich and creamy chocolaty delight"" if you use the smallest cup size on your machine.  Remember to shake the box well before using.  Some cocoa still remains in the K-cup after brewing, but regardless, you get a very satisfying cup of hot cocoa! TL;DR Became an instant favorite! (I'll be making more in the future)

"I've been a long-time consumer of Maxwell House International Coffee drink mixes, but I had never tried the Pumpkin Spice Latte flavor before. I've always loved their mocha and ""Vienna"" flavors, so I was excited to try this seasonal flavor. It definitely hit the spot! It takes almost the same as the Starbucks version of the drink. The pumpkin flavor isn't overwhelming, it's mild, but I prefer it this way. The spice and sweetness are, in my opinion, very similar to the vanilla flavor that I've tried. I also like the"

"The description reads ""Golden yellow color"", but what you get is a deep orange colored peanut oil. The culprit: the beta carotene. I guess this was added for health benefits & eye-candy.

"It is so wonderful to have access to chewing gum that doesn't use NutraSweet®/aspartame that it is hard to complain about this gum at all. Even so, there isn't much to complain about. The gum tastes good (if you like Juicy Fruit), and it stays chewable for a couple hours. The only problem is the flavor doesn't last long - maybe a few minutes. I can live with that. TL;DR Tastes like Juicy Fruit.

I'm not a fan of this gum because its not a great choice"
"I love anything made with cashews.  These cookies use to have a lot more 'whole sized' cashews which I really loved but now they are more homogenous.  They still have a great buttery, nutty flavor.  I don't buy them often though since they are high in calories and non-healthful ingredients.  A splurge now and then is terrific though since these cookies taste so heavenly.  I do recommend them... though in moderation.  Enjoy!

This cookies is my favorite! My family loved them so much."
"This soup is better than any I've ever made from scratch, and is incredibly economical.  I used left over rotisserie chicken, added a can of black beans, a can of white shoe peg corn, and a package of frozen cream style corn to the soup to make it more robust and topped my bowl off with shredded cheddar and a small dab of sour cream.  YUMMMM!  I'm back for more and to try other products by Frontier. TL;DR More on Frontier's site. "
"Am very limited in what I can eat, and this product is a definite keeper. Is easily and very quickly prepared. Left-overs store very nicely, and this is yet another  product I cannot find where I live, so am doubly grateful that Amazon carries this. TL;DR LOVE IT!!

"I have loved these from the beginning when they were delfa rolls and then danish ribbons. I was devastated when they were nolonger available and could not wait to try the ""new formula"" because they are not the same and they have a more artificial manufactured strawberry flavor.

I have been looking forward to trying the new formula and it"

Don't get me wrong. I love Intelligensia coffee... I buy it a lot living in the L.A. area.<br />But this stuff is just straight up not fresh. I may be a little bit more picky than your average coffee drinker since I usually always buy fresh and definitely always grind the beans at home. But there is a noticeable difference between buying from Amazon and buying from the store itself. TL;DR Not Fresh. Not Fresh at all!<br />And it doesn't help to know
"This is the third different type I've tried(Schnucks and Hapi).  They are very good, but a little crunchier/harder than the others I've had. That is the only dislike.  The hottest wasabi, but still manageable.  I like the Hapi brand a little better since they are not as hard, but these are a little cheaper so they are both great. TL;DR Very good and hottest wasabi so far I would definitely buy again.

TL;DR good taste but the flax is too crunchy and it is a waste.

And now I can't find them locally anymore, so glad to see them here.<br /><br />St. Dalfour raisins and cranberries are completely different from those which are packed dry. These are moist!

"Not only does this pack contain the regular varieties you can find at any broken down liquor store (like the one in the horror movies) and nothing else, but they package them FOR YOU.  Now, this is all well and good IF you're going to give a deal on them, which they do not.  3 packages for a buck? Please.  I'll limit my choices for a good price, or pay a good price for the freedom to choose, but I won't take a chance.  I'll also offer free shipping on any order over $100."

This is a fair-trade tea made by a minority community in China from very ancient tea trees, and it's simply delightful. The mellow earthiness of the pu-erh is complimented by the spicy ginger. A wee bit of citrus fills out the background. Simply gorgeous. An olfactory and gustatory delight. TL;DR Sensational and sweet tea! I've tried it before in my own personal tea. I"

As to the other reviews that state it's too salty, you can find the same type of reviews with many of these pre-measured packets.

They're like Slim Jim's that actually taste like you're eating meat as opposed to extruded grease logs.  They're just that tasty and not overly sweet.  If you're"

"These DZ licorice buttons are what are known in Northern Europe as Salmiak pastilles. Salmiak, or sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride salt) used to be prescribed as a expectorant for head colds. Sal ammoniac is also used as soldering flux to clean metal. The sugar was used to cover the very strong, corrosive taste. Those who've acquired a taste for them crave them.  All others spit them out within ten seconds. I used salmina as a substitute for salt in the salt of the salm"
"My puppy loves these treats! She's allergic to wheat and gluten so it's hard to find treats for her (and ones that she likes). She has naturally dry skin and these definitely help! The omega 3 & 6 fatty acids provide what she needs to keep her coat healthy and shiny. It's great-- they don't contain any wheat, soybean, glutens, bad preservatives, or by-products. Not to mention that the salmon and sweet potatoes in it are known to be easily chewy, so it makes a delicious snack to keep in your freezer.

While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway.

The reason I wanted true granules is that they retain the garlic flvor much longer than powder.

The Pacari Chocolate Covered Golden Berries are delicious!  I love goldenberries and they are typically very tart.  These goldenberries are mild in comparison.

"After years of never being able to have flavored coffee creamer because of all the hydrogenated oils I finally found this. I am for the convenience of the singles, but if you like big cups of coffee be prepared to use 2-3 per cup. It's a lot cheaper to get the large size if you drink a lot of coffee every week, but if your a once in awhile coffee drinker these are nice. They have a very nice vanilla taste and there is enough sugar to satisfy your taste buds with a few cups of vanilla. I've never had any issues with"

"CRACKERTILLA is a word I came up with because this snack is both a thin, round cracker and tortilla chip all in one.  It is light, crispy, and quite tasty. We strongly sense the company really believes that, ""Food Should Taste Good.""<br /><br />Although we were skeptical at first, the unique olive flavor attracted us to this product. In addition, there are NO artificial colors, flavors, or GMOs in the ingredients.<br /><br />I really like this chip because it doesn't taste like a chip,"

It's just the Muddy Buddies which are peanut butter and chocolate covered Chex which are then heavily dusted with powdered sugar, or confectioner's sugar if you call it that. I make these all the time at home and there isn't a huge difference, however these are less chocolaty than I believe they would be using the recipe on a box of Chex.  You can toss the bag in the fridge and they are very much a treat to eat, especially if you like chocolate covered"

"I once read that the reason there's a difference between American and European chocolate is that Americans view chocolate as candy while it's considered dessert in Europe.  This heavenly chocolate is definitely in the dessert category.  The almonds are perfectly tiny and dispersed throughout rather than the big chunks so often found in the candy bar purchased from the rack near the checkout.  The flavor is incredible.  I love chocolate and this one is definitely in my top five. TL;DR yummy

"These anchovies are packed whole in salt, meaning that in order to bring them to the looks of filleted anchovies you are used to, you will have to clean them yourself. Depending on skill, this process takes between 20 minutes to... maybe 1.5 hours, so be prepared to work hard for your fish. The idea is to place them under running water (from your faucet). The skin will peel and when the water hits the fish around its fin area it will make the anchovy look very dark. You'll need a good clean-up kit,"

I have always LOVED this and all of a sudden I made it last night and both my son and I had an after taste of rubbing alcohol when we ate it.

"My whole family loves black pepper chicken at Chinese restaurants and it was with that in mind that I ordered this sauce - trying to capture the restaurant flavor at home.  Unfortunately it is not even close.  There is black pepper in this sauce, but the flavor doesn't taste anything like the black pepper chicken sauce in the various restaurants we've been at.  I don't mind the taste, but my wife and kids don't like it at all.  If you are going for the restaurant flavor, this is your sauce - I would not be surprised to find it on sale"
After seeing this on every sitcom table in the UK I had to try it.<br /><br />Made by everyone's favorite Ketchup King Heinz...  HP Sauce pushes the vinegar to the forefront when compared to Ketchup.  Your mouth twinges with the tang of vinegar upon eating this... then you taste the sweetness from the tomato/sugars.  There was also a subtle sweet taste that was somewhat different then Ketchup... which I think is most likely from the dates looking at you when you're eating... the flavor is just right for you. 
"The price was awesome, much cheaper than what I'd pay in the grocery store, so that's good. The crackers themselves are also good, crunchy and wheaty with a little salt... basically what you'd expect from Wheat Thins. On the downside, the expiration date on them was about 15 days away when I recieved my six pack of these, that was a huge letdown. Honestly it's not like this is the type of product where the expiration date has to be taken out of the box. I was hoping a lot of these would be discontinued,"

Reviewers didn't rave on the taste too much however.  So after receiving these cups, I gave one a whirl, and had no problems brewing it.  I did notice that the box that they were packaged in could use some (might I say) environmental saving upgrades, and the box itself was a bit rough for my taste. I was very disappointed with this product."

For the past several years I have been making 500 rolled sugar cookies in maple leaf shape for a Breast Cancer Survivors' Retreat.  The event is always held in Autumn (the reason for the leaf motif).  Having pink sugar sprinkled before they go into the oven makes a perfect touch for this event.

I am a label reader. The new product has about one fourth of the nutritional values as before. What used to be 100% or close to it on several vitamins is now only 10%. It's a shame. They have ruined a great product. The taste is still okay, but the new formula doesn't dissolve well. This was my first time trying to use it as an anti-aging treatment"

I blend this with one of their herbal (non-caffeine) chai's - the roobios is great - using a half-half ratio. The resultant mix is delicious with milk and a bit of honey - and is a great pick-me-up in mid morning. Teavana is not very good, but it's nice enough to have on hand."

"Love the cinnamon flavor of this gum and it actually lasts longer than most gums.  I LOVE the fact that it doesn't upset my stomach and make me bloated like regular sugarless gums.  I am just reordering my 2nd tub. TL;DR No more upset tummy! I have to order it now and will definitely use it more.

"I saw these when they first came out so I decided to buy a box. Unfortunately I didn't realize they also make a crunchy version and I grabbed that box by accident. While both are good, I'm a big fan of the chewy cookies. I love oatmeal, but it's not very portable. These are a great cookie to snack on during the mornings or afternoon. TL;DR Delish.

The only real complaint that I have with these cookies is the texture"
These are disgustingly good. Full flavor and enough sour to get you really drooling. Try to eat only one or two - I guarantee it can't be done. Box comes with two 5-pound ziploc bags so they stay fresh. That's not actually a problem because after opening they don't stick around very long. Made the mistake of filling up my candy jar at work. I had people I didn't even know stopping by to snag a handful. They are made by Jelly Belly's. They are very easy to make. You can add a little extra

"I really liked the ingredients of this drink and the taste reminds me of the tropical islands.  The mango taste is strong and flavorful and the shot is easy to take in the morning for a great way to start the day.  The drink is thick and almost smoothie like, but has a great tropical taste.  It gave me a little energy to start the day and had a refreshing taste. TL;DR Tropical Energy Drink.

Review Summary: I am a big fan of Tropical Energy Drink"
I took a chance with this product (even though there weren't enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work. TL;DR Didn't make the cut.

My goal was to make a medium-sized mug of coffee.  With one pod, the coffee was way too weak.  I then tried two pods, and the coffee was still not strong enough.  It lacked flavor, and I found it very flat.  (For sake of reference, I like medium strength espresso beans and I don't like to use too strong coffee.) So, my"

"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are better than any homemade cookies I have tried or made. Which says alot considering I'm a former baker. They are so soft and tasty, even my 8 year loved this cookie and she hates oatmeal. I highly recommend these cookies.

"I did a head-to-head comparison between this product and the competing Carroll Shelby kit; Wick Fowler came out ahead by a significant margin. WF had a deeper red color and more ""three dimensional"" flavor, whereas the CS was more brown and tasted mostly of cumin (smoky) instead of the full flavor of WF. I'd definitely recommend using beer instead of some of the water; I also add a can of tomatoes when I make it.

"The first time I tried these, they were absolutely amazing. The fig-center was slightly gooey, and the cookie was soft. It brought back memories of the gluten-filled fig newtons I had given up 3 years before. I bought a box a few months later, and was sorely disappointed.

Condiment?<br /><br />I used it on tacos and the results were---ehhh.<br /><br />The chipotle imparts a smoky, earthy flavor which doesn't pair to badly with ground beef, but it also has some chemically-tasting unpleasant undertones.  Regular taco sauce and sour cream both proved superior to regular beef flavor in a variety of ways. It's the perfect way to"

I love these Chiclets! I do not go for sugar free gum and that seems to be the only choices these days.<br />So I like to stock up on these babies!

Buyer beware:  it is not uncommon to crunch down on something that feels like a shell, or sometimes even a rock or dirt.

"This isn't an everyday dessert.  It's very good, rivaling what you get at a restaurant.  The only trouble I have is getting it to come cleanly out of the ramekin pans.  I think the trick is (contrary to the directions), is to wait a couple of minutes prior to taking it out.  You could also buy a 2 piece pan. TL;DR Delicious but expensive. It's the same as the $2.99 $1.99 dessert"
"I usually drink my teas plain.  By this, I mean I don't add sugar or milk.  That way, I can appreciate the flavor the tea has to offer more fully.  This one is no exception.  The flavor is terrific!  I am becoming more and more pleased with the quality of Stash teas.  I'm happy to see this offered at Amazon, my grocery store only carried it for the winter holiday season. TL;DR Great after-dinner teas for the price. I will continue to recommend this brand to others!"
Agave is the best thing next to a slice of homemade bread. I use it in place of reg. white sugar. My mother is a type 2 diabetic and with agave she can have a full piece of her favorite Thanksgiving desert pumkin pie with no raise in her blood sugar. There is light and dark versions just like in maple syrup. I prefer the dark especially in baking and cooking I think it has more flavor. Try it in your oatmeal with cinnamon. You eat oatmeal with cinnamon. It tastes good and is great with a cup of milk or something
"My dog has diabetes and this is about the only treat out there we can give her.  She loves them.  She is an American Eskimo, and they love to chew.  This gives her lots of things to chew on.

Also, Amazon delivers stuff when it says, and my dog doesn't like waiting.  She likes to sit down at the bar, and the dog loves the food"

"After the high reviews on this product, I figured I should try it out... Maybe I had raised my hopes a little too high, because although this is does have a pretty good taste to it, I don't think it deserves quite 5 stars. You can really taste the apple flavor it in (a little sour), so if you like that flavor in your cereal, then you might like this product! I mixed this first with water, until the chia seeds became a goo-like substance, which helped the taste to blend together nicely... It's a good flavor,"

"Your guess is as good as mine regarding what Festival means when they claim that their canned shiitake slices are ""Fresh Pack.""  On a separate subject:  Unlike MW Polar brand of canned sliced shiitake, Festival brand does not add sesame oil, which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding unwanted calories from the ""bad"" polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (omega-6), which is the only kind of polyunsaturated fatty acid found in the shiitake. I can assure you that Festival"
"I bought this bulk packaging because it is a favorite blend that is used daily in the office. However, the description of ""Pack of six 40-count boxes"" was less descriptive than was useful. Upon opening one of the six boxes the internal foil packet had 4 tea bags in each and each tea bag was smaller than a ""normal"" tea bag. I had to use two to get the same strength as I usually do. The ""savings"" were not worth the hassle of dealing with open containers. They were also a waste of money. The packing material is extremely thin"

I've had the same experience as some others where sometimes they stick together, but other than that they've  been perfect for me.

They are a lot harder for me to find now locally, and Big Cherry just doesn't compare.<br />The chocolate tastes like it's infused with the cherry flavor, it's a milk chocolate that's a bit above grocery store quality.

This was always one of my favorite Chunky soups.  However it seems that when Campbell started advertising their new 'leaner cuts' they interpreted those words to mean quantity rather than quality. Last can of Sirloin Burger contained 4 pieces of meat (2 per serving).  Same with their Select soup.  My White Bean Chicken Chili also contained 4 pieces of chicken for the 2 servings. Guess it was a way to cut down on production costs but not price. I like to get what I feel is better.  I don't want to be stuck eating a bunch

I brought in the sushi kit one day and had so much fun surprising all of the counselors with sushi. The sticky rice adheres to the seaweed after it is cooked. The kit is ""beginner-friendly"" to rolling sushi. At first, I didn't really know what I was doing. The product tastes great even if you don't add salt. It doesn't have any salt in it (except for a couple of"
"I purchased this oil from Amazon for cooking and for use as an after-shower, after-bath body oil.  Delivery was quick through Amazon, and I was very pleased with the purchase.  The oil has a pleasant but light coconut fragrance and is very light-weight.  I haven't used it for cooking yet, however, I have used it after shower, and it is a great moisturizer that is absorbed into the skin well, leaving minimal-to-no oily residue on my face or under my eyes.  I have also used it for the first"
You only have to taste it once to realize just how bad all the other ginger ales are.<br /><br />There simply is nothing close to it.<br /><br />It is even better than any other soft drink period! TL;DR The one and ONLY ginger ale you should buy. It's the perfect blend of ginger and lime and it's
"If there is such a thing as gourmet licorice, this is it.  These taste like red licorice infused with fruit juice.  I can't say that I necessarily recognized the fruit flavor as distinctly pomegranate- it could just as easily be a berry flavor or other similar fruit.  Still, it makes for a tasty combination.  The result is not too sweet, and a bit firmer and chewier than what I was expecting. TL;DR Licorice is a good way to get a little extra sweetness and a bit of"
"I have been drinking Blue Mountain Coffee off and on for the last 5 years, switching it with Kona (I am a true coffee snob...). After the local coffee shop here decided not to carry Blue Mtn anymore- I decided to give this a try- I was not disappointed at all. This coffee is true Blue mountain, tastes as good if not better than the fresh roasted coffee from my local roaster, and gives that extra jolt of caffeine I have come to love from this coffee. I love that this has such a strong aroma to it! I can"
"I love Fiji water. I can never quite put my finger on what is different about it, but it is a significant and positive difference.  It feels different too. There are other nutrients in it, which are listed on the bottle, and this makes me feel like it is an enhanced experience of drinking water to stay healthy and hydrated. I definitely recommend it. (I also like the low prices and free shipping that are sometimes available on Amazon). TL;DR Love it. The price is a great bargain.

This is one of the best brands"
"This bread is delicious fresh out of the oven.  I use my Kitchenaid mixer to blend the dough together and shape this into bread sticks.  I've tried the recipe with and without the added cheese. Hands down they taste better and have a better texture without the cheese. Most of my friends can't tell that they're eating gluten free bread. TL;DR so good!

It's the best on the market for a reasonable price.<br /><br />Since I drink a lot of this tea, I've always tried to buy this larger sized package to save a bit of money.

I love that I am able to give them extra fruits/veggies each day with one great tasting drink.  Good source of antioxidants and has a wonderful alkalizing effect on their bodies.

"My husband and I have been on a gluten free diet for a few years now.  The texture of some of the gluten-free breads and most of the gluten-free pasta's is not satisfactory to us.  The majority of the pasta's we tried were mushy - yuk.  But Hearland's pasta products are far from that.  They are the closest thing to ""real"" pasta that we have found.  We can even eat them as left-overs, which is why we don't eat them with our food.  But that is not"
"I have a Westie with allergies and this product helped quite a bit.  I'm still shopping for the perfect food for my pet, but this is head and shoulders better than Nutro products.  It has fairly limited ingredients which is what you want when messing around with allergies.  Also the really nice thing is that it is baked and when Ivy eats it, her breath smells like cookies which makes kisses much more pleasant!  The product generally rates a 4 out of 6 for ingredients but I do love this product. My only other issue is that I am allergic to the"

"I actually think the soup is quite good. It's not ""low sodium"", but it's not excessive either. It has 560 mg Sodium, so that's 25% of RDA-that's a lot less than what you typically see in canned soups. With the soup base added, I will say there is quite a bit of pepper and onion that I detect, but again, I don't think it's excessive. I decided to go for the creamier version and use a cup of this, which is what I did. I like that the creaminess is a"
"This product is quite good.  I purchased a package to try before investing in bulk for the ""storm closet.""  They mix easily, no clumps, taste good, nice texture.

"I hate to write a not-so-good review of a product since it's based purely on taste... which is such a relative thing.<br /><br />Anyhow, I personally prefer my coffee to be sweetened, and this drink wasn't sweet enough for my taste.

"I love this tea. It tastes just like restaurants make when you add sweetened condensed milk (also easier to stir into iced tea than sugar). My only caution is that this stuff stains VERY easily. I used an iced tea maker with a bucket-style coffee filter to brew my tea and spilled a little bit on the counter while I was working and I had giant orange spots where the tea landed within a couple minutes.<br /><br />Also, the bag tells you to use 4 cups of cold water to make this.

"This powdered stevia is comparable in quality to other brands I have tried. Like other no- or low-calorie sweeteners, stevia is extremely concentrated, so the envelope contains other substances as well, in this case organic agave inulin and silica.

It's a nice tea but the problem here is that without reading the label you probably wouldn't identify passionfruit (unlike Kwong Sang's Mango or Wild Cherry, which are unmistakeable).

"I ordered these for our small law firm since clients occasionally ask for decaf coffee but it happens so rarely that it is not cost effective to keep decaf coffee beans on hand. Also, it saves the time of having to brew an entirely new pot of coffee. No one can tell that the coffee is out of a packet. It dissolves quickly into a very strong brew.<br /><br />Highly recommended for people who occasionally need just a few cups of coffee. TL;DR Great for people who like to make a small batch of coffee. It's very easy"
"It's a different box, but the ingredients look, smell and taste the same so what's the big deal.  It seems to me that all this is, is the same old product in a new box.  OK, new and improved(?) box.

None of the cups were damaged, or even dusty like others have said. I ended up getting 20 different flavors. So a majority of what I tried was pretty tasty, but there's just not much I liked"

I recently bought this box of Oolong tea a few weeks ago.  Generally I drink it at least twice a day.  Most of the time at room temperature.  It is an excellent tea with a very nice and smooth flavor.  Although it is free of caffeine I have found myself feeling more awake after drinking it.  At the same time I feel more energy I also feel as though I am able to think clearer.  It may not be a wonder tea that some people claim they can feel more awake.  I have not experienced this phenomenon.  I

Because grains and potatoes where everywhere in large amounts and the poor could always eat that.<br />Quinoa in America, on the other hand, has taken a lot more classy reputation and very well deserved, may I add. First thing to consider: It is unique and has a long history. Extremely high protein sources, a great deal of fiber, and high quality grains and potatoes"

"... I'd rather have half or quarter the amount if the quality was better.  There are plenty of flower tops and the quality in all respects is there except when it comes to flavor and active ingrediants.

I can only say it has to do with what's left in the bag."

It softens, becomes easily chewed, and the flavor comes out fully and easily.

The only drawback is the texture. The cheese has a"

They all had a great coats, no digestive problems and clean teeth. While I only have them for 18 months while puppy training, I can attest that they are still a great product. The only negative I have is"

"I just purchased a Tassimo coffee and drink maker (from Amazon, of course), and the Cappucino and Latte pods to use with it. I love the Cappucino and Latte, they are wonderful treats in the AM, or anytime, for that matter, but I wanted to flavor my drinks with something more. The Torani Syrups are wonderful, because they can be used for flavoring coffee, tea, even ice cream, and I get the full taste of their Syrups. I love their latte flavors and the Tor"
"I really enjoyed this fresh fragrant Jasmine White tea for what it was, but I would never personally spend so much for it.<br /><br />Perhaps I am not enough of a connoisseur to fully appreciate the subtle differences between this and other Jasmine teas I have also enjoyed.  Maybe I am just a cheapskate, but I can't justify buying something 4-5 times more expensive for a moderate increase in (discernible) quality.  My only regret is that it was not as bright as I had hoped for it to"
"I'm giving this 5 stars but only if you're experienced in handling a really slack, soft dough and because it's so complete, authentic and VERY good tasting.  It really should only give it 4 stars because the yeast was dead - so proof it before you rely on it!  I put it in my bread machine on the 'dough' cycle and when it got all done and ready to form, it was flat as a flitter.  It was late at night so I just left it in the fridge to dry.

Fast shipping, as always, and this bulk pack will last a while for a great price. TL;DR Great Deal!

"Having read the comments about these not browning, I cooked my first batch with the oven rack raised (2nd-to-top rack), and after waiting and watching, eventually found the perfect browned/done effect after about 25-28** minutes at 350 degrees. I use a jumbo-sized muffin aluminum pan, which makes 6 large muffins.  My muffins are beautiful and they taste as good as they look, but not too sweet. I follow the instructions to the letter with a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder for a good flavor."

"Unusual to learn our local super markets no longer carry this product. It clearly is superior to any competing brands so it must be a pricing/discount vendor issue. Whatever, Amazon has it handy and my clan loves it so I use it all the time. The Masterpiece Steak Seasoning is also a 5-star product that's much better than all the other steak rubs. TL;DR Masterpiece is a Masterpiece, but not the best, I've seen it on the market.

"It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea.  I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as I'm a wimp. It brings out the natural flavours that I've always been looking for in a fine, refreshing tea. I"
"This honey tastes great while eating few teaspoons or with Oatmeal or with tea. I even use with fruit salads. This is a great sugar substitute. I need to research why another reviewer mentioned china based. The bottle is also completely mess free and no drips and drops. Definitely recommend this brand based on quality. Have been using for over a year. TL;DR Tastes great and truly mess free, but it doesn't do as well as Chino and I can say that"
"i got this on sale for a great price.  i really like this brand and company, stevita, because they grow their own stevia organically (even though it's not certified organic) in brazil, and not china!!!

My boyfriend, who doesn't like sushi, really enjoys these too, so they aren't just for sushi lovers.

My other cat, who has IBD, likes them fine but doesn't love them, and they do not cause any ill effects in him.

I have not eaten pea soup in a long time because peas are a high glycemic index food but the picture on the can looked really inviting so I thought I'd try it again.  And it is truly delicious!  The peas are el dente and most are whole halved peas not just a mushed up mess.  The flavor is that of definitely fresh peas with enough ham pieces (though very little in size) to be perfection for the taste buds in every mouthful.  I'm so happy that I got the right recipe.

Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. The Pero is a little different. It does not taste much like"
"While I don't have more than 4 soft drinks a week, I make an exception for Jarritos, especially the lime flavor here. It's cheap, tastes perfect, comes in a glass bottle which helps with the taste, and uses real cane sugar instead of whatever the guys at Coke use. If you're looking for a lime soda that actually tastes like lime, go with this. Every sip I take of the lime flavor is savored, and I never want to rush through a bottle. I'm also always using a glass of water, so if it gets too cold"

"Yummy Gum - Best flavor they have. Really worth a try.  Flavor lasts long and tastes great. Has a good flavor burst and tastes like tropical fruit. TL;DR Yummy Gum - Best flavor they have. Really worth a try.

"These are very addictive. I can't believe that I can't tell they are wheat-free! They are super delicious and do not taste fake or odd in any way. The chocolate chips are divine. I have eaten entirely too many this week after discovering them because I was waiting for them to have a strange after taste or make my tummy funny, but no, these cookies are just perfect. The calories aren't too bad either. It's something like 36 calories per cookie. This cookie gives me that energy that I want and that I need. I am going to be"

I shopped by price and this was far and away the best price out there. TL;DR Best Price for the best price for the best service. I am currently searching for my next
"As for the merchant: Fast and  efficient, and accurate.  No hassle.  Which is all you can ask for.<br />As for the brand: I don't think any K-cups compare with French press or other traditional methods that produce such a nice, round, complete flavor.  But, for K-cups and speed, this brand is the best I've tried, and I've sampled many different ORGANIC brands and coffeemakers. TL;DR the K-cups are a must if you want the best possible taste.

"I bought these Tootsie Pops for my candy bowl at work.  I am the defacto *candy lady* at the hospital where I work.  I try to keep an assortment of different candies available - all individually wrapped, of course.  These suckers have really gone over well, and they love all of the different flavors - my personal favorite is Wild Black Berry. I also keep the original flavors, so I can have a big variety of suckers.  This makes for a perfect place for all of the different suckers that I've"
"This is an interesting twist on the usual white rice vermicelli.  I've eaten one serving of these and I can tell you that they are truly gluten-free.  However, they have an almost grainy texture that does not lend itself to soups.  These would probably work better in stir fry. TL;DR Truly Gluten-Free. Odd Texture. I'm not saying these were not gluten-free.  But they are very"
"For a sugarfree gum, this stuff is really tasty. It has an intense flavor at first that softens into a more subtle orange cream taste. It lasts pretty long, but I've had gum that's lasted longer. It'll definitely make your breath smell good though.<br /><br />This is my favorite, and probably the most accurate, of all the extra dessert flavors. The mint chocolate chip doesn't taste much like mint or chocolate to me although it is refreshing, and the strawberry chip is a bit more strawberry and not quite as sweet as it should be."
"I have been drinking Earl Grey for over 30 years and sadly watched the demise of my favored vendors one by one.  After the last disappearance, I tried the Taylors on the basis of the reviews.  Disappointment is not the right word. It smelled strange out of the box, and after brewing it properly discovered that it bore no resemblance to the dozens of different Earl Grey experiences I have had.  It is heavily dominated by the peaty nature of the Chinese black tea base (which makes the taste even more intense).  The aroma was not very appealing,"
"I love this coffee, and I would definitely buy it again. After reading a few other reviews, I think that's because I like my coffee flavorful (and not bitter), but not overly bold. This coffee has a full but subtle flavor that carries just a hint of dark beans (or French roast), but it's just a hint, not overwhelming. Very smooth: It would be easy to drink cup after cup. My only criticism is that the packaging was not as easy to open as some other brands.

My only complaint is that it is a little bit heavy to"
"The flavor is very rich and earthy. Blends evenly in baked goods and great in coffe and other hot drinks. This price for shipping was horribly outrageous though. TL;DR very nice service and service, no problems at all."

"I like sardines but don't eat them very often...maybe a 15 oz can every year, reason why I gave La Sirena 4 stars instead of 5 because there may be better sardines. Having said that, I am planning of storing food for at least 6 months and sardines seem to be an excellent choice just in case the world goes down the drain (or worst yet, a zombie apocalypse...just kidding).<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer. I like to eat some sardines but I do not usually like"
"This is a bulk case of the same creamer you'd purchase at the store.  Excellent, fresh tasting creamer delivered to your door and at a fraction of what other office supply companies charge.<br /><br />If you have popped containers, blame your mail carrier, not Amazon. TL;DR Quality Creamer:  You can find it in all major department stores, but it is"

"I purchased this as I wanted to give my baby an organic alternative to cereal found in supermarkets. I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.<br />BIG MISTAKE.<br />This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother-in-law said ""Boy, if I eat whole grain cereal in the evening, i act like a trumpet all night long. I'm sorry I didn't get a little too much in my day"
"I am amazed..I just bought a case to use as a preschool snack and I took one out to try and my three year old sucked one down in less then 30 seconds. I was shocked!

"The dog absolutely loves these! She gets anti-anxiety meds every morning and she will come running with tail wagging when she hears me open the pill bottle. Can you believe that? I don't even need to use the whole treat. I rip off about a third and they are soft so I mold it around the capsule. I then make her work for it by giving a few commands ""sit, stay, come, etc"" and she does them excitedly. After she gets her hands on the bottle it is like she has been given a new life. She"
"I received this jar of French mustard in a broken state. Within minutes of leaving feedback and sending an e-mail I was sent a response, an apology, and a new jar.

They have the best Frenchy Bee on the market, the highest quality ingredients"
"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple.<br /><br />The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are:<br />""organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice.""  Also, some vitamins and minerals are added.<br /><br />Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same:<br />Pectin and colored fruit juice concentrate, with added sugar"
"I tried this chocolate after I saw it on the Martha Stewart Show. I usually expect ""Milk chocolates"" to be sweeter, which is not the case with this chocolate. People who would like to get a taste of the best milk chocolate on earth should try ""Milka"". I can highly recommend it. TL;DR disgusting chocolate with a bad flavor."
"The taste is wonderful. Its not for those who like very bold coffee tho. If you enjoy blue blueberry. Pick up a pack and enjoy. TL;DR very good, but not very sweet.

"If I had been given this coffee in a cup I wouldn't have guessed it was decaf.  It is strong & good!  I have the regular version too and they taste about the same. TL;DR Best Decaf Coffee Pods I've ever tried and it has a very good taste.

"I never write reviews but in this case I had to make an exception.  To put it simply this stuff was HORRIBLE.  It was like drinking pink paint but not as good. After 1 cup I lined my garbage barrel with the rest.  If my barrel had taste buds it would have puked it back on me.  Stay away! TL;DR ugh I was very disappointed in this product and the price, but I will not buy"
"These are so delicious!  Such an easy snack to throw in my bag to bring to work or on other travels.  They taste good and are a good way to get some healthy fruit!

It takes awhile for him to be quiet when I open the container, but I give him one when I leave for a couple of hours and when I come back he is happy as a clam and much more quiet! I think it takes him about a half hour to calm down and get him out of his crate. I have no problem with"

I've found that they're so easy to clean, two is enough!  I only wish I had purchased them sooner. TL;DR I love these litter boxes! I have 3 cats, all healthy eaters, and I really love these boxes"
"I have used the individual bags of Pamela's Amazing GF Bread mix for some time, but I recently purchased the 3-pack of 4-pound bags.  I am very happy to report that the resulting bread is just as consistently wonderful as always.  Many of my non-GF friends have tasted this loaf, and they are amazed at how good it is! I use the stand-mixer-and-oven-baking method (rather than a bread machine), as I often make round breads. The loaf is moist and has a very nice and tender finish."
"These are really awesome - the flavor is unexpected, but perfect; gives a boost to ""plain old"" pork rinds - lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt/vinegar chips!!!  In addition, the company is quite pleasant to deal with, and all the other products I've tried are delicious and a good bargain, too. TL;DR Great snacking!

The first time I went to the shop to buy a bowl of pork"
"At the current price, these are a great deal (4 boxes for about 11 dollars), so hopefully that won't change. Cheeze-It crackers are one of those snacks that I think you can have at (almost) any age. They have a perfect amount of cheddar taste, not going overboard but still giving it a perfect amount of flavor. The bite-sized crackers are very easy to take with you and a perfect snack on the go or to curb hunger until the next time you need one. I love these. I also love these with a bit"
"This is some great stuff to mix with soup, rice, or any meat stuff.<br /><br />or keep it on the side to dip. It's pretty salty so be careful though.<br /><br />Great heat and garlicy depth.

"Wow.<br /><br />These are wonderful.  Not just wonderful in the special diet kind of way (because you've forgotten what the ""real"" version tasted like).  These are truly delicious.  Including my macaroon consumption pre-special diet, Hail Merry's blondies are absolutely the best.<br /><br />My diet is grain-free among other things.  Almond flour is often used as a grain substitute in baking, but I usually do not like it when you're doing it without it. I've also always liked a little bit"
"This is good stuff! When I went vegan the thing I missed most was cheese. I've gotten over it, but this ""chreese"" really brings back a flavor memory. Good texture, very smooth and creamy, and no nasty dairy. Excellent replacement for Mac-n-cheese. I doubt that your family would even know the difference. I'm sure it's more healthy too, not that it matters to me. TL;DR Yum! The only thing I don't like about this recipe is that it's a bit"
"I never thought this day would come. I left you, Cheerios, years ago when I thought there could be something better for me, something sweeter. People made fun of us, calling our love ""puppy love"". They even called you baby food.<br /><br />I was confused, and we took some time off. You went your way, and I went to oatmeal, then the flashy Kashi, and then many other cereals. They were ok relationships that would never happen again.<br /><br />It was a great time"

"I used 3 drops on my long, thick, color treated, hot styling tool used hair and it made my hair look like I poured oil all over it.

It smells wonderful however but I wont use it on my long hair as I don't like that smell.  I'm a"
"The look of the ham was somewhat dissapointing.  Having eaten Jamon Serrano throughout latin America and Spain... I was not blown away like I was hoping,,, it was OK but only OK. TL;DR not the best jamon serrano... but a lot better than any other. I was pleasantly surprised with my experience"

"My favorite pretzels in the world are Ener-g sesame pretzel rings-light and crispy and with seeds on the pretzels. Thought I was buying those,only in a bigger package.These are hard and dry-not crispy-dry!and must be made with ground sesame seeds because I can't find a seed on any of them.Next time will read description and check picture better. TL;DR not what I expected.

I like to make homemade pretzels with peanut butter and jelly"
"Frosted Flakes has been my favorite cereal since I was a toddler! I remember my mom taking a small box with her when we went to visit Aunts and Uncles because she was never sure if they'd have a box in the house. (OK, so once my Aunt had some in the house and she took offense; I guess my cousins liked Frosted Flakes, too!)<br /><br />They have that sugar on them that I absolutely crave; true, with a few of the same ingredients, but the taste is very sweet and creamy,"
The Mints arrived with a chill pack to insure they would not melt in the summer heat! The jar is handy for serving and the mints are fresh and tasty.

"I've tried a number of ginger beers/ales after stumbling upon some locally, and of those Fever-Tree is simply the best.<br /><br />I'm not picky about carbonation so I can't comment on that, but it has a strong ginger bite and isn't overly sweet. The real selling point is that the flavor comes from the ginger and not fruit juice or added spice, exactly what I want. I say this in relation to Reed's ginger beer which I place just below it.<br /><br />The only thing I can say is"
"I tried this last month in NYC where they were offering samples of it around Grand Central - really great tasting, which surprised me at first. It does taste great.  I go through 3-4 Iced Coffees a day which ends up running over $10 bucks easy. I'm so glad that you (Amazon) are now carrying this as I haven't been able to get it yet at the local ShopRite or Stop and Shop. Thanks - my iced coffee fix at work is a pain in the butt - but I'm happy with what my coffee does for"
"My family members have used words like ""gross"" and ""disgusting"" to describe these chews and I have to admit that I agree.  We routinely eat natural foods and snacks so I wasn't expecting Twizzlers - but I was expecting a product that tasted like raspberry.  Something about the molasses + fruit gives it a weird twang and a wretched aftertaste that was very much like prune juice.  If you love really dark molasses (like blackstrap) and are a sucker for raspberry, you'll love Twizzler.  It"
"Again, I was dissapointed.  While this tea was alright in flavor, and I love the concept behind the company and it's dedication to fair trade (not that this is one of the fair trade teas) but I've been underwhelmed.

I just ordered this after seeing it in my specialty pet food store.  It's a tad expensive but I can understand why.  I can totally read and understand all the ingredients!  And my picky dogs both LOVE it.  I also like that they tell you the calories per treat (8.8 if you're wondering) so I can better keep track of my dogs daily caloric intake.<br /><br />The fact that it comes in small pouches also is great so that's a bonus. I'm a big fan of the small ones and that
You wouldn't know this granola is gluten-free.  It's delicious mixed with yogurt and fruit.  It was delivered within the estimated delivery time and arrived in perfect condition. TL;DR Wouldn't know it's gluten-free because it's been delivered in the same way! I have a friend who is

"These peanut butter balls are great, full of protein and very satisfying.  There is only one caveat.  Keep them off of the counter if you have a tall dog.  My basset got the box down while I was out and enjoyed about 12-14 of these balls.  He was very satisfied, however he had a severe case of diarrhea for 3 days.  He, however, was very happy.  LOL TL;DR Fabulous product. I love them. 

The quality of this product is excellent."
"Let me start by saying that I love tea. I love Numi's teas the best as they are organic and also fair trade products. I have purchased many of Numi's other fine teas through both Amazon.Com & Numi in the past.<br /><br />However, the Dry Desert Lime tea is the first flavor of tea I couldn't stand the taste of at all! The Dry Desert Lime tea is tart, smells and tastes medicinal and looks like coffee when brewed. The dry flavor was a bit too harsh and was not good enough to warrant any"
"Ever since I saw Mio I thought it was a cute idea, but why do I really need flavor?

"Kellogg's does not disclose that the ingredients in their cereals contain GMO's. That means the corn and sugar have had their DNA spliced with another species, usually a toxin or a bacteria.

Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food.

"I switched from another, much more expensive, brand and now prefer this one.  This Vitacost coconut oil is not as clumpy as the brand I was using; and therefore easier to work with and mix with my flax and cottage cheese each day.  The flavor is good and I like the statements on the container:  organic, cold pressed (to leave in all the good healthy stuff), lab tested for heavy metals, etc.  Overall, an excellent value. TL;DR. 
This was the first time I tried using this.  I have"
"Moist, Flavorful, DELISH!! This cake deserves 10 stars! My husband finished it b4 me! It truly is delicious TL;DR super yummy! I'll definitely be going back and buying it again."
"I have been using stevia quite often the past 5-6 months.  The English toffee is just one of the flavors we get.  Using this helps me to avoid drinking soda and also helps to have more fluid intake than I have in the past.  The English toffee has a mild sweet flavor that I like. TL;DR perky toffee is my favorite.

My husband and I have had stev"
"I ordered these chestnuts on 8/20/2012 and received them on 8/24/2012.  The listed date of production on most of these packages is 10/29/2011 with an expiration date of 12/28/2012.  However, multiple packages contained molded, black chestnuts.  The insides of the molded packages were also very wet and sticky.<br /><br />I've purchased Galil chestnuts from local stores in the past and the products SHOULD be dry and not overly ripe.  I don't know if any of these items have"
"THIS IS IN MY TOP 5 CHIPS I love these things... literally I can eat the whole bag in one sitting (Im not a fatass, lol) Although it is pretty hard to find these things in texas. It seems as if they only sell them in the fall. idk but these are awesome and if i ever need some I would probably order from here! TL;DR I did not purchase from this seller. Just my review on the product.

"This peanut butter is what one would expect for the brand: good peanut flavor and nice creamy texture. However, upon reading the ingredients list I noticed it had hydrogenated oils so I don't think in this day and age one should consume that. There are plenty of other peanut butter options out there just as good but without funny ingredients. TL;DR Good taste and texture but don't care for the hydrogenated oils.

What is the best way to make peanut butter? I love peanut"
"I am disappointed. They work as advertised: quick, clean, and easy. However, more important to me is taste.<br /><br />While individually wrapped, the freshness of beans ground just for that moment is missing. The pod itself uses less coffee than I would in a single shot. Since I more often will make lungos, the sheer lack of coffee volume produces a weaker drink. Instead of pulling twice as long, I pull it 80% as long for a short shot, and it is a lot more satisfying. I would definitely recommend this product if you"
"One of the best shampoos on the market due to the fact that it's properties are predominately natural composing of oatmeal and tea tree oil. Tea Tree Oil is known internationally for it's tremendous healing properties and skin conditioning capabilities. I highly recommend this product to anyone. TL;DR Tropliclean Natural Shampoo is rated 4.8 out of 5 by 7.

Rated 5 out"
"This is just as effective as the stuff you buy at outrageous prices at Whole Foods Market in the bulk bins.  Buying it here makes it affordable to cook gluten free recipes! TL;DR Reasonable price for great product.

Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce is pretty good.  I go to TAco Bell because they have fast and cheap vegetarian fast food.  I tried the Spicy Ranchero Sauce and it taste just like the stuff they use in the restaurant.  I enjoyed the sauce and I would definitely purchase it the next time I find it in the store.  If you're a fan of Taco Bell's flavor sauces then you'l enjoy this one. TL;DR: It's a good choice of flavor sauce and a great deal! I
This large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog. It's also worth purchasing this larger sized bag (or get two of them at once) in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time. TL;DR Excellent dog food! I've bought this bag at the vet for about $100! If you're
This wine Kit is very good.  It has a large amount of juice to start with so that you have a very tasteful wine.  Recommend it to anyone that loves Cab Sauv. TL;DR Nice Wine - Great Value - Good Value
"I was first introduced to astronaut ice cream about 2-3 years ago and it is amazing and really fun to eat. I have a 4 & 8 year old boys and a 15 year old nephew that love these. They definitely are quite different from a real scoop of ice cream out of the freezer, but it is only in texture and the experience. I have since ordered these to give out at Christmas time for my son's classmates. I thought this would be a totally unique, great, and affordable dessert to bring to my kids and family, but I can't say I am"
"These chocolates at USD12 for 6 packs is a steal.<br /><br />It's not only cheaper than store prices but it's also more convenient. I don't even have to leave my house to get my hands on my favorite crunch chocolates. TL;DR Crunch Funsize is really Funsize, and I'm so happy about it. I have to say that this"
"The past two years this has been my go to Bold.  The 50 pk is a great value and the coffee reminds me of Rain forest Espresso or Santa's Buzz. TL;DR Best balanced Bold K-Cup with value to boot.<|endoftext|>This page provides information about the following types of products.

"We will not buy this mix.  We would rather go without.  The texture is terrible -- rubbery and full of bubbles -- and way too sweet. TL;DR Rubbery, sweet & floofy! I don't like the taste. But this will definitely be a great smoke"
"I love the Chocolate Glazed Donut coffee.  It is the best flavored coffee there is.  I use it as my bedtime treat.  I plan to buy more of it. TL;DR Good, good coffee from Amazon.

"This granola was so tasty, I couldn't stop munching on it after I opened up a bag. I gave 3 of the 4 bags away to friends and all of them agreed it tasted delicious. I tried it in hot water (like oatmeal), milk (like cereal), and straight out of the bag (as a snack) - all three ways were still great! Highly recommended! TL;DR Delicious!

5 out of 5 Very nice and easy to prepare! I love this"

"A couple of people commented that this candy is the same ORIGINAL product as the ones many of us remember from our childhood. It is NOT! I just received mine, and was expecting the same delightful taste from my childhood in the late 40's...I'm extremely disappointed! The colors are faded, and there is virtually no flavor at all! The packaging reads ""original"", which I find to be false advertising. This is NOT the original Necco wafers that I grew up with, as you can tell from the label. This has a very different scent and a"
