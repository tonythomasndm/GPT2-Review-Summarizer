"I purchased this product because I wanted a safe, natural, USA made chicken jerky treat from my long hair chihuahuas.  This product appeared in the search ""chicken jerky treats made in USA"".  Both dogs loved the treat, but it is VERY crumbly and they stick together, tearing into pieces when you try to remove one from the bag.  It is NOT ""jerky like"" in any way.  My chihuahuas finished off one each in under 10 seconds. I am buying this product again, but will purposely crumble them and use them for mini treats/training rewards only.  If you are looking for something for your dog to gnaw on for awhile, this is not it... TL;DR Chicken Jerky?????"
This is the only flavor of soft food my cats will eat. They eat dry food but the come running for this. TL;DR Love it
My cat could not tolerate Science Diet Prescription cat food so I tried this organic food.  This food eliminated her puking.  She has never had any digestive problems with the Organix dry food and eats it without hesitation.  She eats the Organix Adult and Kitten dry cat food with a little more gusto so I mix in some of that food with this one.  I plan to keep her on the Organix dry food indefinitely. Great products! TL;DR Great cat food!
"They are always running out of stock.  ""They say"" it's because of a hold-up at the border.  I say - who's checking inventory?  They were out of stock in April and again in August.  I was told on August 16 that they would have coffee in their warehouse on 8/17.  Today we still have no coffee.  How can a coffee company be out of coffee?  This is a recurring problem with Tim Horton and I'm getting really tired of it.  Perhaps you - Amazon - can do something to get them to fix this problem once and for all because they sure don't pay attention to their customers.  I'm surprised that you have any coffee left.  Usually when Tim Horton is out of coffee, so are you. TL;DR I like it - BUT......."
I enjoy hot coco and I must say that this is the best I have ever had. TL;DR The best coco I have ever had
"We have 2 dogs, both mini aussies, 30 and 50 pounds.  We were going crazy letting them in and out, and the last time we went on vacation and had a pet sitter come over, they chewed things all over the house waiting for her to come by to let them out.  So, my wife said, ""We have to get a doggie door.""  I began researching the field.<br /><br />We didn't want a traditional ""flap"" door because of the likely HVAC leaks and the potential for animals to enter our home.  So, I decided we needed something with an electronic sensor and lock.  The only other electronic door that has any sales volume is the Pet Safe door, but reviews for it were not at all favorable.  That left the High Tech Power Pet door as the only good option.  We had to buy a new patio door to install it (because our existing one was all glass), but decided it was worth it based on reviews.<br /><br />The reviews are correct (you can read many, many at[...]). This is the best solution for anyone wanting to let their pet out when it wants to go out.  Our dogs learned immediately how to use it.  Now we can go to bed at night knowing that if Pepper or Dusty want out, they can go out.  And squirrels, etc. won't be able to get in.  The only problem is our two cats feel left out.  But they lose their collars, and the sensors are expensive.<br /><br />The only negative is the sensor.  I know we are going to have to buy more of these, and at $35 a shot, that is going to add up.  Also, they come with a simple thin strap that goes around your pet's neck.  There is no easy way to attach it to a traditional collar.  They should make an attachment that permits this.  The good news on sensors is they are light weight. They are also directional, so if your pet walks by the door but doesn't face it, the door most likely will not open.  If your pet stands there in front of the door, it will stay open, waiting for the pet to go through.  It's basically a Star Trek door for your pet.<br /><br />The best part was Amazon Prime.  Not only was the door cheaper than ANY PLACE else, we got it in 2 days.  I love Amazon Prime! TL;DR The Best Overall Solution"
"Whenever I crave ginger cookies I go for these. They're not only wheat-free, but have just the right 'bite' of ginger. The sliced almonds in this soft cookie add a great touch. TL;DR If you love ginger..."
"Great product. I use it to clean my TIGER 3 Liter Water Heater. It can also be used to clean coffee makers, tea kettles, pots & pans, dishwashers, steam cleaners, and many other products affected by hard water deposits.<br /><br />Very pure and quality product. Place in a freezer Ziplock bag for freshness once opened. TL;DR Quality Product Cleans Hard Water Deposits"
I believe they wanted this cookie to taste like a brownie. I am so used to Chips Ahoy having that subtle choco flavor with a crisp bite that this cookie surprised me. It is gooey as stated on the package but the texture is awful. Enough for me and my daughter not to finish our cookies. We love cookies so you know that this was not a good one if we did not finish it! The taste is not a brownie taste. Can't even explain it. I am sure they are trying to branch out with more choices but how did this one pass their focus groups?? TL;DR Strange texture
"I bought my brewer last Sunday. I have been waiting a long time to buy it, and I'm really satisfied of my purchase! I could taste plastic in my first cup of coffee, but I ran a cycle with water and vinegar, and then a few cycles only with water, and it fixed the problem. I can't wait to receive my free k-cups from Keurig! I'm so satisfied I think I will buy a Keurig Mini to use at work!!<br /><br />If I had something negative to say, it would be the choice of cup sizes. If I want to fill a travel mug, I have to brew two cups, one large and one small cup. But otherwise, I'm completely sold to this product. Sure, I would like the k-cups to be less expensive, but if you buy them on the internet instead of the grocery store, you can save a lot. Also, you can buy a reusable plastic k-cup to brew your own coffee. I would recommend this machine to any coffee lover :) TL;DR I love my new brewer!!"
"I broke my own rule and read JUST the ingredients on the back of package. Sounded Great! I gave my dog one of these ""treats"" and she loved it. The next day I read the package more carefully - and guess what? Made in China printed right there in plain view. I am very disappointed in AKC for putting their name on these products. A bag of twists and a bag of chicken jerky went right into the trash. TL;DR Seriously Disappointed!"
"I found Rio Rancho Tostado Bowls in my local supermarket, a Hannaford's, and they were outstanding! I was blown away with the superb flavor. Unlike another reviewer, I did not find the product to be flimsy at all; they held up to the very last tasty bite. (Perhaps his or her problem was due to shipping problems, and not the product itself.) I love Mexican food, but dislike the artificial ingredients added to so many of the prepackaged items. This product tasted authentic, and I just can't praise it enough. In a word, they were YUMMY! TL;DR Outstanding!"
"The texture of the chocolate-covered raspberry jells is perfect, and the taste is so close to the original that I was totally satisfied. BUT: the sugar alcohols used to sweeten it are lethal to the digestive system. If you eat more than one of them in a single day, be warned. You're going to need a restroom nearby. However, if you can restrain yourself, these are a delicious treat. My only concern is the expense, so I'd recommend asking for the candies as gifts if anyone wants to know what you'd like for a special occasion. TL;DR Warning: only eat one!"
"I was using Dove's Moisturizing Shampoo/Conditioner. It did a good job with having soft hair, but I was having snow storms of dandruff and lots of hair breakage to a point I pick off ten plus hairs off my when I got out of the shower and throughout the day. Also, with the dandruff, after the owner of my workplace (who can be very picky on appearance, down to one flake of dandruff) walked in and seeing the amount of dandruff on my black uniform, I said ""That's it!""<br /><br />I walked into Walmart and looked at the dry scalp/dandruff shampoos. Head and Shoulders somewhat did the job, but my hair gets dry and brittle and did an okay job on the dandruff. I then stumbled upon Clear. I figured I'd give it a shot, even though it was a little pricey for me (The only downfall of this product, but better than getting $25 salon stuff). I got the Shea Cleanse and Nourish so that not only did my scalp feel happy, so did my hair. Good news, I needed shampoo and conditioner anyway. I ran out of the Dove anyway.<br /><br />Went home and used it that night. The results were immediate on the spot. 75% of the flakes were gone, my scalp showed major improvements, and my hair was shiny, smooth, and soft (even though I use the Suave Keratin Serum as well, this made it go from bleh to SWEET ZOMBIE JESUS THAT'S GOOD!). The nice scent of shea was relaxing and nice, and it lasted too. I walked into work the next day (I wash my hair every other day) and a co-worker grabbed me and said ""Why do you smell sooooooo good?! I want that!"" So, told her it was my new shampoo/conditioner.<br /><br />And as for my black work uniform, I have not had to brush off flakes or pluck ten plus hairs off me!<br /><br />My hair has never felt better. I wash it every other day, and focus on the scalp a wee bit more so that I know it's doing its job. I only use a hair straightener (with a heat protection spray) on the lowest heat setting and my hair still feels and smells amazing. A male friend of mine also has the exact same problem as me and he will be getting some today to help him out (I told him they had a mens line he can look into).<br /><br />Get it! Trust me, you won't be sorry. You want a happy scalp and hair at the same time, get this. I'm not regretting it now. :) TL;DR Where have you been all my life?!"
"I got this for my sisters jackabee in NYC. She was not happy about it. Apparently it makes a mess all over the apartment... But her dog loves it. And thats the important thing. The dog was a little intimidated by it, but very quickly warmed up to it and started dragging it everywhere. Much to my sisters chagrin. So I would say this is definiately for large outside dogs. My sister now keeps it in the dog food until she can supervise its consumption in a safe area. The dog didnt get sick from it or have any adverse side effects as some other reviewers indicated.<br /><br />This bone is perfect for the large loved outdoor dog in your life! TL;DR Huge and messy"
"I'm so glad I found the larger bag, because this is the BEST coffee ever.  Now I can go longer before having to reorder!  Follow the directions, do NOT add any sugar, sweetner, cream, or milk to this.  This coffee puts Starbucks to shame! TL;DR So good I bought the bigger bag!"
"The good news:  Very easy to make, tasty good noodles, a few veggies<br /><br />The bad news: 1130 mg of sodium (about half your daily allowance) -- Yikes!<br /><br />Notes: 290 calories, 0 mg Cholesterol, 2g fiber, 2g sugar, 7g protein, 11g fat (6g saturated fat)<br /><br />These noodles are tasty, the broth is OK, there are a few veggies sprinkled on top.  Pour in boiling water wait 3 minutes (or longer) and you're done.  A good, quick, hot lunch when you're in a hurry.  But don't eat too often as the sodium content is incredibly high and would not be good for you.  OK once in awhile, though, unless you're on a sodium restricted diet, in which case, why are you even reading this far? ;)<br /><br />Tip:  You can probably reduce the sodium content by pouring off the liquid after preparing and eating just the noodles and veggies.  Or add your own healthier liquid broth, even, if you wish.<br /><br />Also, you can let this sit for 6-8 minutes of even longer and it will be good and still very hot. TL;DR Good noodles but incredibly high sodium content"
"I bought this juice to promote joint health and was pleasantly surprised by how delicious it is.  I have been using black cherry juice concentrate (which I like), but Tart is Smart juice is so much more yummy. TL;DR Delicious!"
brown rice and rice in general has a lot of arsenic! any rice or brown rice syrup from texas and other southern states is dangerous! avoid this!!! when eating rice products buy rice from asia. TL;DR WARNING ARSENIC
I loved these growing up and still do.  They really don't contain a lot of calories and now I have to hide them from the kids.  They were nice and fresh.  I do wish they were a bit cheaper but this is the best deal I've found anywhere.  Since they are imported it makes sense that they cost a little more then some other types of candy.  Love these! TL;DR These are a favorite from the past
"This is some very good sauce. I like it on fried meats, fried chicken especially. Goes very well with rice too.<br /><br />It has an interesting flavor somewhat similar to worcestershire sauce. Try it for yourself and see! TL;DR Great Stuff"
I have tried one other brand of canned whole lobster and really found the Bar Harbor brand the very best.  I also decided to regularly order two cans monthly using Amazon's subscription service.  Now I get an automatic order monthly! TL;DR Excellent Lobster Meat
"I am disappointed with this product. I used it in my coffee on several different days but I can't force myself to like it. It is not very sweet at first taste. Then the sweetness starts coming as almost an after taste. Then there's a strange after taste that follows the sweetness. I'm trying hard to like this but just can't. TL;DR After taste, not sweet enough"
"This is one of our very favorite sauces for many meals. It is great for meats, egg dishes, cassaroles and other applications.  We have bought this by the case in the past! Glad we can still purchase it. TL;DR Best Sauce!!"
"I found out about these bars in a news article. Apparently the woman behind these bars is involved with developing foods that are okay for people with Crohn's Disease. Knowing people who suffer from this, I picked up some of these bars since they are supposed to be easy for them to digest. I've gotten good feedback about them, so I would definitely buy them again. TL;DR Great Product!"
"This has got to be one of the better tasting brands of chocolates out there on the market.  Tried a sample of it, got hooked and ordered it over and over again.  Everyone I've given it to always says how good it tastes.  Makes a wonderful gift or even just as something to treat yourself to!  Have tried several kinds, the Mill Creek, the Family Assortment, the white chocolate pretzels.  In one word, DELICIOUS. TL;DR Delicious candy!"
"As good tasting as any non organic corflakes out there... and better... being organic means no GMO... yeah!!!!  They are really nice for breakfast time.  Only problem was all six packages came tied together with packing tape... no thought put in packing the six boxes.  The boxes were destroyed in order to separate them .. what a shame someone was giving a roll of packing tape who did not know how to use it properly. TL;DR Great Product, not so great packaging"
I have been ordering Lavazza espresso pods from amazon for several years now. My recent order has pods made with a different paper that make tan water not coffee. I can not find anyone to respond to my complaints. All I ask is that they replace the defective pods. My espresso maker works fine. TL;DR Major screw up and no customer service available
"Compared to a national franchise that has a last syllable of ""buck$"" (cheap shot, I agree), this easy-to-make mix is just as rich, but perhaps not as overtly sweet. (Plus, you don't have to commute for your chocolate, you get a cool plastic container with ""chocolat chaud"" written on it, and you know the contents of what you're drinking!) Mr. Domingo Ghirardelli began his company more than a century ago, and today, Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix is made in the San Francisco Bay area (picturesque San Leandro--south of Oakland, north of Fremont). Of course, Ghirardelli Square in San Francisco is a well-known and loved attraction for native and visitor alike, where diners can watch as the giant Wonka-like mixer whips up the potion.<br /><br />At home, simply microwave milk or water for 3-4 minutes and add the mix, or put liquid and mix into a small pan, and stir until you've reached the desired heat. Whipped cream or marshmallows are traditional accoutrements, although drinking it straight is an experience just as beautiful. Ingredients are sweet ground chocolate and cocoa (the latter contains sugar, cocoa processed with alkali--they are very forthcoming about its manufacture--unsweetened chocolate (also process with alkali), soy lecithin--an emulsifier, and vanilla. C'est tout!<br /><br />Not counting the milk or water base, 3 tablespoons of chocolate mix has only 80 calories, 1.5 grams fat (0.5 g saturated), 19 g total carbohydrates (of which 1 g is dietary fiber and 17 g are sugar, not clear what happened to the other one gram), and there is even one whole gram of protein, and 2% of the recommended daily value of iron!<br /><br />OK, so it's not exactly a health drink. But it is relatively low fat, no or very little caffeine, and, most important of all,  makes a ""bowl of soul,"" a creamy rich, closed-eyed dreamy experience of fragrance and flavor, that only reminds you of the good things and prepares you for the others. It may move you, as it does me, to rhapsodic heights. Twenty servings per can, give some to your sweetie. TL;DR You Gotta Love It!"
"I'm having some of this for lunch & wow. I'm not a great cook but this makes me look like a chef!. This rice, first batch, is fluffy & light, The aroma & taste are light & fresh like rice from the Asian market. The whole kitchen smells delicious. This rice doesn't seem even distantly related to the usual grocery store rice.<br />The product is very clean in a beautifully prepared/sealed bag.<br />Will order this again! TL;DR Yumm. Easy, quick . Cooks like a pro!"
"I would have to say it is the most flavorful and delicious hot sauce that I have ever experienced. Even though this is labeled hot, the bursting flavor will make you forget that it's a hot sauce. I recommend it to anyone. TL;DR Best Hot Sauce Ever"
"I work at a senior center where we have a red hat ladies event and you would not believe the enjoyment from everyone watching their tea brew and turn into a flower! I know these are more common in country's outside the US, but I can't believe these are not sold in specialty tea shops or even megamarts! And not only were they very pretty but also very tasty! Well recommended! TL;DR Great Entertainment"
"My baby prefers this ""ready to serve"" Enfamil Premium over the powder type.  Since Enfamil Premium Infant came out a bit sweeter (compared to Enfamil Premium Lipil), my baby loves it.  Even though it is a bit pricey, Amazon sometimes has it on sale for $34 a case of 6, which is much cheaper than Babies R Us and Walmart. TL;DR Great Product"
"I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon. TL;DR It burns!"
"These are the best stuffed grape leaves I've tried so far. They look just like in the picture, none of them were split. I immediately ate half of the can and very pleased with the taste. The spices and the lemon flavor make them very tasty. TL;DR Delicious"
"what a great deal yummy candy in this soaker gun,my boys loved eating the candy then squirting each other,lol TL;DR kids love these!!"
Both  dogs are loving this food and eat it readily - they seem to be losing a little bit - that was my goal - Soooo I have to say this dog food works for them<br />Lots of good things in there for them - I like it TL;DR dry dog food-low fat-
I am always looking for healthy choices in food and products to help lower cholesterol without taking medication. This product is definitely not available in our area. Amazon has it all! TL;DR Great product
"This product is OK, but it contains too much hays which are very thick and hard.  My bunny doesn't eat the hard hays unless she is starving. TL;DR OK, but too thick and too hard"
"Excellent,rich coffee,I grind these beans,and brew them in my Bunn drip coffee maker.Some of the best I've found. TL;DR dark coffee"
"I'd have suspected that the vanilla mint wouldn't be the favorite between our four dogs, but it is!  These treats fit into a variety of the everlasting treat balls.  We have the large blue one that takes two 'dog hockey pucks' and two orange ones that take one each.  These are about the density of bone, and are made of not particularly nutritious stuff but are excellent for cleaning teeth and  giving the jaws a workout.<br /><br />We have a very old, very big malamute, another pretty old pointer, a big...err...we're not sure what he is exactly, part rotty, part small bear, part cat...and a black lab puppy.  Everyone loves the everlasting treats, but this is definitely the favorite followed by the barbecue/smoke one.  The malamute isn't much for chew toys, but he absolutely mauls this like he was 12 years younger.  Everyones teeth look considerably better after a few weeks of these treats. TL;DR All four dogs love these"
"like, ooo my gosh. i think i have found like, the best candy, in the world! aaaaah! they awake in me a strange and perverse desire to bite off the heads and leave them in my purse for month after month! they go good with everything, like ice cream and even eggs. i recommend this candy for everyone, especially if you're in your tweens, or if your name is c-rieeazzall. which it is not. so stop pretending and go buy some of these swedish fish! TL;DR AAAAAAGH ITS BETTER THAN CRACK!!! AND ATKINS BARS!!!"
"Does this mix make adequate pancakes? yes. Does it make great pancakes? No. So I give it a ""good enough"" rating. TL;DR Good enough"
"So I've tried all the major brands out there - even used to have the Subscribe and Save to Zico for the past year. I've been on the ONE Subscribe and Save for the past 3 months and I must say, I'm extremely thrilled.<br /><br />Tastes great - fresh young coconut water taste. Highly hydrating product, even great when recovering from illness.<br /><br />--- Slightly gross story so avoid if you want ---<br />I recently had a sinus infection and the high amount of potassium helps with thining out your mucus so you don't have as much pressure in your head. Worked like a charm and sure beats eating 2-3 bananas a day and it helps keep my hydrated!<br />--- end story ---<br /><br />Keep in mind I work for a large food & beverage company and I can tell you this sure beats any product we make!<br /><br />Overall, I love this product, wish they still had the 50% offer, it was a STEAL! I will continue to keep this as a S&S product for my household. TL;DR Tried them all - heavy user and this is the best"
"As every chocolate, this is high in fat and saturated fat. I'm a choco-holic and can't live w/out eating chocolate every day, and since I can't control myself, I ordered these. The taste is really good. If I didn't know it was made with Splenda, I wouldn't have guessed it's made with sugar substitude. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is the high price and high saturated fat. But after all, better than eating regular milk chocolate! TL;DR Very delicious, but..."
"This is a coffee on the light side between a mild and medium roast. It is just right for a wake-up in the morning. We will continue to buy this blend at the subscribe and save rate. The price for the 80 count is excellent and, in all ways, it seems to be an great purchase. TL;DR San Francisco Breakfast Blend Coffee for Keurig"
"I do like the flavor of this EVOO, but it is extremely clear for ""unfiltered"".  Will keep looking for a better ""unfiltered"" TL;DR Good, but question ""unfiltered"""
"My 9mo old loves these. They are quite airy and delicious too, perfect exception to the ever present cheerios snack. Love that they're organic and made of decent ingredients. TL;DR Perfect snack"
"I am really enjoying the variety of great coffees in this sampler pack. I can now appreciate the qualities of the various blends. I was born and raised in Italy and I am very demanding when it comes to a real, Italian espresso: I am totally satisfied with the ESE pods and machines (mine is a DeLonghi): just remember to only use the first drops of coffee for perfect body and ""crema""! TL;DR Wonderful selection"
"Thats what we acted like when we set up this machine and made snow cones.  Easy set up, the ice was shaved like a slush bought at a baseball game!  We tried a variety of flavors that were all pleasing.  It never stopped working for a neighborhood party and we mustve made approx. 30-40 cones counting all the adults.  Cleanup was a breeze, just drained right out.  No washing or turning it around to get all the water out.<br />Our only regret was that we didnt purchase this 5 yrs. ago. TL;DR GROWNUP KIDS"
So after almost dying of dehydration from the grocery store sold pumpkin seed that are mostly salt with some seed. These Energy Club Seeds are outstanding. You can easily eat tasty handfuls without having to have water standing by. Enjoy. TL;DR Pumpkin Seed: The Better
"This is the best Snapple flavor I have ever had.  It is very hard to find, though!  However, this price is way too expensive.  I have only been able to find it at one local deli and they ordered a case for me. TL;DR Best flavor ever!!"
"Sir Kensington's did a great job of updating the classic ketchup with this wonderful product. The refreshed taste of this Ketchup is a great update, and now leaves me disappointed when I'm given Heinz while out at a restaurant.<br /><br />For you Heinz die hard fans out there, this is not the ketchup for you. But for those of you who wish you always knew what ketchup could be without the chemical aftertaste found in Heinz, be sure to give this Ketchup a try.<br /><br />Don't forget the spiced variety. Purchasing the pack with both the classic and spiced variety for your first Sir Kensington experience is definitely the way to go. TL;DR Deliciously scrumptious"
"Makes a great snack. If you read the nutrition panel you'll be impressed. Nice to stow in a back pack or an office desk. TL;DR Great low carb snack, vegan, low fat, protein"
"Love the flavor. Not a very strong maple-brown sugar flavor, but enough to get the taste. We eat this stuff for breakfast and I take some for a snack for lunch, so the quantity of 5 boxes in one order seems like a lot, but for the price and for how quickly we go through it (2 of us within about 1-2 weeks) this is a great deal! TL;DR Great granola!"
my cat loves this food and for 24 cans of food for 11 dollars thats a steal...its a great buy and i will be buying more! TL;DR friskies
"This is by far my favorite bold coffee!!  It is rich, bold and holds up well with my flavored creamer!! TL;DR Bam!!"
This hard to get item is not only tastey but a great<br />snack to control hunger. TL;DR Turkey-licious
Our three dogs love it.  We have an older lab with sensitive stomach and he has been great with it.  Highly recommend. TL;DR Great product
I bought a bag of these for a party.  I didnt have time to toast the pita myself.  I saw these and gave them a try.  They were prefect.  A quick way to have a stylish dip/chip at a party.  Also easy to transport.  I loved them & so did my guests. TL;DR Perfect for Hummus & Pita
"These bottles really are great. I breast feed but hate to pump, so these bottles are great for my husband to feed the baby while I run out to the grocery store, or take a nap! 2oz is enough to tide the baby over without messing up my supply. My baby is 5 months now and he's just starting to outgrow these bottles... he needs 3-4oz a feeding. TL;DR Great product"
I bought these for $9 for a box at 18 ct at Big Lots - nit from Amazon. I love them.  Not an overly flavored French Vanilla taste - just a smooth cup of coffee.  I prefer Starbucks and Tulley's - but for this price. TL;DR Not my #1 choice - but a strong #3
product comes with water absorbing crystals. If you add too much water they expand to over twice the container size. never did get to see if it would grow other wise. TL;DR dont add too much water
"Perfect coffee at a really good price. Can't complain anything about it. Color, taste, smell are all great.<br />I would prefer the smaller boxes to be sold at this price to retain freshness throughout the use. TL;DR Just Perfect"
The blend of ingredients is great and a good balance of dried fruit and nuts that our family enjoys. I was having trouble finding it in the local stores that I shop so I thought I would shop for this online. I was happy to find it but unhappy about how much more it costs to order online than picking it up at a local store. I don't think I will order it again online and will simply keep my eyes open when I shop locally. TL;DR Great product but expensive.
"I saw this at my local Dollar Tree which I had just begun frequenting.  I thought ""..hmm name brand, Snapple, sure why not"" and grabbed it to try.  I don't usually drink Snapple products so I have nothing to compare it to, however, being an avid drinker of Emergen-C and other powder based water flavour-ers I was eager to try this.<br /><br />It was actually quite good.  I split one pouch among two 16.9 fl oz bottles of water.  I like it a little diluted; just enough to get my tastes buds going.  Though I must admit, in the morning, even diluted it's too sweet for me.<br /><br />I was not expecting this to taste that good.  Word of advice, follow the directions.  I didn't the first time and dumped it in and wondered why the powder wasn't dissolving and almost swore off the product for good.<br /><br />If you can get it for a $1 at your local dollar store then I say it's worth it.  At 10 cals a pack it's much better than a soda or energy drink :) TL;DR Not bad at all.. especially for a $1!"
"This jam is quite tasty and, like many other people who consume it, I choose it rather than a normal type of jam because it is lower in calories. However, I don't deceive myself that it won't raise blood sugar. Yes, this jam is, as the label states, ""sweetened only with fruit juice."" However, any jam which is not made with artificial sweeteners--which this one is not--inevitably derives the vast majority of its calories from some type of sugar. Because of this, the sweetener will appear first in the ingredient list, as is the case with this jam: ""Juice concentrate (pear, grape), raspberries, maltodextrin (dietary fiber), fruit pectin, citric acid, natural flavor.""<br /><br />This product is essentially almost 100% fructose because Polaner has substituted fructose for sucrose as a sweetener and it also is made from whole raspberries. This is a reduced-calorie jam because, since fructose is twice as sweet as sucrose, the producers only need to use half as much of it as they would have of sucrose. Meaning that this jam has about half the calories of regular jam.<br /><br />If you have never had this jam before and are used to regular jam, this jam may taste different to you and initially you may think it isn't quite as sweet. To my own taste, though, since I'm used to eating this brand of fruit spread, it tastes quite sweet enough to me.<br /><br />As stated above, this product contains no artificial sweeteners of any kind. Virtually every artificial sweetener ever sold to the public has been associated with health hazards, including the most serious one of all, cancer, and less serious but quite aggravating problems such as headaches, allergies, brain fog, and digestive problems. This jam also contains no high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) which is currently the principle sweetener in processed foods in the United States. Fructose that occurs naturally in fruit--which is what is used in this jam--is one constituent of a whole food that has many other healthy nutrients within it, such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, manganese, and zinc. In contrast, the fructose in HFCS is made from a chemical process. Not only is the fructose stripped entirely from the corn it used to be part of, it now contains unnatural chemicals as well, so nothing healthy remains for the body to utilize to nourish itself. In addition, when HFCS is consumed, it cannot be digested in the small intestines as fructose from fruit can. Instead, the liver has to process HFCS. The liver turns it into triglycerides which cause two main, interrelated health problems. They either are immediately stored by the body as unnecessary fat, leading to obesity, or they clog the arteries, which promotes heart disease and cancer. In addition, digesting HFCS is harmful to the liver, one of the most vital organs in the body.<br /><br />Though this low-cal product has sidestepped those two main issues, I do have a couple of health advisories about it for consumers. First, since the fruit pectin in this product is a standard thickener in jellies and jams and its own natural form of fiber, I am not sure why Polaner opted to add in maltodextrin and call that ""fiber"" too. Anyone with a gluten intolerance should be wary of this product because of the maltodextrin since some people with gluten intolerance are getting sick from the maltodextrin in this jam. The producers claim on the label it is ""gluten-free,"" but maltodextrin can be made from either wheat or corn, and apparently this company is not being careful enough about contamination with gluten.<br /><br />A second problematic ingredient is its ""natural flavor."" It is possible that the producers have added raspberry extract, a chemically derived substance that has a taste similar to real raspberries, in order to get away with using less real raspberries, which are more expensive than flavoring. The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is: ""The essential oil, oleoresin, essence or extractive, protein hydrolysate, distillate, or any product of roasting, heating or enzymolysis, which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice, fruit or fruit juice, vegetable or vegetable juice, edible yeast, herb, bark, bud, root, leaf or similar plant material, meat, seafood, poultry, eggs, dairy products, or fermentation products thereof, whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional"" (21CFR101.22). That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food, but the process by which it is derived is anything but ""natural,"" and shrouded in purposeful mystery so that the consumer is lulled into believing a product containing it is far more healthy than it actually is. TL;DR Delicious taste, but you pay a premium to substitute fructose for sucrose"
"My 2 GF/DF girls love this instant oatmeal. We have tried MANY MANY brands for a quick breakfast option and this one is by far the best. It is a bit sweeter than old fashion oatmeal, but not overbearing by any means!  Great start to the day! TL;DR GF/ DF done right!"
"This is the second box of Walkers Shortbread I have purchased, and I think it is the best shortbread around. So buttery and good. I will purchase more soon. TL;DR Once again I have to say ""YUMMY!"""
These are an amazing healthy snack! 34 sticks per serving and all the varieties are in the low hundred for calories! You really cant beat that and with great flavor and crunch. Happy snacker!!! TL;DR I wish I could give them 6 stars!
"My Mom loves it! The flowers are beautiful and fresh, the gift is wrapped carefully and the service is very good.Thank you! :) TL;DR Excellent service!"
By using the get $25.00 off for a purchase of $49.00 or more I was able to purchase two of the 12ct boxes of family sized tea bags for a very affordable price.  I have used the promotion in the past and will most definitely use it again in the future.  The teabags are very fresh and the shelf life is more than adequate to ensure I'll use them up before they expire. TL;DR Taking advantage of the special offers!
"I had doubts the pill pockets would work with our cat, because she prefers hard, crunchy food.  I waited until she was hungry. She sniffed it and decided to give it a try.  She chewed and chewed and chewed on it.  I thought she was going to spit it out, but it all went down. TL;DR Worked Great!"
"Excellent lady Fingers!!! I have used them several times and they are perfect. I will order again. Getting them in this amount allows me to have what I need in my pantry when I get ready to make Tiramisu, no running out to the store hoping to find them. TL;DR Perfect Lady Fingers"
"I ordered $35+ of product to qualify for the free gift. I added the promotion code during checkout. Needless to say, I was confused when everything BUT the free gift arrived. I contacted them asking if they would track where it was, and was told:<br /><br />""Thank you for your email. I apologize, but the cookies are not on your order from Amazon.  As per the instructions on Amazon,  you would have needed to put them in your cart and use the promotion code.  Promotions are not automatically applied. I apologize for any confusion.""<br /><br />So there you have it. Unless you clicked on the box that says ""here's how"", you would never know you needed more than just the promotion code to get the free gift. You do, indeed have to add the free gift to your cart AND use the code. Wish they said that on the main page of the product. Maybe they'll update the product page now that there is a complaint.<br /><br />How do they taste? I have no idea. I'll come back and edit this after my husband opens them on Christmas morning. TL;DR Free Gift Promotion has a trick to it."
THESE TASTE GREAT.. ANOTHER ITEM I BOUGHT FOR AN EX BOYFRIEND NOW SO I ASSUME ALL IS GOOD SINCE I DON'T HEAR ABOUT IT. TL;DR GOOD
"These are a wonderful alternative to expensive K-Cups.  After opening up the sealed bags, I kept mine in a ziplock bag until use.  The 80 count French Roast is significantly cheaper at Costco. TL;DR Cheaper @ Costco"
"I just received my order.  Big box for 2 ounces of chocolate.  But I find it is all protected and cool inside a thermal container.  So that's why the shipping and handling cost more than the chocolates.  Okay.  Get through that and there is a little box with five little pieces of chocolate.  They must be pretty special and pretty hot I imagine.  So get a glass of water handy and pop one of the more than $5 each little pieces in the mouth.  Wait.  Those ghost chilis will kick in soon and set my mouth on fire... Right?  Nope.  Not that good a chocolate.  And no ghost chili kick.  I could get a good chocolate bar with real chili you can taste for about $1 at world market.  Oh well.  So it's all a learning experience.  I learned that the ingredients on the container actually says that somewhere in there they sprinkled some dried ghost peppers in there.  If you want to impress someone by telling them you ate ghost chili chocolate, but you can't take the heat of real chili, then this might be the way to go.  But I wouldn't waste my money.  Unfortunately there were no reviews for me.  But now you have one.  Extremely disappointed. TL;DR i wouldn't"
It is a great cereal.  It really hits the spot!  It is great to have something that is so easy to prepare and taste so good! TL;DR Arrowhead Mills Puffed Rice
"My fiance was going to starbucks everyday and spending $4 on a chai coffee or whatever it is. She decided to try this product and she likes it better. And, its a lot less expensive. One container lasts her about a week and its a fraction of the price and buying coffee somewhere.<br /><br />We continue to buy this all the time. TL;DR Great taste and good price"
"My male cat is one of those take it or leave it kinds of cats.  He doesn't overeat or snack if he's not hungry.  The previous treats we used, he liked them but again he could take it or leave it.  These however, he goes nuts over them.  We highly recommend them.  :) TL;DR My male cat goes nuts over these!"
"This is my all time favorite. It is often overlooked because of it's plain packaging and the fact that it does not have a funny name but it is truly one of the greatest hot sauces. It is not hot like ""Dave's"" or ""After Death"" or the other concentrates but it is about as close as you can get and still have really good flavor. It is the hottest sauce that you can find that actually tastes good.  If you are an experienced pepper lover that is tired of novelty sauces that taste like cardboard this is a must try. It is really really hot and really really good! TL;DR Don't let the plain package fool you!"
"While I am really picky when it comes to foods and their quality (not easy for a German in Amerika!), I am really happy to have found this brand on amazon a while ago. Now THIS variety must be new, because we saw it in May for the first time in a local store (for 3.99 a pack, imagine!!!) and shortly after it also appeared available here.<br /><br />It is mildly spicy, very well for european taste (we don't like things toooo hot!), and I love the little Tofu dices (they call it different). The cashews are few, and yes, they are soft, not crunshy. That comes from the simmering, I guess.<br /><br />We eat a pack a person, actually, over Jasmin (or Basmati) rice or Naan, when we find it locally. (I wished I could make Naan myself).<br /><br />A tip for variety: I am preparing different varieties of KOI for each person, and then the plates are exchanged to share. Usually it is just Hubby and me, so I make 2 different packs and we swap the plates after having eaten an half each.<br /><br />We are living on one small income in a low-income state, so we have to watch the money quite much. So I was enthused when I was able to stock up for half the price in June!!! Well, compared to local supermarket stores it was even better ( = less!) than half, as amazon's prices were already lower.<br /><br />I have stocked up really big, my pantry is now filled up with all KOI products for probably 2 or 3 years. Inflation, you can come now, we are ready! Ha! TL;DR The only kind of packaged food I will have!"
"Nothing like the original Bonomo's Turkish Taffy.  Flavor was not the same, the Taffy stuck to the wrapper and I had to peel it off, the Taffy was suppossed to be hard so you could crack it, the new Taffy is very soft. TL;DR Bonomo's NEW Turkish Taffy"
I agree with the other 5* comments..<br /><br />It tastes great in salads as a crouton replacement.  You can also make a powder in coffee grinder..Add it to your favorite cookies for your kids. TL;DR Great Product / Price
"My kids aged 4 and 2 love it, my husband who is the pickiest loves it too(took 2 boxes to keep at work). I dont like cheesy crackers but I eat this by the handful. I think we will use up the 12 pack fairly quickly. We are going at the rate of one box a day. It has been a good mid morning snack or on the go-snack for my kids. I am happy to have come across this brand and the snack.It certainly is guilt-free(whole wheat, no added sugar, real cheese) TL;DR Healthy, tasty, one box treat for kids and adults"
A light squeeze is all you will need of this Mango/Peach - a heavy one results in a drink that will need watering down. The flavor was good for such a non-standard combination. TL;DR Making water interesting
"These are by far the best espresso pods available, I have tried them all. Lavazza has long been known to produce some of the best coffee in Italy. If you like the over roasted, bitter, breath stinking crap they serve at Starbucks, you will not like good espresso like Lavazza. If you appreciate real espresso that creates a strong crema and a smooth taste, these are for you. Those that have been to Italy know what I mean. TL;DR Starbucks??? Really???"
"We have been buying the Earth's Best brand cereal for my son from the very beginning. Though now we use it only to mix in with the runnier jarred foods. 12 boxes will last a LONG time. I think we have gone through not quite 2 boxes in the past 3 months. We also use plain oatmeal, a flavored oatmeak, and a mixed-grain for variety. Your baby might vary but depending on when you switch to finger foods, a 12-pack like this could go to waste. TL;DR Great Cereal"
"Very crisp and tough, does not melt, but  breaks down into pretty large particles in your mouth.  I enjoy it as a cereal, but neither of my 11 mo old twins<br />really enjoy the tough texture.  They like the melt in your mouth and less sugary taste of the happy baby <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXHY8Y"">HAPPYBABY Organic Puffs, Banana Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXM3I0"">HAPPYBABY Organic Puffs, Greens Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> which is almost salty.<br />They also love saltine or ritz crackers Annies brand and those saltines are just as hard to chew and great for teething on. TL;DR Not too great"
These are fabulous and I recommend them to any dog owner who needs a way to get dogs to take medication. TL;DR Best way to give meds to your dog.
"I came across these crackers in a local market and decided to give them a shot. I had tried several other brands of rice crackers (ka-me, sesmark, back to nature), and they all have this distinct burnt rubber after-taste to them that I just cannot swallow. Not these! Diamond's have the most pleasant taste, and are really addicting. When I found these in the market, they were half the price of the other brands I mentioned. Not sure if this applies for all places. TL;DR Gluten Free People Must get these!"
"good stuff,bought this after manager at chilis told me this is what they use to make their mango tea. very good in tea,but also good in smoothies TL;DR monin mango syrup"
I have been using this pancake mix for a couple weeks now and I'm very satisfied. The taste is surprisingly good. Very simple to make and it's a nice change up from oatmeal and eggs every day. TL;DR Satisfied Customer
"After trying this brand's pumpkin pie sugar free syrup, I was amped to try this one! (Especially since that certain chain of coffee places that I am addicted to took their sugar free gingerbread latte off the holiday menu 2 years back)  Anyways after making my latte and being all hyped for the first drink... I was left feel a lil like ehhhhh.  I mean it's not terrible, but it's not what I expected it to be. TL;DR It's ehhh okayyy."
"This is the best price I have found for coconut oil.  I love using this in my cooking. It is so good for you! And you can also use it for your skin, it makes your skin soft when you rub it in, a little greasy for a few minutes, but worth it. TL;DR Best price for Coconut Oil"
I am completlety satisfied with coconut crystal! I use them in my protein smoothie every morning! The taste is a like a mild brown sugar. I am very happy and will be buying more in the future!! TL;DR Great alternative to sugar!! Perfect sweetner for dieters!
"Ever since I discovered this product at a small, independent pet store on the Upper West Side in New York City some years ago, my cats have been wild for it. Of course, the ones who enjoyed it then have long since passed on, but my current five are ecstatic whenever they see me take out the big round container. When I first found it in that pet store (an open container was sitting on a counter), I bought some for a dear friend who lives about 2-3 blocks from the store. When I sent in my six-pack order last month, I knew that I'd have to send me friend one of those packs. Her orange tabby cat is gone now, too, but her new kitten, whom she adopted even though - or perhaps because - he has only one eye, loves Kitty Kaviar as much as all of mine do. Great product. And, I even received an extra container with a similar product, free of charge (and a surprise to me). TL;DR Yum, yum, yum!!! Gimmee some!!! Kitty Kaviar, that is!!!"
"I am new to Indian cooking and came across this spice box.  I received it in 4 days.  I started using the spices immediately because I was so excited.  My first dish was yellow Basmati rice .  It was sooooo good!  I mean if you go by the recipe for the proper amount of spices, then your dishes will be a winner! BUT, most of all these spices are sooo FRESH, and I think they gave a generous amount to use for each of the spices too.  I hope they make future spice boxes to include saffron.  Just a tad bit because I do not want the price to go up too much...lol.  I am very pleased with this spice box.  It is really going to simplify things like taking trips all over the place just to find one spice.  My next dish will be Chicken Korma.  Listen, this spice box is well worth it....get it and ENJOY! TL;DR Beginners, You Need This..."
"I have to watch my sugar intake and a cup of hot chocolate in the evening is a great treat when I'm craving sweets. I also use a Ninja Master Prep that blends ice into a powder, then I add Swiss Miss and water to make a thick chocolate frosty. My daughter's a soda drinker and even with bottled water, she tends to reach for the sugared stuff. Glad to say she likes this as an occasional treat. Sometimes I add strong coffee to the base with a little more sweetener or  Torani sugar free syrup for a quick frappuccino. TL;DR Time-Saver As A Mixer For Other Drinks"
Neuro sleep is amazing. I ordered a 4 different kind pack and only received 3 different I'm very disappointed. None of the trim was included in my pack. I will not order this again. TL;DR sent wrong product
"I have a small theater style popcorn maker in my home-theater room. This popcorn is well measured and tastes great. All that being said, I am guessing it is not very healthy. We do not live on this product. What could taste so good and be healthy anyway. My only complaint is that the popping is so rigorous that I do get quite a few unpopped kernals that fly from the kettle. But with the old-maid holes in the floor, its a small price to pay for such a great product. TL;DR Awesome popcorn"
"THese are small enough not to over power you, but big enough to give you a burst of cinnamon and freshen your breath.  I rarely could find these at gas stations/stores in this size.  I love the small size for I carry the tin in my pocket.  A great product.  Shipped promptly. TL;DR ""Sweet"" Candy"
"This Fruit Dip Peach Passion Mix is Awsome!!! It was the hit of the get together I had with my friends a few afternoons ago. Just mix with Sour Cream, or Sour Cream and Cream Cheese and serve with fruits in season. I used Strawberries, Peach and Nectarine Slices and Rasberries. Make certain that you mix it up and let it sit in the refrigerator at least an hour prior to serving so the flavors can mingle. It is that simple. Then you too can be the hostess of the hour!!!WOW. Am I glad I found this!!!<br /><br />I put it together very quickly...it only took 5 or 10 minutes to find a fancy bowl and serving plate. Then, I mixed up the dip using half Sour Cream and half whipped cream cheese. It only took one cup of each. I made it up the night before because I wanted to be absolutely certain the flavors mingled and mixed as much as possible. I stored it overnight in Tupperware, then the next day popped the dip into a beautiful cut glass dish. I put that in the middle of a large decorative, serving plate and surrounded the cut glass dish with fruit. Every single person commented on how good this was.<br /><br />It is quick, not expensive, and looks really pretty. If you are the artistic type, I imagine you could decorate or garnish this dip (the photo on the package shows it decorated with mint leaves) and make it look really smashing.<br /><br />I have already ordered more and plan to keep this flavor, or some flavor appropriate to the season, on hand at all time. It has become an instant staple in my pantry. Give it a try and I think that you too, will become an instant ""star hostess"", and will keep it on your pantry shelves. This was an absolute blessing of a find. Hope you enjoy it nearly as much as I and my friends have!!!!! TL;DR THE HIT OF THE LADIES GET TOGETHER"
"Okay, I have tried several of this company's products and they are fair.  However, this one was shockingly bad.  The flavor was not just bland.  It was repulsive.  It was disturbing to imagine this is something people actually enjoy. I have given up on it.  I have decided to not eat the other cans.  I cannot in good faith give it to others. TL;DR Buyer beware"
"Great product but Amazon has these way too expensive.  You can get a 5 ounce bags at Kmart or Walmart for $0.99 per back which 5 lbs translates to $16.00.  For $2.00 more for 5 pounds, I'd rather have small convienient bags.  But these are by far the best gummi's out there! TL;DR Awesome Taste, High Amazon Price"
"I bought these a few months ago in a grocery store out of state.  Disappointed I could not find them near where I lived, I was delighted to find them on Amazon.  Now, I order them a dozen bags at a time and have to ration myself so I don't eat them all in a few days.  They're delicious, very crispy (which I love) and healthier than other snacks I used to eat (e.g., potato chips).  I love them with salsa or hummus.  That they're gluten free is an added benefit.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WQPGYE"">Mediterranean Snacks Sea Salt Baked Lentil Chips 4.5-ounce (Pack of 12)</a> TL;DR I love these chips!"
"I am a lover of all things coconut.  Milk, water, oil, flesh and now butter!  This coconut butter is actually a lot like coconut oil, in that it contains coconut oil plus flesh, which makes it a soft, buttery spreadable condiment.  While this jar is sitting on my counter it's about 85-90 degrees during the day and since I've had it it's remained soft and oily (coconut oil/butter hardens when cold) and I've had to stir it in order to get the thicker fleshy part mixed in with the oil that rises to the surface.  I use it to spread on whole grain toast, I put a spoonfull in fruit smoothies, have put the oil on my hair and face and take a spoonfull at night before I go to sleep.  Coconut has many benefits, and Artisana Coconut butter is raw/organic and is a great value. TL;DR Coconut Lovers Rejoice!"
"I just bottled this wine. It stated it was a full 6 gallons. In order to get 6 gallons, I needed to top off with better than a gallon of water. I thought that would dilute the wine too much, so I racked it into a 5 gallon carboy and proceeded from there. I did add oak chips during the fermenting process.<br /><br />The end result, this wine is great. When I asked my wife what she thought, she said this is going to be really big. I'll cellar it, but I don't think it will last long. I'd defintely do another one of these.<br /><br />Since I didn't get the full six gallons - therefore 4 stars. TL;DR Argentinian Malbac"
This is good and it arrived really fast. However the chicken apple sausage is a little better than this kind TL;DR Good
"This is a great tasting cereal.  It has a lasting crunch and the whole family loves it.  This price is not good at all.  You can find a larger size for a cheaper price at Costco. TL;DR great cereal, not so good price"
"This xylitol product is a real surprise, if you don't mind eating tree bark. It tastes, looks like, cooks, bakes, dissolves, etc. as well as sugar. I have been using it for the past couple months. Best banana/cranberry/nut bread ever.For people who are borderline diabetic and are trying to avoid becoming diabetic as well as those who are diabetic, this is the sugar substitute. It actually can stand on its own, and not be a ""substitute."" Also, there is no metallic aftertaste that other sugar substitutes have. TL;DR Better (for health) than sugar"
"I bought this Marzipan to use at my daughters' wedding.  It was so dry and hard that it took me a long time to get it out of the can.  I tried to knead it, but was only able to knead the very center portion as the rest was so dry and hard that I could not move it. I tasted it and had to spit it out. It was horrible. I had a friend, who is a professional baker, look at it and taste it.  She had to spit it out, as well.  It just was not edible and I was not able to use it. I had to throw the entire can in the garbage and come up with a replacement at the last minute.  I would never waste my money on this again. I do not recommend anyone buy this product. I love marzipan, but this was horrible. TL;DR the worst marzipan ever"
"not only is this a quality, delicious product, but its very convenient as well. typically acai needs to be kept frozen but i like the fact that sambazon has developed a shelf stable easy to use powder. sometime i mix with other fruit juices instead of water. a recent combo i tried was with the vita coco pure coco water. i left energized and hydrated. TL;DR quality product"
"I bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it's not everyday.  It also comes in handy when guests come over, because we don't tend to keep coffee in the house.<br /><br />Each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket, briefcase or travel bag.  The flavor was rich and at around $1.00 a cup, much cheaper than going to Starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work.<br /><br />It dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue.  He first tried it in a 12 ounce mug and found it to be a little strong, but was perfect in his 20 ounce travel mug.<br /><br />[...] TL;DR Convenient and Tasty"
"I purchased these for my adopted soldier serving in Iraq.  I've had other banana chips that have had additives, etc.  These are the best I've ever eaten!!  (yes, I had to try a package before mailing them off).  I'm going to look for other varieties for my next box.  These deserve more than 5 stars! TL;DR So Delicious!!"
"It's not an amazing tea. It's an ""okay"" tea. I buy regular green tea at asia market for way cheaper price and I get same result. I look for saving money. Will not repurchase. TL;DR Will not repurchase"
I bought this item from Hmart last month. It was on sale 99cent a bowl (full price is 2.99). The broth is so good and the noodle is fresh and soft. Today Hmart has it on sale again. 12 bowls for 11.99 (full price is 29.99). I bought them right away. TL;DR best noodle
"This Twisted Fruit is billed as a healthier alternative to other snacks targeted at kids.  This snack boasts one serving of fruit, a good source of vitamins C and B, and tastes almost as good as a less healthy alternative although the strawberry has almost a more grape taste than strawberry.  It also says it is fun it untwist and eat but it really isn't that easy to untwist and the snack itself is a little greasy to hold and you will be reaching to wipe your hands after eating.  Plus the snack does get caught in your teeth like other snacks of its ilk.  But the organic make up and the fact it does leave kids fairly full, adults may want two or more to be satisfied, makes this a much better alternative to the sugar snacks that currently flood the market. TL;DR Chewy Goodness"
"This cereal has been great for me as I've had to avoid sugar for about 6 weeks. The cereal is sweetened with brown rice syrup, and has a good rice taste to it. The shipping of this item was VERY fast. TL;DR Good Product, fast shipping"
"This was a gift for my boyfriend. He describes opening the ""can"" as ""like opening a bag of popcorn without the fumes and possibility of popcorn lung"". He also says that they are sweet, and cautions trying to eat too many at once. :) TL;DR Great gift..."
"I've used this mix for both cake and Snickerdoodle cookies. While the cookies were good, they don't compare with the cake. The cake is moist and buttery and I couldn't even tell it was gluten-free. My gluten-free 2 yr old gobbled the cake up, both with and even without frosting. What a treat! I'll definately buy this one again! TL;DR Gluten-Free Pantry Old Fashioned Cake and Cookie Mix"
"I love that this is a mixed grain hot cereal rather than plain oatmeal..it add dimension and chewiness to have multiple grains.  It's lightly sweet, with a mild maple flavor.  No artificial ""maple"" flavor here.<br /><br />The portion size is great...equivalent to 2 ""packets"" of instant oatmeal in a regular supermarket.<br /><br />Excellent to stow in a bag for breakfast at the office. Very convenient, just add boiling water and steep 5 minutes, or add water first and then microwave in the cup. TL;DR Delcious, plentiful, nutritious"
"We love the lucuma powder from Navita's Naturals. I use it to make this fantastic batter for gluten-free spelt pancakes:<br /><br />2 C Spelt Flour<br />1/4 C Navita's Naturals Lucuma Powder<br />1 T Baking Powder<br />3/4 t Himalayan Sea Salt<br />2 T Coconut Sugar<br />2 T Butter (melted)<br />2 C Almond Milk (or Soy Milk, Milk etc)<br />1 T Vanilla<br />Add ins:  We used Trader Joe's Dried Blueberries, Shredded Coconut, Pecans<br /><br />Blend first 5 dry ingredients and then add the melted butter, vanilla and almond milk.<br /><br />Yumm! TL;DR Spelt Pancakes with Lucuma!"
"Hi, my name's Kat and I'm a coffee snob. We love this coffee. It has such a smooth taste. We do not like burnt-tasting coffee. To us, Starbucks and many others claiming a ""bold"" flavor are just over-roasted until they are charred. We love a strong, smooth, mildly roasted coffee. Coffee that is just toasted, not overdone. To give you a good comparison, this coffee is similar in taste, smoothness and richness to Dunkin Donuts Original whole bean, Pilon from Dominican Republic, Breakfast Blend (not House Blend), From Africa to Africa, and Brazil (all three ""mild roast"" from Starbucks), Magnum Jamaica Blue Mountain Blend, Land of a Thousand Hill's Rwandan Blend hand-picked, and Tim Horton's.<br /><br />The best thing about Cameron's Breakfast Blend is the taste! Add to that: Organic, Shade-grown, Rain Forest Alliance Certified, Fair Trade AND the price! With Subscribe and Save, it costs under 6 bucks a bag. You can't find another coffee with all that going for it! We LOVE it! Remember, though, if you like bold 'n burnt as in MOST of Starbucks coffees, this is NOT even similar... Enjoy your coffee!<br /><br />FEB 2012: Update. We've been drinking Cameron's Organic Woods and Water (whole beans) and it's even better than the Breakfast Blend! Wow! Enjoy! The only sad part is how expensive it's become in only a year, even with ""Subscribe and Save"" prices. It's gone from under $6 a bag to over $10 a bag! That being said, we still order it and love it. TL;DR Delicious, smooth coffee!"
"The Starkist Chunk Light Tuna packed in *oil* has a superior, fresh flavor, not greasy, with just the right amount of salt.  The texture is firm and, unlike canned tuna, there is actually tuna in this pouch.  A 7-oz pouch of tuna has more tuna than two 6-ounce cans (which are about half water or oil).  I highly recommend you try this. TL;DR This tuna is terrific!!!"
"First of all, I LOVE strong, smooth coffee.  I had previously enjoyed the Illy dark roast espresso, and I thought that a lighter roast might be healthier, since it is roasted with less heat/ time.  I tried this and was not disappointed.  Do I prefer it to the dark (?); I have not decided, but it is equally tasty when made on my stove top percolator.  Increasingly, I am shopping based on ethics AND value, so if anyone knows of an organic coffee as good as this, please post! TL;DR For flavor, it is the best I have tried"
"I really wanted to like this coffee but it was bland and did not remind me of any French Roast I've ever had. It was smooth.  We put in our solofil K cups and think the grind was too fine for the machine. TL;DR Husband says it is not very ""Frenchy""."
"AMAZON ORDER: Ordered the 3 pack Verona after reading + reviews AND bec. I wanted to start ordering as many non-perishible items as possible on-line.<br />I have no gripes w/ the Verona (it's nothin' special) BUT I was disappointed in ordering THREE bags in Jan. & they arrive w/ a ""good by"" date of April. That's waayyy tooo close.<br />Just doesn't sound fresh enough to me. I felt like they took advantage of an on-line orderer to send the dregs to. Oh well, live & learn. TL;DR Bad ""good by"" date"
"I asked my nephew's wife and their 6 month old for help with this review, because I was not going to eat this at rate it!  She said,<br /><br />""This is one of the first ""solid"" foods my 6 month old has tried, and she absolutely loves it.  I didn't taste any myself, but my little one almost convinced me to take a bite.  She is always ready with an open mouth when this is on the spoon.  I served it at room temperature.  In general, this meal has definitely been her favorite of the veggies and fruits she has tried.<br /><br />As a mother, I love the convenient packaging.  The squeezable pouch and twist-off cap make dispensing the food very easy.  The cap on the pouch is re-sealable, which is great for storage or traveling.  This brand is less messy to open/close than other brands I have tried.  I also love that this food is 100% organic, has no fillers, and the packaging is BPA free.<br /><br />What great peace of mind to know you're feeding your baby the best!""<br /><br />Thank you Erin and Lilly! TL;DR Baby and Mommy Favorite"
"This stuff is delicious, has substituted perfectly in all the recipes I've used it in and I definitely don't react to it as I do to cane or beet sugars.  Made the most awesome coconut macaroons ever!<br />There is a danger that you will want to make too many goodies though! TL;DR Yum!"
"I live on a remote Island in Alaska and stumbled on this black gold.  We use pepper like most, but also need it for smoking salmon, seasoning game meats and just making sure our burgers taste decent.  I grow many of my green spices (oregano, basil, chives....etc) but must rely on the local grocer for my other spices.  This pepper has real kick, advise you use it sparingly, but frequently.  It's truly good.  I like it so much that I'll gift it this Christmas to friends who enjoy the real art of cooking, and thought to check Amazon for availability......not terribly surprised to find on their site, but surprised to see I pay 3 dollars less here in Alaska.  No matter, I'll still shop them (Amazon) for gifting this wonderful pepper, but take serious note on pricing disparities.  No matter where you shop this, buy some, check it out and judge for yourself.  I really think you'll appreciate the kick this particular spice provides.  Sadly only only 5 reviews as I type this, but all are 5 star, and so mine as well.  Give it a shot, and take a few minutes to input your thoughts...it's one of the reasons we shop here.....and no, I'm employed in the military, not Amazon.  Take care all, spread a smile wherever you are...it actually matters. And use spices in your cooking! TL;DR Pepper Worth a Gift"
"Love these!! The perfect size mint, in the awesome Altoids Tin.  I use these for dry mouth.  And since their sugar free, no calories to worry about. A+ TL;DR Best mini mints ever!"
I ordered these for the family so they could have a familiar taste from home.  They were so excited.  This product was fresh so I was very pleased. TL;DR Very Pleased
"These came in the variety pack <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AZ2ECY"">Gourmet Basics Smart Fries 6-Flavor Variety Pak, 1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>, and out of the six were my least favorite.  The fries were a nice crunch and puffy texture as with all the others.  The sharp, salty cheddar flavor was good.  However, the flavoring was too weak for my taste, especially when compared to the other varieties in the assortment. TL;DR Good texture and taste, but could be much better"
"tastes good, but a little on the sweet side.  may not be for everyone. TL;DR sweet but tasty"
"I used this repellent at the end of May in Louisiana. My friends got bitten profusely, and I didn't even have a scratch.<br /><br />I get bitten a lot and also am allergic to bites, so am always looking for something strong enough to protect me.<br /><br />This product actually smells quite pleasant, is a cream so does not dry out your skin, and 100% actually works. I also didn't have to reapply once I'd put it on in the evenings.<br /><br />I would say it doesn't last too long as it's quite a small bottle, but it can probably be put on more sparsely than I did. TL;DR Great!"
this makes being bit during a pilling session obsolete! and you dont have to get your fingers all slimy giving fido that nasty medicine either! TL;DR LOVE!
Fits the Torani 25.4 oz bottles perfectly. Ball bearings ensure you get the right amount of syrup in each pump. TL;DR Fits Torani 25.4 oz Bottles
This cake mix is moist with chocolate surprise morsels inside.  Finally I found a cake that my non-allergic family and friends enjoy and request that I make.  Our son has multiple food allergies and finally we've found a  company that meets his needs.  Thank you Cherrybrook Kitchen. TL;DR Great Food for even Non-allergic families
Easily the next best thing to drinking straight from young coconuts. I was curious because I've never had coconut juice that includes pulp and now I don't think I can go back to pulpless. TL;DR Yum
"I was so excited when our local Whole Foods got these in stock but turns out my 2 yr old wont eat them - I tasted them myself and they have no taste - kinda gross!  I threw the bag away =(<br />Also, whole foods sells them for $6 a bag - amazon sells them for $10 - buy local if you can!! TL;DR Not very tasty"
these are good :P it reminds me of lucky charms  marshmallows this is a good poptart a must try :D TL;DR these are good :D
This product is no longer available in the area where my daughter lives and she misses this cracker and is always commenting about how much she likes and misses them.  I ordered these as a gift for her for Christmas because I know they will be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />These are some of the best tasting cheese crackers around and make a wonderful snack by themselves or with dip or even a bowl of soup.  The light crispy texture and robust taste are great. TL;DR I love my daughter
I am so thankful Amazon was able to get this cocoa for me.  They don't care this Nestle Product in any sotre from Michigan to Florida.<br /><br />I love 3 tablespoons in my coffee every morning.<br /><br />Thanks Nestle TL;DR Happy
"We love this versatile and savory spice blend, but we're disappointed when the packaged arrived to find that both containers were damaged and leaking in the box. TL;DR Great spice, damaged in delivery"
I have subsribed to the monthly shipment of Greenies 27 oz canister teenie 96 count product and each month the price increases.  If i sign up today the price drops to $19.94.  Why the increase?  Seems like they lock you in for a scheduled order and then take advantage of you hoping that you won't notice the price increases.<br /><br />The product is great and my dogs love them but the business practice of the price hikes is terrible. TL;DR Why do they increase the price each month on the product?
"This is probably the worst coffee I have ever had.  It arrived stale, odorless, a bag of lifeless beans.  It had absolutely no coffee smell when I opened the bag.  I always grind my coffee fresh on the spot and there was no aroma from the ground beans - bad sign.  The brewed product was equally lifeless - worse than ground Folgers from a can.  I returned it after the first cup. My bad for ordering such a large bag but I have have had good luck with organic coffee and this seemed like a good deal.  Bland, bland, dead stuff. Maybe other reviewers received a fresh product - I don't see how anyone who enjoys coffee could like this stuff in the condition received by me. TL;DR Horrible stuff"
"I loved the General Foods International Chai Latte (sugar free).  But since it has been discontinued, I haven't really found anything I really like.  Now Maxwell House has produced the Coffee Chai Latte (not sugar free).  It is OK, but I miss the GF chai (sugar free).  I am hoping that Maxwell House will come out with the Chai Coffee (or Tea) Latte in sugar free and then I will try it again.  I am also disappointed in the other Maxwell House line of coffees.  They are very weak in flavor.  I have tried the David Rio Orca Spice Chai Tea (sugar free) and it is OK a little sweet for me, but better than nothing. TL;DR Not as good as the General Foods International Chai Latte Tea (sugar free)"
"I love this tea, and most stash teas.  This flavor I really enjoy iced and have only made 3 bags hot out of my 100 pack, which is now gone.  Just a great refreshing tea overall, especially iced on a hot summer day. TL;DR Very Good Tea"
"After feeding this food one week, I could clearly see the improvement on my dogs.  I witnessed beautiful coat and nice muscle builded up.  Plus the smell of this food is excellent.  More than anything, this quality food turns my dogs energy level up pretty obviously. TL;DR The best food ever"
"I love these Fuji Apple Crisps.... the taste is amazing.. they are the real thing, no doubt about it. A nice healthy snack that satisfies that craving for something sweet. I am doing Weight Watchers and this is a 0 point treat.  Love them !!!!! TL;DR The Real Thing !!!"
"These bags are fine, with one caveat:  if the bag is for kitchen garbage that will sit for a while, it may start decomposing in the can!  Normally this is not a problem for me, because I put all the food waste into a stainless compost can to put in the compost bin.  But my husband dumped the coffee grinds in this morning and it was already wet underneath the bag.  I had to throw it out and start over. TL;DR The only compostable bag that I know of."
"Lola loves them! Healthy and delicious treats, shipped out on time, arrived packaged well and my dog loved them! I'm happy I tried these new treats! TL;DR Lola approves!"
6 out of the 12 cans are very dented!  Very disappointed.  Please send me 6 more!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was a gift. TL;DR dented cans!!!!
My 10 month old took one bite made a face and refused the rest. She eats anything. I tried it and so did my husband. It tasted like potting soil and has a very bitter after taste. I feel like some of the veggies are not cooked long enough and thats why its bitter. TL;DR Yuck!
"Butter rum has always been my favorite Life Saver flavor. I don't know why they are so difficult to find around town, but I am glad Amazon is selling them in bulk. I ended up getting them much cheaper than I usually do, when I am lucky enough to see them for sale in an airport. TL;DR Love these!"
"Out of all the chew toys I've bought, these get the best reviews. My dogs have almost forgotten that they have other chew toys or even stuffed animals, for that matter. They are soooo obsessed with these dinos, I've already purchased more! TL;DR My dogs love these!!!"
"Caramel Apple Pops is simply the best candy ever created. The flavor is both sweet and tart and the flat shape makes each piece of candy truly unique. I buy these pops year-round. The only problem is that if you order them online- shipping is very expensive.<br />* These will melt (it has caramel on the outside), make sure if you are having them shipped that they pack the box according to the weather as most good shippers will do anyways. TL;DR Best Candy Ever"
"This is the very best meal replacement shake that I've ever found. All 3 flavors are great and the ingredients are fabulous. Get it really cold, shake it really good...and enjoy! TL;DR Yummy and Healthy too...what more could a person want?"
"When it's right around the end of the day at the office and I need a little pick-me-up, I usually try to eat a piece of fruit to get the natural sugar rush.  When fruit is not available, I reach for these fruit nuggets and they do the trick.  They totally satisfy my need for something sweet and I don't get the nasty sugar crash that I normally get from candy.  They come in the perfect amount and yield only 50 calories.  My local grocery store caries the 24-pk variety box and they last quite a while.  They can sometimes be hard to find, so I'm really glad to see that I can order them from Amazon. TL;DR Excellent Afternoon Office Snack"
"The strawberry is undoubtedly the best flavor of sour punch straws. Sadly, they don't seem to sell them anywhere in my new town, so I decided to buy in bulk and have them shipped.  Shipping was awesome, received it within 2 days.<br /><br />If you are a sour punch straw junkie like me, you can't go wrong ordering this product. TL;DR Favorite Candy, Fast Shipping"
The Hodgson yolkless whole wheat noodles hold their shape and provide great taste to traditional noodle recipes. TL;DR great chicken noodle soup
"But it doesn't stop there.  This is great on eggs, vegetables and any other type of meat.  And to think I found this little gem while searching for my favorite Christmas music.  What a stroke of luck; their seasonings are as good as their music!<br /><br />I like this slightly better than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HKLMM8"">Grilling Salt</a> because this tastes slightly saltier, without being too salty.  Try both to see which is your favorite; I don't think you can go wrong with either of these delicious seasonings! TL;DR My favorite steak rub!"
"I've been using white truffle oil as a healthy alternative to butter for about a year. I also like to buy organic products. This product has the delightful mild flavor of a fine Italian white truffle oil, with the added benefit of being organic. I use it to heat up rice, cook fresh or frozen vegetables and it's great on popcorn. Fortunately, because of its high cost, a little bit goes a long way. Once you open it, be sure and keep it refrigerated as it will spoil quickly. refrigerating will cause it to thicken but that's easily resolved by microwaving it for 20 seconds or putting the closed bottle in hot water. If you microwave it, be sure and cut off the little metal ring that the is the bottom of the bottle cap. It's easily removed with scissors. I also, for environmental reasons, like that it's packaged in glass and not plastic. For some ideas on how to use truffle oil you may want to check out the book ""Truffles: Ultimate Luxury, Everyday Pleasure <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E97X0M"">Truffles: Ultimate Luxury, Everyday Pleasure</a> by Rosario Safina, the owner of the company that makes this particular truffle oil. I've not read the book or even looked at it but it's been reviewed byt 12 people at Amazon and ten people gave it five stars. The two people that gave it a bad review can be considered as outliers. One reviewer gave the book one star because he or she never got it from Amazon. That's a merchant complaint and not a product complaint. The other negative review stated that there were spelling and typographical errors and that was the sole purpose for the bad review. The ten remaining reviewers all give the book five stars so it's probably worth looking into if you're looking for ideas as to how to use truffle oil in a wider range of recipes. TL;DR Wonderful but pricey"
I love the convenient size of this prune juice. They are the right size for an individual serving. I use prune juice as a substitute for laxatives and find it excellent and natural. It does not hurt that I like prune juice a lot also -- it is a great medicinal product. I also like stewed prunes -- I hope this product will stay in stock. TL;DR Love the convenient Size
Order did not arrived on time and 10 days after that I contacted the seller since the tracking said the order was still in Washington.  The seller replied to my email and asked for a few days to contact the post office; they notified me that the post office could not find the order and did not know what had happened to it.  Best Asian Grocers resent the order to me and it arrived within a weeks time.  They were very helpful and courteous.  I would definitely deal with them again. TL;DR Best Asian Grocer - Shaosing Rice Wine
I have already put in an order for another shipment of this great stuff!  I buy all of the products for my bath bombs in bulk but the citric acid is most definitely the hardest to get for a good price!  Glad I found this.  Especially since it is on Amazon Prime! TL;DR Perfect for my Bath bombs!
this wasabi was hot and fresh.  i like there that are no colorings or preservatives.  i also like the small can.  unused portion stays fresher and can is very useful after the product is gone. TL;DR super!
"I must admit that I'm not a tea connoisseur, but this herbal tea was a nice change of pace from my usual chai, black, or green tea I buy at the grocery store. I first had this tea at a conference, and it was excellent. I liked how it had a sweet taste, without feeling too sugary. The pyramid teabag made for a quick, yet even steeping. I have no idea was honeybush is, but I like it. The foil bags are also very nice, because I believe it will help the teas keep their flavor and make them last longer. (The lasting longer is really important, since I just bought 120 tea bags...) It was also nice that it was a caffeine free tea, which is not always easy to find. TL;DR A tasty, caffeine free tea"
Sometimes when I am feeling a little too skinny (a joke people) I will buy a box and eat it in front of my sister who is always on a diet. NAUGHTY!!!!! TL;DR Make up a holiday and celebrate whenever!!
What a refreshing tasting beverage...Unlike anything I have tasted before....The juice and carbonation mix great together... TL;DR Fantastic Beverage
"This Higgins & Burke tea is pretty tasty.  The Lemon Balm, Lemon Grass, and Verbena work well with the green tea, taking away the 'dry' aspects of green tea and making it a bit more 'green leafy' and lemony.<br /><br />I liked it as-is.  Then again, I generally don't add anything to any green tea.  Not sweetener nor milk.<br /><br />I think you're more likely to like this Green Tea mix if you don't set your tastebuds for straight green tea as the overall flavor is radically different.  But if you are looking for something really pleasant to have after dinner, or along with a snack, this might be the thing.<br /><br />Pam T~ TL;DR This is Nice..."
I sent these to my grandson for a snack......he loved them.  I will send him more for sure.<br />I like to send him a surprise once in a while. TL;DR VERY GOOD.....
"I am always amazed by wild rice, which is actually not real rice. the package arrived soon, but i haven't cooked it yet. TL;DR fast shipping"
I like the product.  The noodles are as advertised but too expensive.  You can get it much cheaper from the Miracle Noodle Co. TL;DR Miracle Noodles.
"Wonderful, fresh<br />Doesn't expire til 2013<br />So glad we could find this product as no longer carried in Florida grocery stores TL;DR Healthy Cereal"
Possibly the best candy I have ever had. The only drawback is I can't stop eating them. TL;DR The best of the best
"Sharp orange flavor with a tolerable spearmint taste. I've tried many of the less expensive brands and haven't liked any other except this one and Good Seasons Tuscany. I'm not crazy about all of the Tazo drinks, but this one is nice. I love drinking this tea with chocolate. It comes in an orange package. You can also smell the other spices. Don't make the mistake I make, by adding too much water. As with many products, amazon is over charging. TL;DR Good orange flavor"
"I am an avid herbal tea drinker and must say that I absolutely love Davidson's tea. The quality is great, it is organic and the favors are delicious! When I saw the other reviews I knew I had to put my two cents in because I completely love this company and it's products. The dessert teas are my favorite. They are a perfect treat without guilt. I know I often use these reviews to help determine what I am going to buy on Amazon. I think this is a great buy and I would highly recommend it. TL;DR Davidson's Tea is the best!"
"I really like everything about the product, even though it is a trifle ""rich"" for my digestion, so I don't eat it as often as the rice dishes. However, like the other ""sides"" dishes, it is easily and quickly prepared, stores nicely, and am glad it's also on the ""subscribe & save"" list. Will continue to purchase it. TL;DR Just a little rich. . ."
"Chocolate is by definition a Good Thing, dark chocolate doubly so.  And organic, Rainforest Alliance Certified dark chocolate?  Very nice.  It has a good flavor.  At 54% cocoa, it's not nearly as dark as some of the other bars on the market, and so is rather smooth on the tongue (I will dispute that it's waxy as one reviewer reported.)  It's true that it's not silky the way really fine chocolate is, but it doesn't purport to be.  It's the sort of chocolate you could find at your local supermarket.  High end there, but nowhere near the price or quality of a bar of Vosges organic dark chocolate.  Nor should it be compared to something like Vosges or even Godiva.  It's a good, affordable organic chocolate bar that has some good credentials in the environmental department.<br /><br />The bar is smallish, but I also debate the assertion that it's too small to share with a friend.  There are six good-size squares in this package, which are more than enough for two assuming that no one is being a glutton.  (That said, I admit I ate the whole bar myself today, but if there'd been anyone else here I'd have shared.)  Yeah, more is better when it comes to chocolate, but it's by no means necessary.<br /><br />Enjoy this chocolate bar for what it is. TL;DR Good noms"
Our cat will not eat any treat on the market except this one.  Thank goodness the price is reasonable.  Our cat has allergies and this is one treat that she can digest. TL;DR Good Eats
"I've always loved the people that make Sriracha. Actually I have 2 bottles sitting in my room.. anyways, I tried this and it's amazing! It's not too hot (unless you put tons on your food) and it has a nice subtle flavor. Then again I love all hot sauce (except tobasco and similar brands). I would highly recommend this to hot sauce lovers(: TL;DR Delicious and versatile"
"Great crystallized ginger; fresh, long-lasting, wonderful flavor.<br />We have ordered from Angela's many times and have always been pleased.<br />Always ships on time and always has the best price. TL;DR Best Ginger, Best Price"
"This dinner kit was not at all what I was expecting, was poor in quality, and overly complicated with four separate packages to mix together.  It does, however only take 20 minutes to make, but at the end of it, I found it inedible.  I had somewhat realistic expectations that you weren't going to get broccoli out of a box so had some fresh broccoli on hand.  I'm glad I did, because the separate broccoli packet that came with this dinner kit was essentially smashed broccoli dust.  There's a separate packet for seasoning and for pasta as well, but you add them at the same time.  I couldn't help but wonder why the pasta and seasoning wouldn't be in one packet, but I guess they felt it necessary and more costly.  The pasta was also not what I was expecting.  For some reason I was thinking it would be a substantial pasta, but it was actually orzo that ended up looking and tasting more like rice than pasta.  The last packet was the velveeta cheese packet which looked rich and creamy, but when combined with all the other ingredients, ended up resulting in a slightly sweet chemical taste.  I took a couple of bites and really didn't like it all.  My dogs were not so discerning, but for a family meal, it tastes overprocessed and isn't better than plain macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />If you're going to go through the trouble of making chicken and broccoli with cheese, you could probably add real chicken and broccoli to standard mac and cheese and do much better than this. TL;DR The dogs loved it, me not so much"
"If you are making brownies, this cocoa is far superior to any other brand.  Also great for making hot chocolate. TL;DR The best cocoa for making brownies"
These nuts have a great taste!  I shared with friends and we all liked them a lot. Will buy this brand again. TL;DR Great Taste!
"I am ordering more, this coffee so much better then the pods you buy at the store. No plastic after taste. TL;DR good coffee"
"Well, not actually naked... a little touch of sea salt. I was looking for some almonds that were not processed with corn or soybean oil (very bad stuff btw) and didn't include a long list of ingredients that I couldn't pronounce. These fit the bill... Warning though... one bag might become a single serving! My wife and I limit ourselves to three bags per month! They are delicious, always fresh and contain just two ingredients: almonds and sea salt. Highly recommended! TL;DR Natural, naked, hard to resist!"
"This is the most acidic tomato sauce I've ever used. It's almost as tart as a lemon. I put it in an old family lasagne recipe, but neglected to taste it at first. By then it was too late.  I tried to soften the astringent taste with sugar and sauteed mushrooms, but this was only partially successful. The only thing that saved the dish were copious amounts of Bechamel sauce in the layering. They claim they use only Roma tomatoes, but I'm doubtful. I can't imagine any recipe that would benefit from this sauce. TL;DR Unacceptably acidic"
2/4 of my cats like to chew on string and well they chewed it to death a little while after I got it.The squeak the mouse makes almost sounds like a real mouse.Kind of cheap but my cats liked it. TL;DR My cats enjoyed this while it lasted.
"These ""flying saucer"" candies take me back to my childhood.  One of my all-time favorites.  They taste just as good as I remember and the best thing is they are shipped automatically to my house!  My kids love them too!  They are very hard to find in retail stores - especially at this price.  Keep them coming!  An added bonus - a whole bag is relatively low in calories, so us dieters can have a treat without feeling guilty! TL;DR The Very Best!"
"As a frequent buyer of Sea's Gift Roasted Seaweed Snack wasabi flavor, this seaweed had an appealing price so I thought I'd try it. However, I was quite disappointed with the flavor once I tried it. I have 99 packs remaining and hope to find someone who I can give them to. TL;DR If you've never had seaweed snacks before, you might enjoy this."
"I like spicy food, but usually avoid <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R6HC2A"">Tabasco</a>-like hot sauce because it tastes like I poured vinegar over my food.<br /><br />Tapatio is not made with vinegar. As a result, the hot sauce adds flavor instead of taking away.<br /><br />In fact, it may taste too good. The heat has a way of sneaking up on you. I'd say it is about as hot as Tabasco, but you won't notice the heat at first.<br /><br />Tapatio is hands down the best hot-sauce available and I use to to add flavor to everything from pizza to spaghetti to mac and cheese. TL;DR The absolute best hot sauce available"
"When we get very busy in our home, I like this sausage a lot for quick meal options. The flavor is a bit sweet, and works well with lots of types of vegetables. Usually I'll slice it lengthwise and saute it until done, then add sweet potatoes,potatoes and onions to the pan to make up a skillet. With a bit of cheese on top it's all the food groups in a one pan meal that my family enjoys. Mac and cheese with peas and sausage mixed in is another option that my daughter is crazy for. For that I cut the sausage into coins and cook it up, then make up the homemade mac and cheese as usual, add frozen peas and the sausage and finish cooking. The sweetness of the sausage with the salty of the cheese is good and it's just so easy to make. TL;DR A favorite quick meal solution"
I ordered these Lorna Doone 100 calorie cookies from amazon because they can not keep them on the shelves at any grocery store around my area. I even called a friend 45 miles away and he couldnt find them either. You should try them. They taste great without the extra junk in them.  My kids love them 2 :) TL;DR These cookies are great
"and it's much cheaper to buy in bulk through Amazon, than through their coffee club or website.  With a big enough order, shipping is free! TL;DR I'm a committed Community Coffee girl, . . ."
"Great size to take for travel, car rides, camping, to work etc. when you want a quick and healthy breakfast on the go. Good, slightly sweet taste and tons of fiber! TL;DR Good size for travel"
"Of all the Golazo products, the Mango - Limon is definitely the best!!! Unlike other energy drinks, the flavor on this one is actually awesome! TL;DR Mango - Limon!!!!"
My family is Hooked on this coffee!!!  I purchased a case and put them in (my adult kids) Easter Baskets this year. TL;DR YUMMY!!!
"I am very impressed with this black tea. I used to work in a specialty coffee and tea shop and I know for a fact that they spent much more for tea of this same caliber. The bag does seal tight and I just do my best to get all the air out and it stays fresh. I was a bit skeptical given the price, but I will be singing the praises of Davidson's Tea to anyone who will listen! TL;DR Very Impressed!"
".<br /><br />Recently on a relaxing vacation, I discovered that I had neglected to bring my favorite coffee.  Although I usually avoid buying coffee in a supermarket, I was stuck.  So I shopped a local grocery store to purchase enough coffee for my vacation.  I looked for a Kona blend with a higher percentage Kona than I usually find without luck.  Then I spotted this Starbucks blend that I have seen advertized and decided to try it.<br /><br />Starbucks Blonde Veranda coffee is a light roast coffee that is advertized as having lighter body and mellow favors.  Starbucks claims that roasting for less time frees ""nuances"" of cocoa and toasted nuts.<br /><br />Not as sharp and energetic as my favorite dark roasts, yet still flavorful.  Blonde Veranda Blend is soft and gentle like cool drink on a summers day.<br /><br />I enjoyed this experience and recommend Starbucks Blonde Veranda Blend for those who like light roast coffee, and maybe, for those who love dark roast, as an occasional treat. TL;DR Soft as a Spring Day"
"I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have ""surprise jelly beans"" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated. TL;DR More beans than I know what to do with."
"This kcup was pretty tasty once you get past the weird smell while brewing.  It was described as a bit ""funky"" by some coworkers.  I tried it out anyway and was impressed.  It's very smooth and has a nice pumpkin flavor.  It gets better as it cools.  The clove flavor is only slighty noticeable which is a very good thing.  The flavor was pretty close to pumpkin pie.  This would mix really well with a good french vanilla kcup and some cinnamon.  The flavor is light years better than the Green Mountain pumpkin spice kcup. It took me a year to get through that box.  I threw out the last few. TL;DR Best of the pumpkin kcups"
"Received the shipment promptly but to my dismay, it did not contain the mini treats I had ordered, but ""small"", which were not that small.  I have very small dogs and I really wanted the minis. I contacted the seller (Petco) and after several days, they responded that I could return them but if I reordered minis, they would still send the small because Amazon had the item numbers wrong and they don't have minis. They said the simplest thing would be to return them for credit. This did not seem economically feasible, so I am breaking each one into small pieces which is very inconvenient. TL;DR My dogs love the taste!"
"I first was introduced to this candy, when it showed up at Marshall's store.<br />However only found it once.  Called the company which told me they only<br />sold to stores.  suggest that I go on line, so I did.  This candy<br />is great.  Compared it against jar honey, the organic honey seems better.<br />It has the pure honey tast, it is light and good.<br />I would highly recomand it. TL;DR Organic Honey candy"
After recently moving to a GF diet we were looking for a simple sweet treat. This even works well in a bread machine. TL;DR Good Sweet Treat
"Our Chinese Cresteds do agility and even though they are very food oriented, it's important to have a variety of special treats to keep them motivated.  For our breed, these are perfect because they are small and soft and the dogs think they're fabulous!  The 4 pack is a good price, too. TL;DR Yummy training treats!"
Dr. Oz had recommended chia seeds to be added to an adult daily diet.  I found exactly what I needed at Amazon with these chia seeds!  Love the minimal packaging! TL;DR Exactly what I wanted
"I recently purchased the 20-pack of 2.6 oz. bags of Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists. They are excellent and my family agrees! The 2.6 oz. bag makes it easy to control portions for those who (like me) are on a restricted diet. Unfortunately, when I tried to re-order within the last week, they are not available or no longer stocked. Upon searching for other suppliers, I found a few who have these available. However, they are available at a higher price than on Amazon. I already consider these great tasting pretzels to be a splurge item - if you do the math you find they are a little pricey for a snack item, even at Amazon's price. I truly hope these Glutino gluten-free pretzels will soon become available. I had planned to buy them again and again. They are a good-tasting, crisp and crunchy, very satisfying snack food. TL;DR Where have all the pretzels gone?"
"These Luxardo Maraschino cherries are nothing like those radioactive red cherries packed in sugar water. These are real live Maraschino (a variety like Bing) cherries packed in very thick syrup. They have really great wild cherry flavor and are much smaller.<br /><br />The one complaint I have with these cherries is the incredibly thick syrup. For cocktails the syrup is too thick for my taste.<br /><br />The cherries are small, about half the size of the Maraschino cherries found in most stores. There is real intense cherry flavor in these little nuggets. The cherries are all stemless, so they require a pick of some kind for drinks. On the other hand, on top of ice cream, the lack of stem is a great thing. Sadly watching your friend tie the stem up in a knot with their tongue, will just have to be done with other cherries.<br /><br />There is no alcohol in these cherries. The 360 gram jar contains about the same weight of cherries as a standard sixteen ounce jar of radioactive cherries.<br /><br />For cocktails, I prefer cherries preserved in brandy, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G5WI68"">Morello Cherries in Liqueur and Kirsch Unique recipe Griottines from France 11.8 oz</a>.<br /><br />Luxardo makes some amazing products, their cherry liquor and lemoncello is fabulous. Their canned cherries are wonderful, certainly a step a long ways up from those radioactive cherries. TL;DR Great Flavor"
"I do love PopChips. They work well with weight watchers, taste great and the crunch can't be beat. This pack has many flavors, with the salt and vinegar being my favorite, my husband loves the salt and pepper and my kids like original and cheddar.<br /><br />The one I miss is Sweet Potato. It is by far my favorite of the whole lot of flavors, but aren't included in this variety pack. TL;DR Love these, good variety pack"
"Being a green tea drinker, typically, I enjoy the stronger flavor of Higgins and Burke English Breakfast Tea.  I have only ever tried one other brand of English breakfast tea, so bear this in mind.<br /><br />I enjoyed the flavor immensely.  It is not as strong as I thought it would be, but I still enjoy the flavor.  Maybe it's because I do not drink coffee and my drink of choice is green tea, but I found it a good way to start the day, as well as a nice, relaxing drink for after dinner.<br /><br />If you are looking for a bolder taste, you should search elsewhere for something stronger.  If you are like me, though, you will enjoy the smooth and flavorful taste of Higgins and Burke: recommended. TL;DR A flavorful tea, even if it is mild"
"This is one of the most enjoyable products ever tasted with wasabi. In other words, I am in love with hot seasoned foods. TL;DR Annie Chun's Roasted Wasabi Seaweed Snacks"
Glad to know there are lovers of this coffee out there because that means not everyone is on board with the Starbucks 'burnt' bean flavor I so deplore. This Eight O'clock coffee is for those of us who truly love the taste of coffee--just a simple cup--either black or with a little cream. This coffee is perfectly roasted to allow the true flavor of the bean to come through. Now it probably wouldn't stand up to the heavy creams and caramel and what ever else Starbucks sells in their coffee. At any rate I'm not buying it. Give me true coffee flavor any day. This and Melitta are my favorite coffees. TL;DR The Starbucks Antithesis!
"As a tea aficionado, I generally shop for tea by brand. I have had many, many brands of peppermint tea: this is the BEST hands-down. Pure, brisk unapologetically peppermint - not watered down with other mints or additional herbal ingredients as most other brands do. [By this same token:  beware if you don't necessarily want something this potently peppermint-y!] I love this tea - it's good for tummy upset, too. TL;DR If you like Peppermint tea, you will LOVE this brand!"
"I passed these out on the birth of may granddaughters to the firefighters I work with and church members.  They loved them.  The bubble gum was good, but the smiles on peoples faces was even better.  Great way to celebrate TL;DR It's a Girl Ceegars"
"The cookie is amazing, very soft. My daughters ages 4 years old and 10 months couldn't resist them. I had to buy another box right away. TL;DR Delicious"
"I try to stick to all natural products in my household.  That goes double for my dog.  she is a super mutt with a strong stomach, but that doesn't mean I want to take any chances.  these seem like quality treats and she really enjoys them. I have purchased several flavors and she loves them all.  will definitely buy them again. TL;DR GREAT TREATS"
I read Harlan Coben books and in some of them he has a continuing character who drinks YooHoo's.  I had never heard of them and never saw them in a store.  They sounded like something my husband would like so when I saw them on Amazon.com I ordered some.  He LOVES them.  I'm definitely going to be ordering more. TL;DR WOO HOO for YOO HOO's!
"good taste, possibly  elevates mood- this one is non-carbonated , better than the other Neuro carbonated drinks that upset my stomach. TL;DR Very good!"
"Shipment arrived much faster than promised, was packed securely, excellent product. TL;DR SUNKIST GOURMET FRUIT GEMS 144 COUNT"
Always consistently good.  High quality salt.  My primary choice for over ten years.  Have compared to others and it always wins...hands-down. TL;DR Great product

"I purchased the chest for someone as a gift, so I didn't get to see it, but from what I hear, it was perfect. It had everything and it was true to the description. TL;DR It had everything"
"I went from the bison formula to this fish one for my 4 month old German Shepherd.  We started at a ratio of new to old being 1:4 for the first 2 days, and then half for a day, and then full out. I thought this transition should be fine since its from the same manufacturer, but boy was I wrong! This was way too fast of a transition and our dog had the runs for many days afterwards. 1.5 weeks later it stiffened up well enough for about 1-2 weeks. However, at the moment she is having the runs again, although I don't think it has anything to do with the food anymore. Out vet claims it is growing pains.<br /><br />Anyway, my biggest problem with this food is its strong fishy smell. Its like you had raw fish sitting out in room temp for a day or so.  Just because this smell factor, I am not going to get this formula again.<br /><br />I'd like to note, I sampled another brand with fish formula, and it had the same problem. So I would assume all the fish formulas do this regardless of brand.<br /><br />I plan to try the venison next. TL;DR Fine product, but way too fishy smelling!"
"We use this Worthington Vegetarian Burger for so many different meals. We make tacos, meatloaf, meatballs, sloppy joe and many other things that call for ground beef. The price on Amazon is an AWESOME deal for 12 cans. I hope they will continue to stock this item because from now on we'll be buying it online instead of the health food store. We also enjoy the Worthington Chili very much and will be purchasing it from Amazon next time. These products are an excellent substitute for meat. Can't say enough about them! TL;DR Excellent Product!"
"Since I am diabetic, I have tried every artificial sweetener on the market. For me, all of them have too much of a bitter aftertaste to be usable. I had read that xylitol is more or less a 'natural' product, and after having heard a professional chef give glowing reports of Ideal (xylitol) on a radio program, I ordered the three bulk forms of the product.<br />It tastes fine in beverages. Of all the sweeteners I've tried it IS actually the closest to the taste of sugar, with the least noticeable aftertaste. It does measure like sugar, too, as advertised on the package.<br />However, baked goods made with the granular, confectioners' and brown sugar mixtures of Ideal product were unsatisfactory. Cookies made measure for measure with Ideal were mealy and did not brown. There's no way to get a crisp cookie or moist cake because the xylitol does not carmelize, so the only texture it contributes is dry grainy-ness. I suppose the radio chef raved about the product because he was trying to sell his cookbook dealing with the use of xylitol as a sugar substitute.<br />I will continue using Ideal in my coffee, but not for baking. I'm very disappointed that Ideal does not perform at all well in baked goods. TL;DR Not what I was hoping for"
I use this particular type of agave nectar as it is recommended in my almond flour cookbook.  This size works perfectly for me.  It's not too heavy to pour a simple 1/2 cup of product and the price is way better from Amazon than from my local health food store.  This is a win-win!!  Thanks Amazon for another amazing deal. TL;DR Great Product - Great Price
"I was very pleased with the quantitly, the quality and that I received it promptly. TL;DR great value and received timely"
Oil is clear but not teases like French truffle I had before. I am not order anymore. TL;DR truffle tease not much
"These are delicious! I've tried both the milk chocolate and dark and wouldn't turn down either one, but these are my favorite between the two.  You get a small pouch with little turtle-like candies that have a delicious gooey carmel center.  Perfectly done, well portioned and 120 calories per pack.  Is it a health food?  No, but if it is a choice between diving into a pint of ice cream or having a candy bar, this will fill you up for far fewer calories and will satisfy your sweet tooth.  My dad, who can be a bit particular tried these on my recommendation and mom now has it on the weekly shopping list.  Definitely a hit if you are looking for a small treat while you are watching that waistline! TL;DR when you want a portion controlled sweet...."
I make raspberry truffles with this white chocolate then coat it in bittersweet chocolate.  It makes a special gift!  I love this stuff and it is easy to melt in the little callies. TL;DR Great for holiday truffles!
Arrived on time and tastes great. Gevalia coffees are very good..better<br />than what you can buy in the supermarket.I recommend it. TL;DR gevalia is the best
"DISGUSTING, RANCID AND UNRETURNABLE ""FOOD"" PRODUCT.<br />DO NOT BUY...HORRIBLE. GROSS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME.  MADE IN TIAWAN, i THREW MY WHOLE ORDER IN THE TRASH. TL;DR RANCID"
"Tried a few sustainable tunas, and we like this the best. If you add a little olive oil, the flavor gets better.<br /><br />Skipjack is a species of tuna that grows quickly -- so you are not hurting the ecosystem (as much), and also younger fish = less mercury.<br /><br />There are some high-end, Mediterranean tunas that taste a bit better -- but I give this 5 stars for sustainability. TL;DR Tasty sustainable tuna"
"One of the nicest, smoothest cup of chai I've made. Nice mix of spices, largest overtone is the cardamom, but since i do like a half/half of tea with milk or soy milk as my chai drink, this is a good base for me. TL;DR Chai for the morning"
I've tried a number of brands of these peppers. These are the best so far! They came quickly and all undamaged via UPS Recommended to try! TL;DR Delicious!
"I have 2 cats who love this food.  One has long silky hair and the other very thick short hair.  Since they have been eating it, I have seen far less shedding, fewer hairballs and brighter coats. Good stuff! TL;DR good stuff"
This is a good deal on a super scone mix. The directions are simple and easy to follow. The scones produced are great and bound to be a hit with everyone-perfect item for a tea party or just because you feel like whipping up a batch of scones on the spur of the moment! Get the Nordic scone pan to really ensure perfection. You will need to add additional liquid when using it and there are directions for that on the mix bag.Enjoy! TL;DR Easy and Delicious
"These nutty bars are huge compared to the average granola bar.  They actually taste pretty good too. They are definitely not a healthy type bar, more like a candy alternative.  The thing is covered with a peanut butter like coating on the bottom of the length of the bar which tastes great.  There are only 5 bars in the box, so I guess the large size is supposed to offset that.  I am a little on the fence, as they do taste good, but they aren't something I would normally crave for.  I do think they should be eaten with a drink nearby as they are a little on the dry side. TL;DR These nut bars are making me thirsty!"
"First off, I love all the Coffee People coffee..at least all the ones they make in K-Cups, but I like a stronger, bolder coffee.  While Jet Fuel and Wake-Up Call are my favorites of the bolder coffees I have chosen to stay with the Black Tiger as my main stay KCup of choice, I cant really say what in the flavor make it my favorite, just that it is.  And  I LOVE the frustration free packaging and the auto ordering. TL;DR Better than Jet Fuel"
"If I had to choose a last meal, Kraft spaghetti would be it.  Prepared with lean hamburger, it is the food of the gods!  I'm sure some will think I'm joking, but I'm not.  Why you can't find this in grocery stores is beyond me. TL;DR Let's say I was on death row..."
"My dogs LOVE these treats!  I try to always look for free shipping - didn't get that this time, but will be sure to watch for that next time. TL;DR Greenies"
"I am so impressed with this product! Loma Linda Swiss Stakes are a flavorful high-protein meat substitute with delicious savory gravy and they're even great right out of the can, which makes it a wonderful option if you travel or go camping. I just ordered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AYFAMO"">Loma Linda Fried Chik'N with Gravy, 13-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a> based on all the 4- and 5-star reviews and hope I love it as much as the Swiss Stakes. I'm so happy these products are available on Amazon! TL;DR Meat substitute with wonderful texture and flavor."
"I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...<br /><br />The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it. TL;DR Moldy meat."
"These are the only treats my wife's cats eats.  Give them anything else the dogs end up eating them.  Its funny because they like them so much they have learned to beg for them.  You can't lose with these treats, your cat will love them. TL;DR The only treats my wifes cats eat"
"We love the taste of Illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine-- smooth, never bitter. You cannot distinguish the flavor of the decaf from the flavor of the regular espresso.<br /><br />AIlly's vacuum-packed canister has a unique, design and is reusable. TL;DR Illy Decaf Espresso is Mighty Fine"
"So I got a box of these for my 3 year old Norwegian Elkhound. All dog owners know that there are many, many products out there that claim to clean your dog's teeth. So do it better than others, and some my dog flat out won't eat.<br /><br />When I first opened the box of these I was amazed at the size of them. The box does say large, but these things are huge. I would recommend this size for much larger breed dogs than my 50 pound elkhound.<br /><br />The benefit of them being so big is it does take her a little bit of time to chew the whole thing up and eat it.<br /><br />Results? Not really sure. The box says to feed at least two of these to your dog per day. But quite honestly, that would get really expensive and I am not sure what the dietary 'after effects' would be with that dose and I really  don't want to find out. So I can not really speak to the cleanabability that this product does.<br /><br />I can say my dog enjoys them and does take a little time eating them. TL;DR Dog approved"
"This is currently my favorite coffee...potent, but smooth. The autoship option is so convenient....now I never run out of k-cups, and the price is better than at any of my local stores. TL;DR Great coffee"
"I don't cook a WHOLE lot with coconut milk, but for what I use it for, it works excellent. Tastes good also. The cans did arrive all dented up, but it didn't affect the taste. Buying it at the grocery store is cheaper where I live though. TL;DR Great Coconut Milk"
"I previously ordered my coconut oil in bulk from another company. Fortunately when it came time to order, they were out of stock.... which prompted me to seek another brand.<br /><br />This Nutiva coconut oil is so smooth, like butter. I will definitely order this again. We use our oil for cooking, baking, chocolate delight (for the hcg diet) and I have used it for many years as a moisturizer. This week marks the 1st time I will begin using this for oil pulling. TL;DR Love this VCO!"
"I got hooked on matcha but found the habit price prohibitive.  I was paying $8 for 1 oz. Then I found this matcha on Amazon and I made my first cup last night and I hated it.  Then I made my second cup this morning a discover the secret of perfect matcha.  The secret is don't use too much of the emerald green powder or you will have one heck of a bitter cup of tea, which is what I did with my first cup.  A dainty scoop (about 1/8 of a tsp) is all you need for a delicious cup and if it tastes bitter use less.  This is medicine, this is pure pleasure and relaxation and a little goes a long way making this a great deal.  I figured if 2 containers weighing 10.58 oz each would have cost me about $160 if I paid the $8 per 1 oz that I was paying when I got hooked on matcha.  So this deal saves me about $120...now I wonder how long will this purchase of matcha last since I feel free to drink as much as I want and am no longer limited to one cup in the morning and one cup in the evening.<br /><br />A good read that explains the philosophy of tea (Teaism) is The Book of Tea, free for kindle and written over 100 years ago.  It explains the 3 historical periods of tea, which matcha being the second period.  The 3 periods of tea refers to the way the tea was prepared.  The first period is caked tea, then whipped tea (matcha), then steeped tea.  Matcha is an ancient way of preparing tea.<br /><br />Consider purchasing the bamboo whisk to whip your matcha because if you don't whip it you will get little clumps.  I drink my matcha from a small bowl purchased at the local Asian store which allows for the whipping of my matcha and is the traditional way. TL;DR Oh so good!"
"I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast. TL;DR The best I've had"
"I love the litter dropper in the lid to add just the right number of drops. It is spicy, but not too bad. For some fun try adding 4-5 drops in your next batch of brownies. It's actually really good. TL;DR Excellent for Spicing up Dishes"
"I tried this product for a very simple reason: I drink tea all day long and sometimes I just want hot water, but don't necessarily want another cup of tea. I thought his would be a convenient thing to have in my office: boil a cup of water and toss in a few drops for flavor. And it is actually pretty good for that. I found that the flavor was good, but I have probably been putting too much in (one long squeeze, rather than drops) and it's a bit too sweet (it almost tastes like Cool Aid if you put too much in). But still, for a quick flavoring, it's not that bad. If you have a water cooler with a hot-water tap at work, this would probably be nice to keep in your desk. I would imagine in summer if you (like me) carry a water bottle everywhere, this would be good, too.<br /><br />I just happened to see a big display for Mio in the local grocery store, so apparently they are ramping up their marketing. If it gets successful, I'd say it falls into that ""Why didn't I think of that?"" category of inventions. TL;DR Kind of Sweet, but Convenient Too"
"I was excited to find Kale chips. I make them at home in my oven.<br />I thought these would be the same. I thought I was paying for a box of several, insted I got 1 container and paid 5 $  for shipping. My fault for not reading. In total I paid 14 $ for this snack.<br /><br />They looked kind of funkey, but what health food dosent? They were covered in this powdered chese like the kind got get in a Kraft Mac N' Chese box. All I could tase was the chese.<br /><br />I am going to stick to making them in my oven.<br />Strip Kale from the stem, place leaves in mixing bowl, add some salt, cayan pepper, and olive oil.<br />Place in oven @ 350, back for 20-25 min<br />Turn a few times and cook until crisp, but not too crisp. TL;DR YUCK!"
"I buy mine for about $1. This is a very easy, quick lunch. It's a little salty for me but I still like it. TL;DR Very easy lunch"
"I bought this for my husband on valentines day. he absolutely loved it! Took him a month to finish the whole thing. Great gift for a loved one, or a gag gift at christmas. I recomend to everyone. TL;DR Excellent gift."
I found a 30 oz container of this at a local retailer and loved it.  I went back to get a few more to put in the freezer but unfortunately I waited too long.  When I finally went back to the store they only had the Coconut Curry in stock.  I guess everyone else loved the Butter Masala as well.  I can also say that my other favorite is the Maya Kaimal Classic Korma sauce...yum. TL;DR Restaurant Quality
"Remember that old Double Mint gum ad- double your pleasure, double your fun?<br />That is exactly what you get with Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds. The richness of the almonds, and the smooth taste of chocolate powder. Who'da thought to put these two together? A genius. One you start eating it is difficult to maintain control, but I did it.  I took the recommended amount for one serving and used this as my treat for the evening.<br /><br />These cocoa powdered almonds  will be a part of my diet from hence forth.<br />Highly recommended. prisrob 06-12-08 TL;DR Double Your Pleasure"
"I love Linketts, they have been a favorite since I was a kid. If you weren't raised eating them you might not like them but if you like trying new things and like other vegetarian foods you should try these. I use them just as meat eaters use regular hot dogs. They taste great fried with Worthington chili. You can also be creative with these and come up with some great recipes. One of my favorites uses brown rice, olive oil, onion powder, stewed tomatoes, canned black beans, and sliced Linketts and then putting it in tortillas. It is one of the greatest recipes ever just don't leave out any of the ingredients I once forgot to add the black beans and it wasn't even close to as amazing.<br /><br />Also since the Linketts are not meat based it not a problem to eat them straight from the can but DO NOT judge the taste based on that alone because they taste completely different when they are fried or grilled. Also I think most people would only like them fried or grilled especially people who are or were meat eaters. TL;DR My favorite since childhood"
"A nutritionist recommended truffle oil to me as a healthy alternative to butter. I don't use a lot of butter to begin with but am always looking for ways to improve my diet and I do like popcorn with butter, it's kind of my ""downfall"" Well, the nutritionist recommended truffle oil I then e-mailed her and asked her ""which one"" white or dark truffle? She said both are good, the white is milder. I have only used this on a couple of items so far. I've used it on steamed pot stickers and on some bow tie pasta. I must say, it is the most delicious condiment...I never would have dreamed that a flavored olive oil could be so magnificent! And fortunately, a little bit goes a long way because it is, as you can see, rather expensive. I haven't tried it on popcorn yet. Instead I bought some of the 100 calorie Jiffy Pop Microwave Kettle Corn (also available from Amazon and also recommended by my nutritionist). It too is great and needs not butter or anything added.<br /><br />You really should try truffle oil. I don't know how this particular brand measures up to the other brands but I can tell you this Plantin White Truffle infused oil is delicious. I believe you can buy this product with confidence. I am going to order some more but I'm going to order the dark truffle instead just so I'll experience the difference.<br /><br />One final note: I was warned that once opened it can go rancid rather quickly. Accordingly, I've been storing mine in the refrigerator and when I want to use it I just take the cap off and microwave it for about 20 seconds. Voila! This is truly a gourmet and HEALTHY item. Enjoy! TL;DR Fantastic! Wow!"
"Canned coffee-drinks, in my experience, can often miss the mark, but I'm happy to report that this Illy product tastes very good. In fact, it tastes almost exactly like a fresh iced-coffee with milk, with a hint of chocolate. It's sweet but not overwhelming. Of course, it's missing that classic coffee ""bitterness,"" (which, I suppose, a lot of people dislike anyway), but it's still definitely a beverage I'd be happy to drink two, or even three, at a time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these coffee-drinks are often a bit pricey, and Illy is no exception. Even buying a 12 pack here on Amazon, you're spending (as of this review) 23 cents per ounce, which is a lot for a beverage. In comparison, brewing an iced-coffee at home would cost a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />However, if you're willing to pay for it, then you can't go wrong here. As I said, the taste is delicious, and the caffeine content (81mg per can) and nutritional content (100 cal, 1.5g fat) is comparable to coffee w/ milk. TL;DR Great taste, a bit pricey"
This spice is wonderful.  I put it in/on almost everything.  I especially like it in my omelets and on pan fried potatoes. TL;DR Mexican Spice
I've relied in this the whole time I wad breastfeeding my baby for 7 months. I was able to pump 4 times a day with 5-6oz per pumping because of fenugreek. I took a total of 12 capsules a day. The Health store lady says it was ok to do so and was fine the whole time I took it. TL;DR Milk!
"This adds a delicious, sweet shot of Hazelnut flavour to your coffee. Black coffee aficionados may not go for these syrups as, well, since this is a flavoured sugar syrup, it's going to sweeten your coffee. But, if you like your coffee a little sweet, with a nice, subtle, nutty Hazelnut flavour to it, this syrup will be right up your alley.<br /><br />I also think that these syrups (I have a bottle of their English Toffee flavour, regular sugar-sweetened, as well), are a nice alternative to the flavoured coffees out there. If you just don't feel like having a slew of different types of coffee in the house, and have a favorite unflavoured coffee that you prefer to use, these syrups are a great way to add a little variety to your cuppa Joe without jam-packing your pantry (or freezer) with too much of a good thing.<br /><br />Since I like my coffee to be very sweet and creamy, I DO add sugar to my coffee in addition to these Da Vinci flavoured syrups, as well as plenty of creamer. I'm confident that a half capful of this syrup by itself will be enough to sweeten your coffee more than adequately, if you just want a shot of the delicious taste of Hazelnut to enhance your coffee-drinking experience. Delicious, and FAR easier than making your own Hazelnut-flavoured simple syrup at home! ;)  Enjoy! TL;DR Imparts a delicious, sweet shot of Hazelnut flavour!"
"This is in reference to the Unsweetened tea. The label on front proclaims in giant print that it is brewed with all natural ingredients.<br /><br />Only on the back in fine print under ingredients do you learn that it has ""CARAMEL COLOR ADDED [ed. emphasis] for uniformity of color"". I would contend they did it to make it look darker and stronger than their competitors.<br /><br />I grew up in the south and my mom made iced tea twice per day and she never felt compelled to add any caramel color and we never complained it wasn't dark enough. She let the tea provide its own color, just as nature made it.<br /><br />Tradewinds should stop trying to dupe their customers with misleading labels. The tea was only so-so anyway. I certainly won't buy it again...and besides the price I paid was about half of Amazon's price and since I bought locally, there was no shipping either. This one is a loser. TL;DR Misleading label"
Finally I've found a cookie that I love and feel good after I eat them as well!  They are satisfying and have a nice subtleness to them.  Feel the love! TL;DR Yum
"Not worth the money. The product did not have as much as picture shown. Way too much money for what you think you are getting. Sent for a present, very embarrassed when parent called and said I hope you did not pay too much for this. TL;DR Candhy Crate Kooky Kid Crazy Candy GIft Box"
"These oatmeal squares are delicious! They are chewy and you can taste the chocolate chips on every bite. I first got hooked on these due to Costco. Unfortunately, the Costco around the house stop selling these. Lucky for me, I found the squares on Amazon. I bought a box of these in November of 2010 and the best by date on the squares is June 2011. It looks like it has a shelf life of 6 to 7 months.<br /><br />These squares are 190 Calories, fat is 50 calories (6 grams), sodium 110 mg, total carb 28 grams, sugar 13 grams, and protein is 6 grams.<br /><br />(Update 10/2/2011)<br />Well, it appears Corazonas changed how they made the oatmeal squares. The squares are on my 'Subscribe and Save' list from Amazon and the last two monthly shipments I noticed some changes. It is now less sweet, less chewy, more thicker/airy, and more dry then before. I still think the squares are good and will continue to have them on my 'Subscribe and Save' list, but I do prefer the old recipe.<br /><br />(Update 12/6/2011) Back to the old recipe!!! Hopefully, I just had a bad batch. TL;DR Delicious!"
"The Newton brand has extended its profile into these ""Fruit Thins"". The package is well designed and easy to open and looks nice. There are two rows of cookies (as I call them, I don't know what a ""thin"" is), each about 2-inches in diameter.. It looks like about 50 cookies in a package. Biting into it, it has a firmness, but not over-cooked where it crumbles, but not too soft where it melts. Its somewhere in the middle. The cranberries here are the winners. They are what keeps this cookie together! They have a vibrant taste to them and contrast the oats very well with a hint of citrus behind it. There are a few other flavors, but one I am sampling is the Cranberry Citrus Oats. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wonder if this something I would seek out myself to buy. I enjoyed them very much and will have no problem finishing off the package, but whether or not I will return to buy them again is debatable. I have not had a fig newton in such a long time that I dont foresee this replacing any memories of the fig, or even any inclination towards a cookie in the near future (maybe that is not something that should be considered as part of my review, but I am). But if you are a cookie person who likes that snack to have in the house, I would definitely recommend this as something new to try out. You will probably enjoy it as much as I did. TL;DR A Fig Newton Cookie?"
"sent a case of this product to my brother,he stated numerous cans had tops dented and crushed. thank you ups. i ordered a case in glass bottles a short time ago all were intact.sure am glad i didnt have same driver it would have benn a real mess TL;DR damaged cans"
"Very crispy and decent taste, but bottom-line is very healthy one. I would strongly recommend for anyone who cares for a healthy snack alternative! TL;DR Healthy snack"
I will reorder.Nice little addition to go along with my unwinding routine. Feels nice and not overpowering.  Life is too stressful without a way to cope so why not try this? TL;DR Nice little enhancer
My puppy loved it but every time I get it to him he got real bad diarrhea... I took him off of it and the diarrhea stopped and every time I tried to give him more of it the diarrhea came back. TL;DR Diarrhea
If you like potato chips and the like - like I do - then these crisps are the perfect alternative! They have all the texture and flavor some of the best known brands have - without the added sodium/carbs/calories! In my opinion they are the PERFECT SNACK! TL;DR Great snack for anyone who eats right!
"I don't know if my local pet store carries this brand, but I am impressed with the fact that it is grain free and my cat seems to like it.  In fact, he may be satisfied with a tiny bit less food because of its content.  That remains to be seen.<br /><br />You can't beat the convenience of finding the pet food you like on Amazon and having it delivered right to your door. TL;DR Quality, Convenience"
One word--hooked!<br />And I was really shocked that it wasn't so heavy in calories and sugar but still creamy tasting-<br />Good addition to my morning shake or when i can't resist that damn reese cup. TL;DR addicting!
"Coffee and coconut water in the same place...doesn't get much better! I have since found this product in stores close to me, so I will purchase them in store instead of online. TL;DR Refreshing Coco Cafe"
"This is good honey flows easy has a slight cinnamon flavor clear and so far has not crystallized at all, I'm almost done with bottle two. I enjoy a teaspoon full in my tea. TL;DR Good Honey"
I started buying these when they first came out and was thrilled to have a gluten free version of rice krispies at the same price as regular. Then the local stores stopped carrying them for whatever reason and I was very disappointed. It's great to find them on here and at the subscribe and save price they're more affordable than the tiny boxes of organic speciality rice krispies imitators that are still available in the local store. I don't need organic or whatever I just need it sans gluten. These fit the bill just fine and make terrific peanut butter rice krispies treats. TL;DR Hard to find at local stores
We used to buy this at DFW airport on our way back from Mexico.  We had not been that way in a long time and my wife asked for it for Xmas.  I was very glad to find it on line. TL;DR If you haven't tried it ...
"Having been an ex-Hendricks man (now drink Plymouth exclusively - no back sass) - this is a great alternative to regular or diet tonic.  Don't expect the taste to floor you, in fact, some of the ""posts"" comment that it's flat & boring.  It's much more subtle.  O.K. - - if your taste buds must be loaded with sugar or you do not care for a clean gin and are heavy on the ""Botanicals,"" then this might not be the tonic for you.<br /><br />But if you are tired of the sugar in regular tonic water or the crap in diet tonic water, than this is a nice choice.  With a little bit of lime and a little heavier on the gin, this makes for a heavenly drink where you can savor the gin & tonic mixture.  Cuts out a lot of calories, too!<br /><br />One word of caution - - it can lose it's carbonation, quick.  Best to buy the small bottles (I've purchased both) and put a bottle type pressure sealer on the top if you want to save the little residue of the small bottle (if you're only having one drink.) TL;DR Great Alternative"
We have a cat with a sensitive stomach. When we made the emergency adoption she was undernourished and her coat was in really bad shape. We tried quite a few foods but found that bonito type food was something she enjoyed and it really aided in bringing her back to health.<br /><br />The reason I like this product is that the flakes are a nice size and there does not seem to be all the powdered up flakes like in other products. TL;DR Very Good
"I was excited to try this product.  I am reasonable fan of almonds.  (especially fond of smoked almonds) and I like chocolate.<br />However the combination of the dry cocoa powder, which is slightly bitter, and the dry unsalted taste of the almond doesn't really seem to work.<br />Frankly first impression is one of blandness.<br />Maybe because my palette leans toward the sweet side, these just seem bland.  The combination almost offsets the benefits of either taste.  It's just not a sweet taste, and that was what I expected. TL;DR Two tastes that don't mix well"
Im a big licorice fan - especially soft and chewy. This Haribo is a great price so i tried it. It was very fresh and chewy but really has no flavor outside of a slightly chemical taste. TL;DR Great texture but no flavor
"This cream is delicious.  My children love it on toast, but I think it tastes best on mince pies.  The cream arrived fresh and well-packaged.  The product ships fast and the seller is highly recommended.  Will order again from this seller. TL;DR Fresh and Delicious"
"I'm getting noticeably better results than I used to get with the normal supermarket brands, plus, it's cheaper. What's not to like? TL;DR superior"
"The machine that I have came with these capsules, and I have gotten more.  It is really good coffee, and makes a good crema on top.  Much better than any Starbucks/coffee house; a lot of the help there do not know how to make good coffee/foamed milk.  Very satisfied. TL;DR Good Coffee"
"I have never found Altoids to be lacking.  Also bought the new licorice flavor.  It is really nice if you like licorice, and I do.<br /><br />Good price. TL;DR Cuious. . . and strong."
"I have a several chipmunk holes around my house which go under concrete and am concerned they are going to damage the foundation.  So I bought the spray AND granules neither worked a snot.  I then took the remaining product and COMPLETELY filled the holes with Critter Ridder.  Within hours the chipmunks just pushed it aside and continued using the exact same hole.  Do NOT buy this for chipmunks it is 100% ineffective.  It would be worth the price if it worked, but it was absolutely useless for every chipmunk hole I used it on.  Save your money buy a trap.  I doubt they even tested this on chipmunks.  It may work for squirrels but they are wrong about Chip and Dale. TL;DR Completely Useless for Chipmonks"
"This bottle of heaven got to my door quickly as expected. It has the perfect blend of heat and flavor. It kinda has the Asian style taste to it as well as a Mexican side which makes it darn near perfect. It was so good, I poured some in a bowl and used it as salsa. I put this stuff on everything now! TL;DR Simply Amazing!"
"I love these. That is the easiest way to put it. I purchased these because they have always looked so delicious. The only complaint I might have, is that these couldn't last. Everyone in the house ate them right out from under me.<br /><br />I would purchase more, but the one thing that has stopped me from doing so is that the shipping price is quite simply put, outrageous. Maybe the next time I have a bunch of extra cash I'll pick up another batch, and hide them very well. TL;DR Amazing taste"
"My 4 year old cat's first experience with these went as follows.  I put two greenies on the windowsill where he was busy munching oat grass (a constant in my house); he sniffed the greenies; gobbled them crunch, crunch, crunch, gone; then looked for more for the next 15 minutes.  I think that counts as a success.  He likes them even better than he does catnip, which he really likes.  Will they keep his teeth cleaner?  I don't know because his teeth are in pretty good condition either because of his young age, the oat grass or the cat chewy toys I give him.  But he goes to the vet every year for a check up and I will keep track and report back. TL;DR Love at First Bite"
This salt was an impulse purchase that has become a favorite. It has a great flavor and texture that adds a new dimension to my food. TL;DR Great flavor and texture
"This winter cocoa pocky is amazing and so much better than regular chocolate pocky, which is also great in its own way.  The chocolate tastes similar to that of regular chocolate pocky, but is much thicker and creamier and all around about 10x more amazing.  It's kind of like a perfect blend of milk and dark chocolate and has a tiny bit of powdered cocoa on the outside.  In the box, there's 4 individual packets with 6 sticks of pocky each, 24 total, so it's perfect for sharing or, you know, not.  The only thing you'll hate about this product is when it's gone and then you have to go get some more.  This pocky is a must try for pocky lovers or even people who've never heard of pocky before.  Try it, you won't be disappointed! TL;DR So much better than regular chocolate pocky!"
"The Halvah is very good, and the merchant shipped the product in a timely manner. In fact, I'm about to open my last can, so I will be ordering more shortly.<br /><br />For those with health concerns - This confection is not excessively sweet, and it's a pretty decent source of protein. The only caveat is that folks who may have nut allergies. Halvah is made from nuts! So... If you have an allergy to sunflower or sesame, stay away. For everyone else - It's an exotic dessert that isn't loaded with cream or sugar. Enjoy. :-) TL;DR Good product from a reliable vendor"
This product is available at 89c at Whole with a 10% case discount and you are charging over $1.30. sometimes when it is on sale we het it at 75c TL;DR Pricey
I love this concentrate.  Just add to water and you have a nutritious drink during the day.  Lucky to have found this product. TL;DR Great Juice Concentrate
"My wife has a male cat who throws up EVERYTHING EXCEPT this food.  The cats prefer this food over the wet food we have tried also.<br /><br />Great Quality, good price. TL;DR Great Food"
"After shopping several places for more economical raw cashews than my local health food market, I decided on this item. They arrived quickly and are great nuts, however, my only complaint would be how they were packaged. Five pounds of cashews should be shipped in a proper box -- NOT a priority mail envelope!! I received my package punctured with a big hole, and there was a hole in the bags inside holding the cashews. Not sure how many cashews I lost in the delivery process, but doesn't look to have been too many. PLEASE Bayside Candy: package them better and I'll be a repeat customer and a 5-star rating!<br /><br />Other than the shipping snafu, the quality of these cashews are very good and are working very nicely in my raw food recipes. TL;DR Excellent Raw Cashews"
"The Planters big nut bars are ok. They aren't too sweet, and actually I would have liked them to be just a little sweeter. They were not as crunchy as I thought they would be for having nuts in them. It could use more nuts than what are in them. I thought they were a bit bland tasting myself, but then again, different people have different tastes. I had my husband and my 10 year old try them. My husband really liked them as he is a HUGE peanut eater. My 10 year old liked them, but said she would only want one once in a great while. I agree with my daughter in the fact I wouldn't want them too often either. So, while they may be good for a quick snack they probably would not be something I would buy very often. They would probably be good to pack for a camping trip for a special treat. TL;DR Ok...not bad...not great...just ok"
I love this product.  My daughter in law served me some one day when I was really down because of my  mother's impending death.  The hot spicy flavor served on the deck of the house was what I needed.  It was absolutely the best chai ever!!!! TL;DR YUM!!!!
"I made this crust into one medium size pizza which gave it a thick crust. When I did it this way, the crust was more like a biscuit than a traditional crust. Both my husband and I were quite happy with the results. TL;DR enjoyable pizza"
"This product is good, at least it does have the after taste like some no sugar products or give you bad digestions afterwards.<br /><br />It is good with my sugar free syrup too!<br /><br />Yummy!! TL;DR no sugar Vanilla Ice Cream"
"I've tried a few different types of minute pearls from Amazon, and these are definitely the best so far! Very close to the kind you would get at a Bubble Tea shop. TL;DR Very good"
"Well, it just came yesterday, 100 tea bags of Windsor, supposed to be the best. I made a pitcher of 20 tea bags by boiling the water, boiling again, letting it sit, putting a tea bag in my mouth and sucking and see if it would numb it. No not noticible at all, no wonder its legal in the US, stupid Coca tea! I heard if you put 3 in your mouth and suck on it for a while it will get numb, but I don't feel like doing that. I'm on my 3rd cup of iced tea today and I think I'm gonna just get a sugar-free monstor or drink expresso. Do I feel stimulated? Slightly. Do I feel sober? Yes. Alert? Yes. Energetic? Not particularly, and the fact its 65 degrees in the house doesn't help, I like warmth. Is it real Coca leaves? Yes, but dried and apparently from my research it would take 100 bags to equal 1 gram of coke. Does that mean 100 bags of fresh? I dont know. Why is it legal? Because there are not enough alkaloids in the tea to be considered an illegal substance, kinda like poppy seeds or the essence of coca you will see in the ingredients of coca-cola. It's also known to calm the cravings of cocaine users, although I don't have cravings any way, but if you do it's recommended.<br /><br />I'm now brewing one cup with 3 bags and seeing if I can tell anything...I pour the boiling water on the 3 bags. It has a nice green grassy color, similiar to green tea. It's quite delicious and as I drink it down my mood is slightly lifted, heart beat increases, but no more than with caffeine. Is it like cocaine? No, not at all and if you buy the tea hoping it's going to be that way, you've got another thing coming and will be very disappointed. I knew all this before I decided to try this. I'm not disappointed, yet not entirely enthusiastic about it either.<br /><br />It's a good alternative for thoughs who don't like coffee, it has a vast amount of vitamins, minerals and health benefits and is certainly better for you than caffeine. Also, surprisingly, no jitters like with coffee. Is it like doing a drug? No, not at all, I feel completely sober, yet my spirits are lifted a bit and a slight tingle, but it could be b/c I'm trying to feel something. I can see why it would be legal in the U.S not to mention it helps the trade commission in a safe legal way. And I'm not just saying that to keep it legal, everything I read about it not being anything like a drug has been true. I just didn't know until I tried it.<br /><br />After drinking the entire pitcher I was very giddy, but that was probably just the mood I was in naturally.<br /><br />Would I buy it again? Probably not, it's rather expensive. I'll just drink my cuban expresso, I like caffeine better than coca tea. TL;DR Windsor Coca Tea Not So Great"
The shipping cost for these Necco Candy wafers is $18.50 almost the same cost as the item.  No thanks!! TL;DR Shipping costs
"I absolutely LOVE this product.  The Black Garlic is creamy, it's sweet and it adds a little something special to food.  I'm still trying to find ways to use it other than just eating it straight out of the container but so far I have added it to my homemade pizza sauce, cream cheese and to my pesto sauce.<br /><br />The cream cheese and black garlic combination was a wonderful savory treat and we ate it with buttery crackers. TL;DR Black Garlic"
"I buy a lot of hot sauces, and this sauce is the hottest of all that I've tasted. It's so hot that my mouth was burning for 15 minutes after I put a couple of drops on a taco. Unfortunately, it has a very strong smoky taste, and just tastes weird in general. I'm sure it's because it's an extract sauce; I also have Blair's After Death Sauce and that has a similarly unpleasant flavor, even though the Original Death Sauce is delicious. TL;DR Extremely hot but tastes unpleasant"
"I have to say, I'm generally not a big fan of organic food. Especially since the taste of organic food can sometimes leave a lot to be desired.  Another drawback is that organic food is, in general, much more expensive than regular. But I have to say, these licorice sticks were a pleasant surprise. They weren't overly sweet and they have a very strong fruit taste. I enjoyed them a lot and would consider buying them in the store. However, I gave a piece to my mom and she said it was ""terrible."" She said it had a really nasty aftertaste. This isn't your run-of-the-mill licorice. However, I think this is one of those foods that either you love them or you hate them. Based on the other reviews I read of this product, there doesn't seem to be much in between. I would definitely be interested in sampling other flavors of this licorice. TL;DR Differing opinions"
"This is quick, easy and above all tasty. I use it as a side and also add cooked meat to make a main dish. TL;DR excellent product"
"After all of the pet food scares a few years ago, I switched to Wellness, which at the time, was a smaller producer of pet food.  I was attracted to the all-natural ingredient list.  But what really mattered was the safety of my cats and this brand had been the subject of any recalls that I was aware of.  Luckily, my cats love it.<br /><br />It is more expensive than grocery store brands or even the premium versions of the name brands, but it is worth it to me.<br /><br />I also think that a diet of Wellness all-natural ingredients has made and ocntinues to make my cats feel, look, and act younger than their ages.  Your mileage may vary, but I gladly pay for Wellness quality. TL;DR My Cats Love Wellness"
I like this tea.  I wish I could find it at the store.  Not a bad price either. TL;DR Good stuff
"My hair dresser's salon bought a Keurig Machine, so I have been able to sample a variety of K-Cups. K-cups are about 10 times more expensive than a regularly brewed cup of coffee so I have never considered buying one for myself, but having a Keurig Machine at a hair salon makes sense! People have a variety of tastes and K-Cups can provide a nice variety and freshly made one at that.<br /><br />The salon has a nice variety of K-cups: Folders, Wolfgang Puck, Timothy's, and Green Mountain (that owns Keurig).<br /><br />Everyone's taste vary, but here is my assessment of the ones that I have tried so far. Wolfgang Puck was my second favorite. So far, I like Folgers the best.<br /><br />FOLGERS GOURMET<br />SELECTIONS LIVELY COLOMBIAN<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 36 for $25)<br />Earthy flavor, fruity and nutty flavors come through.<br /><br />WOLFGANG PUCK CHEFS RESERVE COLOMBIAN DARK ROAST<br />Price per cup: 69 cents (package of 48 for $32.98)<br />A dark roast with caramel and earthy notes, slight burnt<br />and papery flavors.<br /><br />TIMOTHY'S DECAFFEINATED COLOMBIAN MEDIUM<br />Price per cup: 60 cents (package of 50 for $30)<br />A bit on the weak side, kind of papery, and less astringent than the others.<br /><br />Ali Julia review TL;DR Not my favorite, but it came in second"
I have bought these many times for my two hungry golden retrievers.  This is one of their favorite treats.  They have had before the rice balls that are on the ends of these dumbbells and the treat in the middle is an added bonus.  They are crunchy so it helps keep their teeth clean.  Will be back buying these as they go thru these quickly. TL;DR Good Dog Treat
Ok. I ordered these for my son's birthday party candy dishes! I had no idea i was going to have to hide the second bag from husband and father in law just to have them still by the time the party was here! Lol They are mouth watering goodness and highly addicting. The addicting part is the only bad part! They were also super fresh btw...I will definately be ordering them again soon as they were all eaten at the party! Lol thanks! TL;DR Yum!
"This tea really is just an apple cinnamon tea (with no ""spice"" flavor included).  It is pretty mild and tasty enough but I wish it was a bit stronger (if it were I would have given it 5 stars).  Typically I drink green tea or chai tea so this herbal tea is something new to throw into the mix.  Shipping was fast and the boxes were well packed. TL;DR Good flavor, but not my favorite tea"
"Can't stand the other artificial sweetners, ack!  No issues with the seller, prompt and a good deal. Thank you!! TL;DR Thank goodness someone is still selling these!"
I love this bonsai.  I was a bit Leary ordering a live product online but it arrived in perfect shape.  Very full leaves.  Nice pot( worried it would be cheap but it's not at all).  I will probably be ordering a second one soon.  Love it! TL;DR So awesome!
"I recieved a sample of this product from Influenster to try-then immediately went out and bought 2 more boxes, which are now gone also. These cookies have such a great homebaked consistency and just the right amount of spice and sugar. My kids love them too, especially when we cut them in half and put a little ice cream between the halves. TL;DR So Good"
"This Hot Cocoa has no flavor at all.  Even when I used 6 oz of water instead of 8 and made sure all of the product in the K cup was used, it was tasteless. TL;DR No Flavor"
I really did not like this tea. i general love chamomile tea and drink a lot of different brands  but this one has a strong honey flavor that totally overpowers chamomile. TL;DR odd flavor
"Great coffee!  Made even better by the fact that the k-cup is not plastic, making it more eco fiendly!  Scores on all counts!  I have already ordered more. TL;DR San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Fog Chaser, 36-Count"
"I always have trouble sleeping. This helps me relax. I drink 2 before bed time. It's so smooth and comforting, you'll be happy you tried it. TL;DR Perfect"
"For those used to great European mueslis, this product may be a mild disappointment. It has relatively high content of nuts, seeds and fruits (although can't name a percentage), which is good for flavor. It could hold its own in Europe and stay on the market in the middle of the pack, but it doesn't set itself apart.<br /><br />One thing that was a little disturbing esthetically was that the grain flakes (on the oats, I believe, in particular) are marked with crinkly crease lines that made it perfectly clear they had been through some serious industrial machinery, like a stamp of some kind to flatten them out. Maybe this is standard muesli production procedure worldwide, but I've eaten a lot of mueslis and haven't run across such a blatant industrial fingerprint before. It was kind of unsettling and takes away from the illusion that you're eating an ""all-natural"" product. But again, this is only esthetic. If you don't look at your muesli, you won't notice it.<br /><br />If you've had one of the truly great mueslis, like those made by Dorset Cereals of the UK, or even very strong second-tier mueslis by companies like Alnatura of Germany, this muesli will seem run-of-the-mill by comparison. I haven't had a better muesli in the US yet, however. I'm still looking. Until then, Bob's Red Mill is perfectly OK and gets the job done.<br /><br />At the Amazon price of under $28 (March 2009), this is a pretty good bargain too. So that should also count for something. Recommended. TL;DR A good, but not a great muesli"
These cookies in my opinion are way better than fig newtons.And not just because there organic.The taste is truly heavenly if your into fig cookies.For me fig newtons are a thing of the past.And now my present is filled with the gift of fig Newman's. TL;DR great snack
These were supposed to be very good allsorts...they're not.  Some of them are okay but many taste dry & stale.<br />Stew Leonard's are much better and less expensive. TL;DR disappointing
"Looking for great coffee at a great price?  This is it. K-cups are expensive but this coffee is great tasting at a great price when purchased from Amazon TL;DR Great taste, great price"
"I bought these from my local specialty pet store for a dollar more than they're listed on Amazon, and I was glad to pay that price for them. I am excited to find them here at this price, because these were reserved for occasional chewies for my two dogs: an Italian Greyhound and a Pug. My dogs are moderate chewers and these pig ears will last them for at least a week. I give them the pig ears when I leave for school in the morning and even if I am gone for 8 hours or so, they still only make a small dent in it because these are so massive. Then I pick them up and return them to my dogs when I leave the house again. :) And, they do not leave any residue or smell behind, which is awesome because my Italian Greyhound likes to eat his on the couch. I though I was done dealing with pork chews because of the high fat contents of other pig ears and pork chews, but then I came across these and felt the dry, clean texture. At this price, these will become a more regular chew in their chewy repertoire. Merrick makes great products that are made in the USA with all USA sources, which is what I look for when buying my dogs any treats, from biscuits to chews. Even if you have a small dog under 20 lbs, I would recommend trying them, because they  are a great value and dogs can just work on a little bit at a time. I have been able to break them up before (usually a corner will be easier to snap off). TL;DR Not greasy or smelly"
"I bought this product not for consumption purposes, but on the recommendation of several women who - like me - are going through some pretty drastic skin/body/hair changes due to pregnancy.  This is my first pregnancy, and I was completely unprepared for the dry skin, the patches of flakiness and itching, and how it can even make your scalp dry and flaky.  Well, almost everyone knows about Palmer's, but I absolutely loathe the smell of cocoa butter.  I decided to give this product a try, and the main reason I chose it over others is that it's the ONLY one that (besides being organic and cold-pressed) comes in a glass container versus plastic.  Well, I have to say, it's amazing.  My skin absorbs it almost immediately, and it leaves me looking glowing and healthy - not oily or shiny.  I don't smell strongly of coconut, either.  The scent is very light, which is perfect for pregnant women whose sense of smell is on overdrive.  The oil doesn't have to be heated in any way to be used as a lotion: scooping a bit on your fingers and rubbing between your palms provides enough heat to make it easily spreadable.  And using it on your hair: wow!!!  My scalp stopped flaking and my hair has a lovely sheen without being greasy.  My hair has always been what I considered one of my best features, but I have to admit, running my hands through my hair after applying the oil to my body - just that little bit - really makes a difference.  Try this oil out for yourself, you will not be dissapointed. TL;DR Absolutely Wonderful for Skin & Body Care"
"I was drinking Yuban Organic medium roast coffee until I could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so I tried this instead.  What a let down after drinking the organic coffee.  This just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to Folgers but the organic stuff, now that's a different story. That stuff is good. Tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at Dunn Bros or Caribou coffee houses.  Don't believe me try both this and the organic version side by side.  You won't go back to this again I promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all. TL;DR Not as good as the Organic version"
"I have 2 sons, both picky and never like the same things.  To complicate matters, the younger one, 4, has life threatening allergies, including peanuts and tree nuts, therefore, our home is free of all products containing peanuts and tree nuts.  Prior to discovering my son's allergies, I lived off of peanut butter as my 'go-to' quick protein source.  We have tried numerous seed butters and other soy butters, but haven't been able to find one that all of us would eat, until now! This has more of a roasted flavor and a more peanutty texture than the others. We devoured 1/2 of a jar of wowbutter in one day.  I have ordered this 6 pack because the price is right and shipping indicates it will be here super fast.  Give it a whirl if your family is anything like ours - with a love for peanut butter but a need to eliminate it. TL;DR the best peanut butter alternative!"
"I discovered this soup several years ago.  Because I take medication for high blood pressure and therefore must limit my sodium intake, I always look for products that have lower salt in them.  For some reason, I haven't been able to find many Healthy Choice soups in markets for a couple of years.  I find them to have more home-cooked flavor than other name brand soups.  While I don't eat canned soups frequently, sometimes I just want a light meal & this one satisfies the need.  The Bean & Ham soup has an authentic home-made taste & consistency.  Like comfort food! It's also high in fiber, which is also a bonus.<br />If you want a filling, lower sodium, lower calorie soup, this one I highly recommend.  It's delicious! I was thrilled to find this on Amazon a while back & hope I'm able to get it for many years to come. TL;DR Just like homemade"
"I am so excited to see that Amazon sells the Starbucks VIA Iced Coffee! I never thought to look before now, and have been ordering it direct from Starbucks and paying their exorbitant shipping charges. I sucked it up because I have to have this coffee. I am not a fan of hot coffee, but I am an iced coffee junkie. I have been known to double fist the 32 oz iced coffees from McDonald's, I am that ridiculous.<br /><br />When the Starbucks Via Iced Coffee came out late last year, I couldn't wait to try it.  I first drank it just with cold water and ice.  It is already sweetened, so we are good to go there.  I missed my sweet, milky iced coffee from McDonald's, so I had to experiment a little bit.  I tried adding a little skim milk.  That helped, it tasted even better.<br /><br />Then I bought a gallon of 2% chocolate milk, and put a bit of that in instead of the regular milk. Oh my gosh! I have a better tasting iced coffee (in my opinion) than I can buy at any cafe.  It is so delicious, and I look forward to it every morning.  I think this VIA is made to be mixed with milk, it is strong so that the rich coffee flavor shines through even with milk mixed in.  When I run out of chocolate milk, I use skim milk with a good squeeze of Nestle Quick syrup, a good alternative.<br /><br />I have been trying to find a good iced coffee to make at home for several years, and this is it...I was brewing whole pots of hot coffee and trying to add ice and vanilla syrup, and coffee creamer...bleh, it was so much work and tasted half as good as this!  Give the VIA a try, you won't be disappointed! TL;DR I absolutely love it"
"This is the best stuff I could find to make a tincture of Green Dragon. If that's why you're here, look no further. After some investigation, I read that this is 90%. That should be plenty strong for Green Dragon ;) TL;DR Very Good Product"
"As a busy mom, I find myself running out of time, energy and good food choices pretty regularly. Usually when I grab something on my way out the door it ends up being convenient but full of carbs and empty calories. This trail mix, however, has a nice mix of healthy (yet tasty!) ingredients - whole almonds, honey roasted peanuts and sesame sticks, dark chocolate covered soy nuts, walnuts and pecans. The convenient, single-serving portion size is just right and is filling enough to leave you feeling satiated without needing another pack. Also, there aren't too many peanuts, which seems to be an issue with other trail mixes. I especially love the dark chocolate covered soy nuts which provide a hint of sweetness without being overpowering.<br /><br />The Daybreak Blend variety is really yummy, too, especially if you like a fruitier, sweeter taste. :) I keep a couple packets of the Daybreak Blend in my car since that kind doesn't contain anything that might melt. TL;DR Love this stuff!"
"I used to get this at the 7-11 for five cents each so it brought back memories from my childhood. When I was little, it came in all flavors.<br />This package was the same product and as good as I remembered, but it was<br />like a multi row of flavors for each bar. When I was little, each bar was a seperate flavor TL;DR Somewhat Diappointed"
"I wasn't much of a coffee drinker before. Once in awhile I'd go to Starbucks to get an iced coffee but that was probably once a month and for awhile not having any coffee at all for a year. So it's not something I drank much.<br /><br />I have tried some other instant coffees from my girlfriend but didn't like them so much.<br /><br />Then we tried the Starbucks VIA. The flavor of it is perfect for what I like! It's so easy to make. The instant coffee tastes better than anything I can buy at Starbucks so I never go and buy a coffee. This saves me a lot of money.<br /><br />Since I don't drink much coffee, one cup of this has enough ""kick"" to keep me up all day long.<br /><br />Now I drink a cup of coffee but I go running and it makes me feel like I can run much longer.<br /><br />So I would highly recommend this. Again I wasn't a two cup of coffee per day person but now 2-3 times a week, I enjoy a cup of Starbucks VIA. TL;DR I wasn't a big coffee drinker until I tried this. Now I'm hooked"
I use this product in baking as well as as a skin moisterizer. It is great. my daughter even mentioned that I had a glow to my skin and at 52 that is nice to hear. TL;DR Excellent product
"I couldn't disagree more with the previous review. No, they're not chocolate, they're soy. But they are delicious!! I find myself eating handfuls right out of the bag, but they are also great in cookies. They have a buttery, highly vanilla flavor, and a handful of them makes me think instantly of a Dairy Queen ice cream cone. If you love vanilla you should love these just as candy. TL;DR ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!"
"Easy on the waistline, easy to pack and go.<br />Flavorful, crisp, good for the munchies. TL;DR Great snack"
"I love these granola bars!  I can honestly say they are the best granola bars I've ever eaten.  They also have protein, and I love eating them just as a snack as well as if I'm on the go or post workout.  My only problem is they are hard to find in grocery stores...and I usually don't like to wait around to fill out a ""please stock this item"" form. TL;DR The best"
"Wow this one whisks up really nicely! Granted I am getting better at whisking and making a nice froth on top of my matcha but this one was easy peasy! I have noticed some matcha flavors mix more easily than others for some reason and since I do make more than one matcha many days its not just due to me being better one day versus another. This one whisked up to a very full forth quite easily! I note this because I know froth is really something many of us struggle with especially when we are new to matcha so I wanted to make a note of it for those of you who may feel deflated by not getting a good foam. Get this one and you can feel stellar! lol<br /><br />Now as for taste, I am not one who has had a lot of passion fruit in their life, other than in smoothies I have got from smoothie places and those are usually so riddled with sugars and other fruits picking out the passion fruit itself was a little difficult especially not having passion fruit in and of itself.<br /><br />Now I get to taste real passion fruit! Yay!<br /><br />It has a bit of this natural rind like flavor similar to that you sometimes get in a mango or papaya. Fruits I do have personal experience with. I like it though - it really compliments the natural grassy like flavor of the matcha base! And contrary to the smoothies I have had its not that sweet. There is a tart flavor to it but not bitter. It tastes REALLY healthy, and while matcha is always healthy sometimes I feel guilty having my dessert like matcha lol although I shouldn't such as my favorite butterscotch mathca makes me feel like I'm cheating haha this one makes me feel like I am really doing something good for my body and trust me my body needs all the help it can get!<br /><br />The aroma of this one is really quite nice! It is very eye opening and even if its only a mental thing I sure can use that in the mornings!<br /><br />There is the after taste of the rind like flavor but the passion fruit flavor makes my mouth water for more, literally, as if the juices itself are pulling out the watery mouth sensation! Its strange but nice. Its like having a mouth full of juicy passion fruit!<br /><br />So I drank half of my matcha straight, then added some sparkling italian water and some sweet cream non dairy creamer to make an italian soda and OMG goodness! The flavors ERUPT into a juicy fruit gum sensation which is similar in some ways to the brandy matcha I am going to review next! It is different though as the brandy also has alcohol notes to it whereas this one does not. This is like the virgin variable you give your kids while you have the brandy one haha. Except this has that lovely awakening rind flavor in the background that lingers in the after taste. TL;DR Does a body good!"
I ordered this for my daughter for mother's day and she absolutley loved it. The glass teapot was very danity and the joy of watching the tea bloom from a small clump to a gorgeous flower was amazing. I would recommend this for any tea lover. TL;DR Flowering Tea
I like this product very much but it's important to also follow the prices. I had to drop the rating down to 2 stars from 4.5 stars because of the drastic price increase.  The last time I bought it the price was $32.18.  An E-Mail advertisement arrived today at $47.55.  The price went up $15.37 which is an increase of 48%.  THAT'S OUTRAGEOUS!! TL;DR WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
"I have tried many hot sauces(Frank's, Texas Pete, tabasco, etc) and this one is the best.  Some sauces have heat.  Some have flavor.  This one has both.  It will add a very unique flavor to you food.  You wont be dissapointed. TL;DR Excellent"
"These Lazy Day dark chocolate ginger cookies are free of any gluten, wheat, dairy, and eggs.  You would think a cookie without these ingredients might taste like cardboard.  But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  While the cookie isn't crisp and tastes slightly stale, the flavors work well and it's a tasty treat.  The ginger is subtle.  The dark chocolate isn't of the highest quality, but still enjoyable.  If you require a cookie without these specific ingredients, you will likely be happy with this purchase. TL;DR Tasty cookie if you need a gluten-free or vegan option."
"My voice is my job. In the last months I felt a bit tired. My voice was a bit veiled. In some specialized Linkedin forums someone sayd this product is a sort of cure-all. So I bought it, but I was a bit skeptical. I was amazed by the positive effects on my voice. And now Throat coat tea is one of the most important working tools. TL;DR A great discovery"
"I like spice, so I was eager to try this product.  Generally, I like basic bottled Seven Seas or Kraft Italian dressing, but the name Taco Bell intrigued me.  I tried some on salad.  First of all, the dressing is extremely thick.  I didn't like its texture.  Flavor-wise, I found the dressing far overpowered the salad, made up of iceberg lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers.  The dressing is far too heavy, both in flavor and texture, for folks who enjoy fresh salads.<br /><br />What I tend to do with bottled Italian dressing is add black pepper.  This gives the dressing a nice kick but doesn't smother the gentle flavor of the vegetables.  The dressing might work as a dip for tortilla chips or crackers, but as a topping for salad, it gets a low score.<br /><br />Taco Bell is an immediately recognizable brand name in the fast food world, and the company is evidently using that popularity to have its name appear on items in the supermarket.  As far as Taco Bell's Bold & Creamy, Spicy Ranchero Sauce is concerned, I'd pass. TL;DR A bit too strong a flavor for salads"
"Has soy grits and flax in it, not what you expect in chips, and not adequately labeled as such when purchasing. Not the usual corn taste, although it has some health benefits. It's just not what I expected/wanted, and won't buy again. TL;DR The BAKED version of these chips is misleading and non-tasty"
"Low calorie for crackers, good taste, like how they are individually packaged per serving. TL;DR Crackers"
"My sister turned me on to this tea and I have to say it makes the most delicious iced tea I have ever tasted.  I love green tea, but I don't like to add sugar and sometimes I find tea made from teabags can taste bitter.  This tea has none of the bitterness and such great flavor.  Plus, it made me feel good when I drank it.  I have only had it iced so far, but I just ordered a 6-pack of it and the weather is getting cooler, so I can't wait to try it hot.  I don't know about the weight-loss claims, but I will soon see. TL;DR my favorite green tea yet"
"It is hard to get my 9 month old to eat vegetables, but luckily she likes this blend! As another review mentioned, it is pretty runny but I just thicken it up with rice cereal. I'm a little torn on what I think of packages like this - I am glad they are BPA free, and they are convenient for when we're out and about, but in general I prefer glass containers that we can recycle or reuse. TL;DR Very good"
"Another reviewer mentioned that perhaps the price is lower from this seller because the cans of Nido are nearer expiration. After receiving my 2-can package in the mail I would have to agree. I have purchased this at the supermarket with an expiration date 12-18 months away. These two, however, will expire just six months from now. Just something to be aware of if you are buying this intending it for longer-term storage.<br /><br />The milk itself is delicious. Much, much better than instant nonfat milks. Tastes very similar to 'real' milk and makes excellent hot chocolate! TL;DR good product, but not sure about seller/expiration date"
"I use this tea for support of high blood pressure. It offers the same benefits as other brands that cost 2 or 3 times as much.<br /><br />The taste is hibiscus tea - no better or worse than any other. If you want to pay 3 times the price to the producer to add some Stevia (not to my taste) and package it in a round tin can, go ahead. Or you can buy this one and sweeten yourself, or combine it with another tea.<br /><br />You won't find a better deal on an pretty rare herb tea. TL;DR Basic tea. Great price."
"I'm an old fashioned country girl that loves to cook. One of my favorite things to make and eat are homemade biscuits. I take a lot of pride in making them, and have to admit, I make a great biscuit. The only drawback is, that it takes time to make a perfect biscuit. Then I found a wonderful secret. Bisquick Complete Buttermilk biscuit mix. I bought a package and took it home. Unlike most other mixes, this one, you only add water. I gave it a try. Well guess what...these biscuits are just as good as mine, if not better. I was amazed at the homemade taste, how easy it was to make them, and only having to add water was the icing on the cake. These biscuits really are just as good as any great old fashioned country girl can make, they are very easy to make, and I now make these biscuits instead of my homemade ones, and none of my family has been able to tell the difference...but let's just keep that ""our little secret""...hehe...~ TL;DR Great old fashioned biscuits..."
"I love the plain coconut water no flavors! I was having leg cramps the were killing me ,and coconut water is the best for that!  I also would like to be a sales person for  coconut water  we do not have it here in the city of Williston  we do not have it in any of the stores here. TL;DR coconut saved my life"
"Looked all over the local stores and could not find these anywhere, just a mix nut.  These were flavorful and very delicious!!! TL;DR nuthatch"
"You can smell and taste the fresh blueberries. No buttery or greasy aftertaste or feeling on your fingers. Crunchy, yet makes no sound if you munch on it where you're not allowed to eat (hey, good to know!!!). Makes a great snack!!! TL;DR Fresh blueberry taste"
"Welcome to America.<br />I feed my dog things only made in the USA. Even better this is made in the state I'm living in! Wisconsin!<br />Also, my german shepherd loves it. TL;DR Made in Wisconsin!"
My dog refused to eat any of these.  I had to give them away.  Beware if your dog is picky. TL;DR dog refused
This is so much more than most chamomile teas.  It is flavored with other herbal ingredients for a wonderful cup of sleepy tea.  The price for three cans at Aamazon beats the price for two cans anywhere else.  I love this tea! TL;DR mellow and flavorful chamomile
"This is as good as fresh ginger, but..for a $3.99 jar they charged me $8.99 shipping and handling. I will not order this again from this merchant again! TL;DR Good product"
This is one of my favorite cereals and I'm very happy that Amazon offers it! TL;DR I love Wheat Chex
"Early April 2009 purchase: the item had an expiration of August 2009. Item was restocked shortly after my purchase, so orders made during spring 09 will most likely include fresh product. TL;DR Not Expired"
"We find that we use agave nector offen, just with this brand was a little less expencive.  We were pleased with this produce and would buy again if we could find it cheaper. TL;DR Great product"
Haven't order for a while but are as good as ever.  Product came promptly and was as advertised. Shared these with other employees who also enjoyed them. TL;DR SESAKISS SESAME SEEDS
"I have always LOVED Werther's, and to be able to order them online in Sugar-Free is wonderful !!!  I will keep repeating the order, and have the bags of this luscious candy delivered to my front door. TL;DR LOVE Werther's"
"Just received my case....  12 pack wasn't enough, I needed more b/c ive already gone through 8 bottles.  It's so refreshing!! TL;DR Refreshing"
sent these to my grandson and he loves them. great snack.  amazon as usual comes thru with great prices you just can't beat. TL;DR these are great
Great Swt/Sour sauce.  Use it to make sweet sour chicken and it's fabulous. Highly recommend it. Used it to replace chicken tonight from years ago. TL;DR Excellent Product
"Most kids like them, a few kids  don't, but I think they're great! At a slim 70 calories, and low on fat and sodium, they make a great snack for grown ups. Pretty healthy for kids too. TL;DR Love 'em"
"The EFAGold Coconut oil by Nature's Way is tasty and a great price!  It did leak during shipping, but not enough for me to make a hassle about it, since it was the only thing in the box. TL;DR great price & taste!"
I love this product (Ojai Lemonaise) and have been using it for years.  My family loves this product.  I use it to make tuna salad and chicken salad sandwiches.  Or anything I would use plain ol' mayo for.  Our favorite is to mix it in with a little melted butter for artichoke dipping. Yummy!  The only thing I hate is having to order it and have it shipped. TL;DR Ojai Lemonaise is the BEST!!!
"We were watching some cooking show when we heard about these tomatoes for the first time about a year ago. We found a ""certified"" brand at a nearby Wholefoods shortly thereafter but they were not available on a regular basis and we were absolutely hooked after having used them in several recipes. You notice this as soon as you open the can. It's like having a handful of freshly picked tomatoes in your hands. And the taste is amazing.<br /><br />Although these are not D.O.P. certified they are by far an excellent tomato and for the price an even better buy in comparison to what we can buy locally.<br /><br />We love Love LOVE these tomatoes. I am only sorry that they are not available on a subscribe and save basis. TL;DR Not your average canned tomato"
Please see the video of the treatment of the ducks at Elevages du Perigord factory farm in Canada before you consider buying this product.  The video can be seen online at [...] TL;DR Elevages du Perigord has been caught on video tape!
I ordered this for my husband's Christmas present on December 21st.  I really didn't think it would arrive in time and had printed a picture to give him until it arrived.  It arrived on the 23rd!!!! It was well packaged and was delivered intact. He is absolutely delighted with it.  He has a hot sauce collection and this is definately the piece de resistance! Thank you TL;DR Brilliant!
"A German friend, returning to his home in New York City after visiting with family in Frankfurt am Main, brought me back a gift box of ASBACH URALT Assorted Brandy-Filled Chocolates. That was about six years ago and I have been hooked ever since. I have tasted chocolates filled with liquor before, but the contents usually taste like alcohol, (the rubbing variety), made palatable only by the candy covering. For that reason I preferred my occasional after-dinner brandy in a snifter. Now, Asbach Uralt, which is recognized by connoisseurs to be the ultimate in liquor-filled chocolate, allows me to have my dessert along with a small taste of superb cognac in one bite. Actually, it is more like one long savoring session between me and a piece of chocolate.<br /><br />Hugo Asbach's company has been producing fine cognac, ""Weinbrand,"" since 1907 and it is this excellent brandy that is used to make the unique gourmet confection. A thin sugar crust separates the rich dark chocolate and the fine Uralt Asbach Brandy. It is important that the candy be consumed while fresh so the alcohol does not evaporate, and the middleman who sells this product through Amazon has consistently provided me with chocolates as fresh as I would get in Germany. I have ordered frequently over the years, for myself and for friends, as this makes a delicious and unusual gift.<br /><br />The Large Asbach Assorted Gift Box contains a variety of the liquor-filled chocolates. The assortment includes cherries marinated for over a year in Asbach brandy, praline, coffee and pure cognac. The chocolates are as fine as any I have had in Belgium and much less expensive. This is a real winner. 5+ Stars!<br /><br />JANA TL;DR Fine Brandy + Rich Dark Chocolate = A Decadent Delight!"
"When I was on amazon one day I had a craving for white chocolate and raspberries. When I saw Raspberry White Chocolate Truffles, I knew I had to get it. I ordered it right before Thanksgiving time. The shipping was pretty good. It arrived when I was expecting it to. I thought the product itself was awesome. I gave some to my brother and sister and really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this product to anybody that loves white chocolate and raspberries. TL;DR Awesome"
For instant coffee it's pretty good.  Of course brewed coffee is richer but sometimes it's nice to be able to get a quick cup.  It's also handy for flavoring in recipes.  It's important to use organic coffee because coffee is one of the crops that's heavily sprayed with pesticides etc. TL;DR pretty good coffee
"I love this peanut butter.  Problem is,  none of the stores near me carry it.  And I can get it here,  online for a little cheaper than the next closest place that does carry it and it gets delivered to me.  :)  I like the creamy texture of the peanut butter that just kinda melts in your mouth. TL;DR Yummy!"
"I bought this because it was a pretty good deal, and I'm completely satisfied with my purchase. I didn't find any unhulled millets in the whole package. It's very easy to cook and the taste is great. I'll definitely buy it again! TL;DR Very clean hulled millets"
"We love this tuna!  A while back our store revamped itself and stopped carrying Genova.  We asked them if they would bring it back, but so far it hasn't happened.  So when we found we could order it through Amazon.com we jumped at the opportunity.  Thank you.  Now we're going to order another case so we won't run out.  Life is Good TL;DR The Best Tuna Ever"
"The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor. TL;DR Kids Love 'Em!!"
"This is a very good cat food; high quality and eagerly gobbled up by 8 picky cats at our house.  Be aware that it is $10 cheaper for the same sized bag at Walmart.  Jest sayin'..... TL;DR Good, but way over-priced"
"I ordered these for a 50's themed event with other various candies and they were perfect!  People were crazy about them. They were just as I remembered as a kid, chalky and good! TL;DR Just like the good ol' days!"
"These are, hands down, the best jelly beans on the market.  There isn't a gross one in the bunch and each of them has an intense, delicious flavor.  Though I hesitate to pick a favorite, I have to say that I love green apple, a rare flavor in drugstore jelly beans.  Each flavor tastes like the fruit it is modeled after, not like the tart candy version of that fruit.  I even love the cherry flavor, and I hate cherry flavored candy.  I don't find them similar to Starburst candy, so don't let that put you off if you're not a fan.  Overall, they are delicious, perfectly-sized, crunchy yet smooth little morsels of fruit flavor. TL;DR Best beans your money can buy"
"I'm a big fan of Starbucks. When they decided not to continue making coffee for t-discs, I was very disappointed. I like bold and extra bold coffees and I think Starbucks has the best... until I tried the Dark House Blend from Gevalia. The flavor is so rich and bold (but not burnt) that I can't wait to get up in the morning so I can have the coffee! I still have some starbucks t-discs at home (from 6 months ago), and comparing with Gevalia Dark House Blend, the starbucks tasted like water. I rarely say this... but thank you, Gevalia, for making this great dark blend coffee. Definitely my favorite Gevalia so far. TL;DR The best dark roast I've ever had. Even better than Starbucks!"
"This product is 100% juice with no additives to speak of. That makes it natural and healthy. Good. The drink is also carbonated, which is what I like, so that is good. The can is small, so it isn't so much a thirst quenching drink as it is a dose of vitamin C in liquid form. Bad (but good). The flavor selection is exotic and quite different from typical everyday colas and flavored waters. Good. But surprisingly, this drink was quite bland and left a bitter aftertaste, possibly from the carbonation. Bad. If I could drink this on a regular basis at the same price as my usual Diet Coke or Pepsi One, I might consider going for it, but I have a feeling that it would be pricier than a typical cola. Bad. So, with three stars as the base of an average drink, we have four goods and three bads, pushing this to a middling 4 star rating. In short, it's fine but isn't anything to get excited about. TL;DR Let's weigh the good and the bad of Switch"
"Good product - have used saccharin for over 20 years and this is the one. I ordered a case of 12 bottles (1/4 grain equals one teaspoon of sugar), however, I only got 10. When I emailed they gave me back the money for the two without even asking if this is what I wanted. I didn't, I wanted 12 bottles. So, now I have to buy 2 more and I can't get just 2 at the price they returned to me. I would have rather returned them and ordered a box of 12 from another seller.  So, product is good  would recommend it but buy from a different seller!!!!! TL;DR good product - crummy seller"
"My shitzu Maxwell, just loves the flavor of the chicken yams... he waits every morning for his favorite treat.. and its so hard to get stores in my area to carry them.. so I am thankful to see I can order them here thru Amazon.com  my pup thanks you..... :) TL;DR My dog just loves these chicken wrapped yams!!!"
"I am a coffee fanatic and drink it for the taste, all natural from a french press. I have tried many different kinds here on Amazon and can say that Weavers full bodied is truly the best with flavor that is not too bitter and not sour, you do have to know how to make it right... TL;DR The Best"
"Ok...maybe not love- But I really really like it. 1. This gives me a good energy boost, with zero jitters and no crash. (I get jittery and crash with coffee, red bull, five hour energy...)<br />2. It has a sour flavor that I really do like.<br />3. The stuff goes a long way- Just one or two squirts per bottle of water.<br />4. I love that I can keep it in my gym bag and use a couple squirts before I work out.<br /><br />I actually love all the Mios (Lemonade and Sweet tea are my favorites.) TL;DR LOVE it"
I LOVE these seeds they are my habit like cigarettes are to most people.  I was paying over $2/bag at walmart i'm glad i found this online.  Only complaint i have is that when i ran out so early i didnt have the money to order another case til today but my old subscription wouldnt have shipped til May 23rd so i had to cancel and re-scubscribe.  The seeds themselves have been great so far i havent gotten a bad batch so far like other reviews i've read. TL;DR awesome product
"Let me add my 5 stars to this products rating. I tried some of the Grade A syrup, and didn't like it on my hot cakes or with my lemonade cleanse diet drink. After reading the posts on this Grade B syrup I decided to give it a try. I could not believe how great it tasted, and it really improved the taste of the drink. Just ordered two more 32 oz bottles. Before I placed my second order tonight I found an off brand of Grade B MS at a local store I shop at once in a while. It was 14.00 for a 13 oz bottle, that convinced me what a great buy this was, and with the order of two there is no s/h charges! TL;DR Great buy, and great taste"
Just tried mallow bites in my hot cocoa and it was out of this world!  Where have you been all of my life?  These would also be great in cocoa krispies treats.  The possibilities are endless... TL;DR Chocolate covered marshmallows in hot cocoa
Delicious Coffee. Good value at the 6 pack. Win - Win. It is organic too. TL;DR Best instant coffee
"I had the opportunity to digest a box of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal with a Hint of Brown Sugar, and the name of the product pretty much sums up whats in the box. To be honest, it is what it says it is, but not much more.  The product had a good crunch and the brown sugar flavoring tasted as it was.  But it struck me as sweet - maybe too sweet, to get the whole impact of the flavor.  Or, said another way, there wasn't any rich tones to what I was tasting, no nuances to the flavors. Would I buy it at the store?  Probably not.  The fiber content were higher, or maybe if they combined the brown sugar flavor with the cinnamon flavor there would be an encouragement to try it.  But as it stands, my month with the cereal wasn't one in which I looked forward to buying another box.  It was more like trying to get through the one I had. TL;DR Its not bad, but it doesn't satisfy"
My doberman LOVES the primal dry roasted dog treats and they are rated one of the healthy snacks for dogs on Whole-Dog-Journal! TL;DR delicious and healthy
"I'm not a coffee snob.  I can tell that there is a difference between Kenyan and Columbian, but I can't tell you which is which without a label.  This decaf tastes good.  I like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream; the coffee flavor isn't subdued by these additions.  The bag ultimately required scissors to open.  The blurb for this says ""(pack of 3)""; I only got one bag.  Not sure why that is; it's happened before with other products.  Would I buy this again?  Sure, if it was on sale . . . that's how I buy my coffee most of the time. TL;DR A decent cuppa"
Just started keeping kosher. Boy were these things a great find! As tasty or tastier *gasp* than dairy chips. Great strong chocolate flavor. TL;DR awesome!!!
"I wanted to buy a large container of taco seasoning that I could use in my recipes, and here it was.  So much easier than buying numerous little packs from a grocery store.  Good flavor, too.  When I run out of it, I'll buy the same product again. TL;DR GREAT PRODUCT"
"After fighting every morning over our lone coffee maker (and not wanting to invest in a K-cup machine), I decided to try this instant coffee for my caffeine-free husband.  He no longer cheats on his doctor's orders.  He said this is absolutely, positively the best instant coffee Ever (and he's a coffee snob), and finds it comparable to the brewed variety. TL;DR A True Delight"
The carton of 24 arrived completely melted.  I guess it was stored in an non-air conditioned environment in transit.  The company should mark the product as perishable.  It was awful!  Never again unless it is below freezing weather. TL;DR Only order in the dead of winter!
Love this product. Low Salt and a solid product. The taste is great.  Will continue to purchase abd refer to my friends. TL;DR Great Healthy Salmon
"I tried writing a review previously but I focused on how recieving a bottle w a busted cap and dents on my product didnt make me super happy. I wasnt going to have a container once I took off the foil cause the cap was busted...so I got a plastic container and dumped syrup in there for storage. Tonight,  I made a mint julep w the syrup. Its wasnt a HORRIBLE drink, but its not a mint julep to me. It just didnt taste like the ones Ive had. Taste combined w a shabby bottle didnt work for me. TL;DR Wasn't what I anticipated"
"The first box I got of these were great with very fresh tasting nuts; however, the second box was not so fresh and some of the bars had a stale taste.  Nothing worse than a stale nut--can't get that taste out of your mouth.  I guess I'll give it one more try before I cancel my Subscribe & Save for this product. TL;DR Not consistently fresh"
"My 3 dogs love it - when they finish eating, they look to me for more.  They highly recommend this item. TL;DR Dogs Love It"
"I was so excited to find these on Amazon; I have been waiting for a company to start growing GF oats, that are also organic, for so long!  High praises to the Gluten Free Oats company for being the first (to my knowledge) in offering these.  It just seems logical that folks who have food intolerances and/or allergies, would also be very conscientious about the quality of their food.  So it baffles me why so many GF foods are not also organic.  So glad this company took the initiative.  My Celiac daughter and I were so delighted to have oatmeal for the first time in years. The oats are very fresh tasting and cook up nicely for oatmeal.  The oats cooked up nicely in pancakes too.  I pre-soaked them in rice milk and the result was that the oats completely blended in and there was no discernible texture to the oats once the pancakes were cooked.  I actually would have preferred a little texture, so next time I will make pancakes without pre-soaking the oats.<br /><br />The only issue I had was that the bag had ""popped"" open during shipping.  It was packed with other items and a heavy item probably squished the bag until it popped.  So sad to see 1/3+ of a bag wasted, but Amazon was great and quickly sent me a new bag.  I intended to order another bag or two tonight, but see that they are already out of stock!  Guess I'm not the only one who has been waiting for organic, GF oats. TL;DR Organic Gluten Free Oats!!!"
"Ghirardelli has truly outdone itself. This mix turned out a great batch of brownies, earning high praise from my husband and daughter, and it was so easy! The brownies have walnut bits in them which add to the already rich chocolate flavor, and they are deliciously chewy and moist, even after I stored them in the refrigerator for a couple of days. I also tried out the Ghirardelli double chocolate mix and they were great too. I'm sticking to this brand to satisfy my family's brownie craving from now on! TL;DR Yummilicious!"
"I ordered this screen so I can keep my French doors open in the spring and fall without having tons of bugs get in the house.  It truly does install in minutes- just slide the screen onto the tension rod, open your doors and place the rod at the appropriate height for your doors.  The added velcro helps keep the sides in place.  I think that overall the magnets do a great job of keeping the opening closed, but it is a good idea to just make sure it closed properly after you go through the doorway.  No, it doesn't automatically close perfectly without help every single time, but come on people- it is a screen with magnets for less than a hundred bucks- you have to give it credit for doing the intended job so well even if it isn't perfect!<br />For me, the length and width was perfect. I feel like the screen material looks nice and is of good quality, and the opening functions well enough for the purpose.  I think I paid a fair price for a good product that I am getting lots of use out of.  I would purchase this product again, or in different sizes for my other doors. TL;DR As advertised- fits and works great, super easy!"
"Our dog has destroyed nearly every other toy we have given her. So far, this Dino bone and the kong are the only two that have lasted.I would recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog who is a heavy chewer. TL;DR Perfect Dog Toy"
"For the price is coffee is pretty good, I like a strong cup and it does a good job. I have been using it for about 6 months now and have it on auto ship. Give it a try. TL;DR Great coffee"
"Unlike all of the newer products that have recently hit the market with Stevia, Stevia, Stevia! all over their packaging, this one is and always has been 100% Stevia extract.  Don't be fooled by all of those other ""natural"" brands that only use some stevia and then put in all the other stuff that isn't good for us. TL;DR 100% Stevia Extract"
Unlike the conventionally grown dried apricots I bought at the grocery store these apricots are not just sweet but also have a delicious unique flavor I can describe only as oriental - they are from Turkey. TL;DR moist and tastes great
I just received my order three days ago and these oats are very good.  They taste better then the ones in the stores that have added artificial sweeteners and are better for you! TL;DR VERY good!
These cookies are good if you like them WITHOUT almonds.  I ordered the Little Dutch Maid Almond Windmill Cookies and cannot see or taste even the tiniest hint of an almond in any of them.  very disappointing. TL;DR Where are the almonds?
"This would be a good coffee drink to have on hand.  I did chill it in the refrigerator, and since I don't drink espresso with sugar, I placed this in a cup and added a bit of milk, and liked it better that way.  The milk softened the sugar taste a bit and the bitterness of the espresso.  All in all, a nice beverage. TL;DR Handy Coffee Drink"
I mixed this coffee with some regular coffee and it made a super treat for an early morning coffee. This flavor is so good. I will order some more. To me a lot of regular coffee seems a bit bitter and adding a flavoring makes it a treat. TL;DR great coffee
"this and Amy&Brian's coconut juice are my favorite. I've also tried vita coco, O.n.e. and generic brands. Blue monkey is also the cheapest i've found on amazon at $0.10 an ounce using subscribe and save. i find this to be a better serving size than 17 ounce Amy&Brian cans at 11.2 ounces for Blue monkey. Definitely recommend. TL;DR tasty and inexpensive"
"I can't even begin to enumerate the uses I've found for this amazing product. Mix it with a little flax seed oil for a sweet, healthy dressing. Marinate chicken or seafood, bake, and it will turn into a sweet glaze. Mix it into stir fries. Add it to sweet potatoes, carrots, butternut squash, or any other sweet-ish veggie instead of sugar. Fry up some chopped bacon, caramelize some onions in the bacon grease, and use the Honey Ginger Condiment to deglaze the pan for an amazing sauce to put on nearly any vegetable, such as french green beans, asparagus, broccoli, snow peas, or sugar snaps.<br /><br />Honey and Ginger Condiment by Acetum is vinegar based, but has a complex sweetness with just a hint of ginger. The sweetness curbs some of the astringency of the vinegar flavor, making it quite mild and versatile. I buy 2 bottles at a time to ensure that I never run out! TL;DR Slightly sweet, slightly astringent, extremely delicious!"
"I want to know why it is that Amazon does not provide label information (ingredients and nutritional information) for the food products it sells???  It is ridiculous to not have this information readily available to consumers.  I for one will not buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it, which most things seem to have these days.  Not being able to find out the ingredients easily turn possible purchases like this one into an absolute NO from Amazon.  If I have to go somewhere else to get the information then I will buy it somewhere else as well. TL;DR No Label information"
"I'll assume most people looking to buy almond butter on Amazon already know how much healthier it is than peanut butter. If not, Google can tell you in five seconds. (Remember, almonds are nuts, peanuts are not.) But for those of you still picking peanut butter because it tastes better, stop here. Barney Butter tastes as good as peanut butter and, in my opinion, tastes even better. Buy this butter and be healthier. That is all.<br /><br />P.S. Most every almond butter I've tried always has oil at the top of the jar. Yucky. You have to stir it until you break your hand to get it mixed back in with the butter. And then the next time you get into the jar you have to do it all over again. Not so with Barney Butter. No oil. No yucky. Just good eating. TL;DR Makes Peanut Butter Unnecessary"
"Although I like olives, often I only want 3 or 4 due to their intense flavor. These olives have a great flavor that keeps you coming back for more. I love to snack on them at work and have no problem finishing the whole package each time. TL;DR Delicious!"
"I like a mild-flavored tea, so this suits me.  I also re-use the bag at least once, and I am happy with the flavor.  Definitely a good deal. TL;DR Nice flavor"
"on our resident fat cat, Simon.  Since last year we have been working to lower Simon's weight by lowering his calorie content. He has gone from 19 lbs 2 oz a year ago to 17 lb 14 ounces. I did the research and found that this formula is among the lowest in Kcal per cup.  Simon and his housemates had no difficulty with adjusting to this food.  When I put the empty bag on the floor last night, Simon crawled into the bag and licked the sides. Yeah its that good.  The morsels are a good size and allow even my petite female and my boy who is missing some teeth, the ability to easily eat it. Our other kitties also have slimmed down a bit too.  The only reason that I did not give it five stars is not the quality but the price, which is on the high side even when compared to other ""diet"" cat foods. TL;DR We broke the 18 lb mark"
We love these Biodegradable Trash bags for our bathroom waste baskets. They are the perfect size and are compostable so less goes in the landfill. TL;DR Great for waste baskets
"Very good product.  Works really well. No issues.  Turns good with zero problems.  Like the style, looks great next to my K Brewer.  Would recommend to those who want an inexpensive K cup holder that looks and works well. TL;DR Nifty Carousel for 35 K-Cups, Chrome"
"I've had a lot of excellent halva in my life. It's seems it would be difficult to spoil it, but not in this case. It is a disgrace to call this product a halva! Granulated Domino Sugar - yes, but not a halva. It has a lot more sugar than any other brand and all you can feel are crunchy sugar crystals when you're chewing it. Do not buy! TL;DR Plain SUGAR..."
"I loved these cookies! They are chewy and moist, and the raisins are not hard or gummy they are very fresh and plump! They bring back memories of grandmas kitchen... TL;DR Just like grandma used to make!!!"
"Just returned from a trip to Scotland where I was introduced to Branston Pickle by our most-gracious host.  I love this stuff.  It's got tang.  It's got crunch.  It's got lots of flavors.  As a vegetarian I am always looking for ways to make vegetables more interesting.  Due to the ridiculous weight and ""liquid"" restrictions on the airlines, I could bring home only one jar of Pickle so I am delighted to find it is available on Amazon! TL;DR Great Stuff!"
"I've always loved chocolate covered raisins. Dark chocolate covered raisins are even better. Nestles may not be the best, but they're still delicious. I just keep telling myself the raisins make them healthier. TL;DR My favorite ""junk"" food"
"You see this hot sauce very popular at most oriental restaurants.  Not only because of the low price but because of its terrific flavor.  You get 17oz (compare that with the skinny tabasco bottle) of hot spice that will last for a very long time.  Great especially for soup lovers who want to spike it up a notch.  Also good with your pizzas, burritos, nachos, ... and more. TL;DR Great Chili Sauce - Great Price"
"Although the price initially seems a bit more than other cat foods, if you add water to it like the instructions say, you end up saving a lot of money...possibly up to the thousands in vet's bills (I recently spent $3,200 because my cat got sick from contaminated food...watch out for Nutro dry cat food. Many pet owners have has sick/dead pets becasue of it). My boys like the taste, especially when mixed with Evolution Moist Food. I tried it (something I'd never do with ordinary, sick-animal by product totally gross food) and it's quite tasty! We are now an Evolution family for life. It's an ethical, small company, and I like what they stand for and what they produce. TL;DR Great food at a good price!"
"My cat, Sterling, is a rather picky chap and, after trying what I thought were every affordable and healthy canned cat food in my area, I finally stumbled upon this one. My cat loves every flavor but turkey, though I doubt it's the brand, he just doesn't like turkey. Anyway, my usual pet store is sadly taking these off the shelves, so I supose I'll be buying it here. This food is well rounded and (according to my cat) delicious. He is a discerning fellow, after all. TL;DR Cat loves it"
My all time favorite tea.  I was thrilled to discover that I can buy it year round (stores only carry it during the holidays). TL;DR Best tea ever!
"The right combination of sweet and spicy, perfect on Brie and crackers.  I never thought about cooking with this, but since I found it at Costco for $7.99 (twice the amount that comes in the jar) it would be wonderful on chicken or some seafood. TL;DR This stuff is fantastic"
"I bought this sauce as a closeout. I thought my husband would like the spicy honey mustard. He did, but now I am addicted and trying to find a source to purchase more in my area of the mid-west.<br /> The best description is the flavor is complex with several different notes. First you get sweet, then a sour and spicey but fruity undernote followed by a nice but not too hot burn. Also the sauce has a great texture with pieces of onion complementing the flavor.<br />  Great sauce, if I had one complaint...why so many artificial ingredients, i.e hydrolized protien, etc..?? TL;DR Best sauce EVER!"
labeling says one serving has 11 grams of fat but less than one gram saturated. since most of the fat comes from coconut oil the saturated fat should be quite high like in comparable banana chip products. i called them and emailed them about this. they said they'd get back to me but never did. i  love their banana chips but the labeling is definitely incorrect about the saturated fat content. TL;DR confusing label
"I read many diverse reviews for this product, but I believe it only works if you use it properly. I learned that it not only about taking a pill, you got to make sure you eat extra food and drink extra liquids. Also timely pumping or breastfeeding is very important too. I noticed, as soon I'd start extracting or taking pills at different times, milk amounts would start messing up. So I started pumping 4 times a day, every 6 hours, day or night, and it became stable and enough for a baby. It is truth that pills give a gas, not only baby, but I was gassy too, but I started taking smaller dose than written on package, 4 pills a day- every time I'd pump. Supply was still good, but a baby wasn't as gassy. Later on as she got bigger, it was unnoticeable, rather I'd say it was due to a food (pickles, cabbage, etc). Most importantly, I believe breast feeding was more valuable over gas issue. I've met so many women who were just too lazy to give their babies what is best for them. TL;DR Worked well for us!"
"I, personally, am not a big pumpkin spice person.  I like pumpkin pie, ice cream, etc. but the pumpkin and spice coffee somehow just doesn't do it for me.  During the Fall I usually get one or at the most two pumpkin related drinks, then I'm done until next season.  I mostly got this because my girlfriend loves pumpkin spice flavored coffees from places like Starbucks.  I tried it and thought the flavor was a little weird tasting, not bad necessarily - but strange none the less.  I couldn't finish my cup.  My girlfriend said she thought the mixture was way too heavy on the spice side and very little pumpkin flavoring.  Although she finished her cup, she said she wouldn't want to drink anymore.  There must be a big difference in this and the coffee house drinks, since my girlfriends still drinks those all of the time.  Somehow I either got a bad mixture or these are just being made with too much spice.  Personally I'd say it's worth trying, but if you are looking for a premium pumpkin coffee alternative - look elsewhere. TL;DR Too Much Spice, Not Enough Pumpkin"
"This mayo is tops!  Just right on many traditional Japanese dishes such as Takoyaki or Okonomiyaki...also perfect on pizza, burgers, even steamed veggies!  I bought mine at the asianfoodgrocer site for around $7 including shipping; my Takoyaki never had it so good! TL;DR Yummie!"
"The juniper plant I received died within a month of planting.<br />After I did some research, I found that it does the best outside of the home, which Eve's Garden failed to mention in the product instructions.<br />I gave it one star because it shipped well and was fun while it lasted. I will not be getting anything from this manufacturer again. TL;DR Disappointment"
"The package arrived as estimated well packaged  went well with game and movie night, plenty to go around for weeks.  A great late night snack TL;DR Great"
"What can I say this is totally my own viewpoint but I LOVE this stuff. To me heating is optional. I have to buy this at a health food store 20 miles away from me but I make the trek every month and stock up. I usually by every can they have (like 6) I have a very hard time not eating the entire can in one sitting. Good gracious I love this Stuff! Oh and when they say spicy buttermilk sauce, it's really a highly spiced sauce not a hot sauce. one word: YUM!!!!!!!!! A note of caution though, I have a lactose intolerance and suffer minor stomach and digestive issues when I eat this. Probably because I ate the entire can. If you are moderately or severely lactose intolerant you may want to avoid this. Try the Dehli Saag instead. Also incredibly yummy! I'm glad to have found it on Amazon TL;DR Gimmie a can opener and a spoon!"
"This is awful.  So, I got out the pots and pans and made a great no salt, little sugar and no butter fat tomato Soup using fresh tomatoes.  Tastes much, much better than this Tomato Soup! TL;DR Yucky and way too sweet"
"Campbells is the best of the canned Manhattan CC's.  Bookbinders clams are dry.  Progresso is so-so.  When I was a kid you could always get this in the grocery stores in Chicago.  I never see it out here in Tucson.  One place carried it for a while and then stopped.  I've asked various grocers if they could order it for me by the case, but they said no.<br /><br />Add a can of chopped clams to this and some more boiled potatoes & carrots, maybe a bay leaf and some tabasco & it is as good as it gets short of all out home-made. TL;DR best canned manhattan CC"
"Great product - brought it for a gift and will be buying some more for me.  User friendly product, easy to use and works with any kcup machine TL;DR Disposable K-Cups for Keurig Brewers"
"The granola on the outside make these more appealing than just a flavored rawhide.  I uploaded 4 photos to show the rawhide below the granola layer.<br /><br />In sum - my dog will be getting these for the rest of her life.  She loves them, and rawhide keeps her teeth healthy, so it's a no brainer.<br /><br />This is probably her favorite rawhide treat.  She also loves the regular Busy Rollhide, but the Busy Chewnola is even better. TL;DR A long-lasting dog favorite"
I love this coffee! It is nice and bold and not bitter! I like my coffee more robust and strong and this is it! TL;DR The best strong coffee
"My son loves this cereal, especially with chocolate soymilk. This company also makes Koala Crisp Cereal, if we have that, my kids will mix the Panda Puffs with the Koala Crisp (which has a chocolate flavor) as they think it tastes like a Reese Cup. I like that there are only 7g of sugar per serving (much less than many kids cereals) and all the ingredients are organic. Once in milk this cereal will also stay crispy a little longer than Rice Crispies, but not much. If you have to make Rice Crispy treats for the school bake sale - use these cereals instead for an extra yummy treat. TL;DR Yummy!"
"My dog is 3 years old and a very picky eater. These are her favorite treats. She is a 7 lb Yorkie, so I cut the treats in about 6 pieces. They last much longer that way and she will actually not take a whole one anymore because they are too big. TL;DR My pups love these"
"My cats wouldn't eat them even without pills in them. I have one cat who is fussy so this wasn't a surprise, but I have another cat who will eat anything on the floor, including non-food items, but would not touch these ""treats."" TL;DR Just Awful"
"My husband and I love dried fruit for our snack. We love this brand but sometimes hard to find in the store. I'm grateful for the price, too (it lasts long, don't mind buying bulk). TL;DR Great snack"
"I purchased this product and the seasoning is very good. I am, however, very dissapointed with their shipping charges. I had sent the seller an email stating that their shipping charge was excessive ($7.50) for such a small item. I received no response. The spice jar (3.5oz) arrived in a small box sent via USPS, and the USPS label on the front showed the cost of $2.38 for shipping. So faerie's finest makes an extra $5.12 on S&H. I suggest they notice that part of Amazon.com's success is due to the fact that they charge straight shipping costs, not inflated S%H. I won't buy from faeire's again. TL;DR Excessive shipping charges"
"I get this olive oil through Subscribe and Save and really like it.  It has a good flavor and is great for baking, frying, etc.  I even like the tins, and I use a can opening to remove the tops when the tins are empty and use them for cute storage.  The price has gone WAY up recently though, which is really frustrating. Amazon has a history of jacking the price up on anything that sells well or gets good reviews. I depended on my regular shipments for my cooking needs and now I need to look for another affordable replacement until Amazon puts the price back down in the normal range (if they do). TL;DR Price has skyrocketed"
"This was a magical box of mixed K-cups full of the most excellent and delicious flavors of coffee one could conceive.  Every flavor in the package was exceptionally delicious.  Also, there were quite a few of the limited edition or seasonal varieties in here, but none of the weird ones that nobody ever drinks.  I bought this for a gift but I'll be ordering another for me to enjoy.  When I opened the package and started reading all the flavors, I kept trying to talk my wife into letting me steal a few out of the box before wrapping it :)  I guess it is random who gets what varieties but I'm glad I ignored the other reviews and purchased this.  None of my K-cups were broken and there was a pretty even variety. TL;DR Just Fantastic!!!"
"Here I thought I was getting Two Large Tubs...was I sadly mistaken.  I received two Short, small tubs.  NOT as advertised!  Tastes good, but company should be honest about packaging. TL;DR NOT as advertised!"
My kids love these sucker. They are a million times better than any other. I don't feel so guilty giving these to them. TL;DR amazing!
"This is just one of two types of canned fruit from Roland that I do NOT like.  It's like they picked totally unripened  pineapples and just sliced and packed them in the unripened fruit juices.  They are really quite awful!  The one and only can I opened... I ended up throwing out 75 % of it.  The remaining 11 cans I plan to use in making smoothies or on top of hams being cooked or anywhere that pineapples are just a secondary article in the cooked product.  When I bought other company's products, I use to love just opening a can and eating several slices for a sweet, delicious desert.  You can not do that with these tasteless, hard, bitter, totally unsweet cans of fruit.  I will not be buying this particular canned fruit from Roland ever again but they do make many other canned fruits that are scrumptious so, along with the awful Kiwi, I will add this to my 'DO NOT BUY' list!!!  Maybe they were having an ""OFF"" production cycle but it does not justify selling this crap to us consumers. TL;DR I was disappointed in this can of fruit!"
"While I love the coffee, and the service was as well, I hate being forced into writing more than is necessary.  Thanks TL;DR Great coffee and great service"
"The cheese has a very creamy texture, even for a NY cheddar that I would put more in line with Gouda. Typically aged cheddars seem sharp with a hint of cream but this had a very strong chocolate overtone which is the unexpected part and followed by the typical creaminess. It's pretty unique if you're new to aged or exotic cheeses. I would say this cheese pairs well with an aged Riesling or a milk stout if you prefer beer.<br /><br />I ate it straight but think this would go well on a saltier cracker or toast. TL;DR Unexpected for a NY cheddar"
"This is a very tasty meal, and I would recommend it with either white rice or bread. Note that it is a little spicy (for my palate)! TL;DR Very good prepacked food"
"If you like the soft type of gummy bears rather than the more chewy kind (like Haribo), you will love these.  They have a wide variety of flavors that really taste different, unlike some generic brand gummy bears that have different colors, but taste very similar.  These favorably compare to the old Amazin Fruit gummy bears that used to be popular.<br /><br />These bears are delicious! TL;DR Great flavors, very soft,  excellent gummy bears!"
"Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.  Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis.  A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing.  I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results.  I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food.  I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity.  I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it.  This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />*  Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />*  Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />*  Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />*  Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />*  Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />*  High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco, where I purchased it, or head to the Natural Balance website.  Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals.  You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat.  I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic.  I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days! TL;DR Both my cat and I LOVE Natural Balance ... she is happy, healthy, and this food helps minimize the hairball activity!"
"If your cat needs to take pills, these pockets work great! My 16-year old cat needs to take a steroid pill daily and he does so willingly when I put them in these pockets. They come in two flavors and both work well. Highly recommended! TL;DR Pill pockets for cats"
"Oh man, I love me some peach rings.  Haribo brand peach rings are quite good, in small doses.  I find their flavor to be stronger than most, which is good, but I also can't plow through pounds of them at a time like I can some other brands.  Still, the flavor is excellent, and the quantity here is even more fantastic.  Just be sure to seal them up nice and tight or they might go bad before you finish. TL;DR Nom Nom"
"Classic Zotz fizzy sour candy - kind of like Pop Rocks in a hard candy, or a lozenge filled with sour Pixy Stix powder.  The box contains 48 strings of 4 individually wrapped pieces, for a total of 192 pieces.  This is basically the same as the Zotz candy that was popular back in the 1970s, but it's now imported from Italy.  The flavors in the box I received from Amazon Grocery weren't as pictured in the item listing (cherry/orange/lemon/lime); instead, it contained equal numbers of cherry (red), apple (green), and watermelon (pink). TL;DR Zotz the way I like it"
"i ordered caffeine free tea bags. the box that was shown said caffeine free on it. my box does not- the writing on the front is different than the box shown and nowhere on the box does it say caffeine free. i attempted to contact seller but when i clicked on the sellers name it told me there were no matches. there is also no royal king web site for me to read nutrition facts, and the other sites that list caffeine content do not have info on this product. TL;DR wrong product?"
"These Zingers are far better than any twinkie or cup cake. They are so delicious they are addictive and i ate a whole box of them in one day. The vanilla ones are good but, these devil food ones are sublime and the service was fast and the product was packaged well. TL;DR fanasticly delicious!"
"What I received didn't mention the word ""reishi"" on the packaging, in contrast to the product description, it was labeled ""Dried Linch"", so I have no idea what I received.  Under ""Ingredients"" it lists dried linch and sulfites as a preservative. The item is not eligible for return. TL;DR Ambiguous labeling--what is it?"
My 5 month old aussie/border collie mix puppy liked this game a lot. It's pretty durable. You hide the treats in the cups and your pup has to find them. I think the best part about this game is that it is 3 games in 1. Some of the games were easier for him to understand how to play quicker than others. My puppy was able to learn all 3 of the games pretty quickly. The instructions and set up are simple. I wish there were more of the green cups though. One more note i got mine from CVS for 13$ and change...but that was the first time i have seen a dog game sold in mainstream stores so buying online form amazon might be a good option if you dont feel like store hopping to try to find it. Overall i am happy with my purchase and love the idea of playing games with my puppy! TL;DR Fun game for dogs
The product itself is good. Supposed to be different fruit flavors but I can't tell the difference. However my local grocery has these for $2 each and had a $1 off coupon a while ago. I suppose if you can't find them anywhere then you might have to pay this price... TL;DR Check you local grocery first
"I was a little disappointed to find that the amount of spice is actually quite small. I find it difficult to figure out size and weighting with spices on line because some of it can depend on packaging.  But with the cut of the spices, you really only get about 1.5 T of spices.  Flavors and blend are otherwise good though I was further disappointed to find that this blend lacks Chervil - something I didn't notice before ordering. Had I seen that, I would have ordered a different mix from another company. TL;DR Smaller than expected and minus Chervil"
"After reading all the positive raves about these products, I decided to give them a try. Having fresh lemons and limes isn't always possible and these are excellent substitutes. I like them so much that I'll need to invest in the large shaker size for home use and save the packets for carrying in my purse. I've added these to water and various teas (both hot and cold) and for cooking. I really like the lemon sprinkled on fish. I haven't tried the grapefruit but I plan to buy some soon. I don't seem to tolerate acesulfame potassium and sucralose very well, so I've stayed away from the True Lemonade drinks.<br />The taste of the lemon, lime, and the orange are very subtle to whatever you add them to, they truly enhance everything. They don't overpower the taste like some flavorings do.<br /><br />What I found surprising is that one of the product claims on their website is that these are sugar free, yet ""cane juice"" is listed last in the ingredients on each packet. I guess that's what they mean by ""no artificial sweetners"". TL;DR YUM!!!"
"Great for sweetening coffee and oatmeal. I have found many amazing things to do with muscovado sugar and I will never go back to artificial sweeteners again!!<br /><br />Another one I constantly use is the brand called EL MAESTRO and I usually buy it on ebay. It has a pure, strong molasses taste much that I absolutely love. I believe its imported from the Philippines where they specialize in that. Don't get me wrong, both El Maestro and India Tree are amazing products!!<br /><br />But yeah, you can't compare muscovado sugar to any other sugars out there. Perfect with any recipe, especially coffee and tea... and marinating meats! TL;DR Muscovado All The Way"
"The coffee package leeks out all over machine wial brewing.Not a good manufacturing job.the coffee is good, what ever gets into your cup. TL;DR k-cup package"
"The title of my review really says it all. These are delicious. I blended them with some white, green, pink, and szechuan peppercorns in my grinder for more of a zesty, peppery taste. All the other peppercorns I purchased came from the same company. I'm still enjoying them, I'm sure you will too!<br /><br />Good Luck! TL;DR Just Nothing Better Than Fresh Cracked Pepper!"
"At .33 cents a box, what a deal.  I love sharing mine with others and watching their eyes as they open the box.  Lots of memories are brought back.  Frito Lay is doing a great job with the quality. TL;DR Take these out to the ball game"
"I like this product a lot during the cool winter months.  Something about a warm breakfast just makes the whole day better, and this is a quick and easy way to get one.  I like to make mine with milk instead of water, and my girlfriend adds extra brown sugar to hers.<br /><br />However, it is not as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5TRK"">McCANN'S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, but the price for Quaker is usually about a third less and the Quaker is easier to find at the grocery store. TL;DR Very good on a cold morning..."
"Being from Europe, I have used this sauce for years and years. I have not found anything that comes even close to its delicious taste. In Europe you can buy several brands that are alike but I like the Hela brand the best and I always have a bottle in my fridge. I prefer the smaller size bottle (400ml) because it fits better in my fridge door.<br /><br />It says ketchup on the bottle but it nothing like ketchup or the spicy ketchups you can find at the regular shops. You just have to try it for yourself to decide whether you like it or not.<br /><br />The sauce goes well on fried or grilled potatoes but it is also very nice on your bratz or other grilled meats & poultry. Mix it up with some mayonaise and you will get mayonaise with a kick.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of would be the price. The price + shipping would be 7 times more than a bottle bought back home. TL;DR Tastes delicious!"
"Why pay $1.37 for a pouch from Walmart when you can pay a grand total of $10.05 (including shipping) from this store?!? I have so much money that I don't know what else to do with it. Sometimes I just dump gasoline all over the ground when I'm filling up my car because I can't spend my money fast enough! It's growing off trees! It's practically contagious, I have to spend it as quickly as I can before it burns a hole in my picket.  Thank you, thank you for finally selling a product that is so over-priced that I can't resist buying it! TL;DR Who doesn't love getting ripped off?"
"really please with my purchase. It was on sale here when I bought it. Actually bunch of candies were on sale that time and I bought whole bunch of it. currently I tired three kinda from three different manufactures, and I have say that this one is the best among the three. I still have one more to try.<br />I absolutely loved these dark chocolate orange balls. they are best TL;DR love these dark chocolate orange ball"
"My mother-in-law sent me 2 cans of thin cut last year. I added fresh kumquats thinly cut, cooked for 5 minutes, added Harley's and then followed the rest of instructions provided. It was a big hit. My friends loved it and asked for the recipe. Fresh kumquats enhanced the flavor and fragrance.<br /><br />My friends couldn't believe it took only 30 minutes to make. They thought I spent hours boiling and stirring the syrup.<br /><br />Home made orange marmalade is one of the gifts to my friends in this Holiday and it will be every year.  Thanks to Harley's..... TL;DR One of the best Christmas gifts to friends"
"okay first off this thing is like 7 pounds full of deliciousness. and i would recomend not eating the whole thing in one day.... it has 6,000 calories. haha TL;DR yum"
Bought this to give me a little extra boost during the Tough Mudder New England 2012. Worked as good as I expected. Gave me the continued energy for the 10 mile obstacle course without the jittery feeling of energy drinks. TL;DR Energy boost
This is by far our son's favorite flavor! They dissolve nice and are the perfect first finger food! They taste great and smell good too. TL;DR love!
NICE SAMPLE OF VARIOUS COFFEES.  I FOUND I LIKED MOST OF THEM.  IT IS  A GOOD WAY TO FIND YOUR PERFECT FLAVOR. YOU GET ABOUT TWO OF EACH FLAVOR.  THEY SHOULD HAVE INCLUDED A COUPLE OF JAMAICA ME CRAZY. TL;DR VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE
"I received a Soft Baked oatmeal cookie in my VoxBox and was very excited to try it. I am always skeptical about the cookies that are advertised as ""soft"". This one truly is. I tried to save some for my husband but it didn't sit there for long. I wish my oatmeal cookies turned out like this! TL;DR Love these!"
"I can not taste any flavoring in these, I put many drops into the water, increasing by increments and all it did was make the water sweet, there is no flavor here. I don't understand how others have tasted any flavoring at all because I sure didn't, I so wanted something all natural that would taste good but this is just drinking sugar water so now I have to find something to add some flavor to the water. These work well with tea, since there is no real flavor here you taste the tea and it makes it sweet enough. TL;DR What flavor?"
"I ordered one of these for a gift to be delivered to a client in USA, so it is a great service for me to use, and the recipient said it was great and seemed to really love it, so I think this is one I will give again in the future!<br /><br />Helene Malmsio TL;DR Ordered for a Client's Christmas Gift"
"This is a surprising good quality tea from the Canadian company, Higgins and Burke. In years past, I have had English breakfast tea that has been bitter and overly acidic. This English Breakfast is smooth, without any bitter after taste.<br /><br />It has a pleasant, almost floral aroma as well.<br /><br />It can also be served chilled, with good taste, as well.<br /><br />This tea is recommended highly for general home use. TL;DR good quality, smooth tea, quite enjoyable"
"This Lawry's Tenderizing Beef Marinade is the best seasoning for beef we have found over many years. It works very quickly - typically 15 minutes as recommended. Do not over do with more time.<br /><br />We especially love it with the London Broil or Round cuts of beef.  Because of this particular seasoning/tenderizer ""London Broil"" beef has become our most favorite cut of beef to season and grill. TL;DR Lawry's Tenderizing Beef Marinade"
My little Bichon is very spoiled and very hard to please when it comes to treats but loves the Duck Breast Tenders. In fact I order 6 bags at once because he eats so many. He knows where they are kept and stands in front of the door until I give him the treats. I highly recommend. TL;DR Best Dog Treats Ever
"We used to purchase Glenny's Soy Crisps from Walgreens, but they no longer carry the product in the Walgreen stores where we shop. I was so excited to find these on Amazon! These are better (crunchier) than baked chips and are packed with protein. The product comes in several flavors. My top favorites are BBQ and lightly salted. The lightly salted is probably the healthiest because the sodium is lower, but it's enough salt to still taste good. One bag is 3 points on Weight Watchers Point Plus program. TL;DR Delicious and healthy snack!"
"The item arrived very quickly as described and it was fresh, with aa expiration date that was a year out. TL;DR Fast and fresh"
"Very tasty treat for when we are on the go! Love the fact that it's instant protein in a pre-packaged, quick to grab serving size. I prefer these when they are slightly chilled but the kids seem to like even when they are at room temperature. TL;DR Tasty Treat"
"These arrived securely packaged, not even a chip on one lollipop.  They also tasted really good and looked very pretty at my sister's baby shower.  I would buy these again for myself and suggest to future buyers! TL;DR Great Product!"
"As is unfortunately the case more often than not, if a food tastes really yummy then it's probably not very good for you. These crackers have a nice, creamy taste to them and they pack 7 grams of fat per serving. Yes, that is fewer grams than potato chips, but for a cracker I think that's pretty high in fat content. The taste, however, is very good and these would make a good snack if consumed in moderation. One concern for me was the state of the crackers I received. I tasted these as part of the Vine program and the box I received was very smashed up and the crackers were partially obliterated. If I were buying these crackers, I would have been upset about their smashed-up condition. Perhaps it would not be a good idea to buy these in bulk until you can verify that shipping of these crackers won't damage the product. TL;DR Quite tasty but high in fat content"
"I place order the day before yesterday. My sister receive it today (4/27/2011). It takes 3 days, pretty good. I asked her for feedback, she said: NAH. not good, look like low class of flowers. Did you order the lowered price ever?  But I asked her to send me the picture. After I see the pictures, it changes my mind. I think not bad. Its kinda nice thow. TL;DR My sister Receive the order today(4/27/2011)"
i used to drink the dieters green often but i read that the senna in it is not good to consume that frequently so i reduced my intake. the dieters green made my tummy hurt just a little when i started to drink it but later it didn't bother me so much.<br /><br />i actually ordered this dieter's green but the seller gave me the super slimming one instead. i was pretty bummed at first but figured i'd give it a try. it ended up being a blessing in disguise. the slimming one is sort of the same as the dieter's green but it didn't really make my tummy hurt like the dieters green so i really love it. TL;DR sent me the wrong one but it's still good
"This is the best sauce I have ever tasted on anything!!! I eat some form of chicken every day, and this sauce is either on or beside my plate. TL;DR Stop Your Search Here!"
"This soup didn't have many reviews, but I got it figuring, how can you screw up vegetable soup?<br /><br />I opened the can and could actually see vegetables on the top.  This isn't like other soups where 3/4s of the can is filled with broth.  The broth itself was a nice deep red color.  The soup was delicious and filling.  Very pleased and would order again. TL;DR Very impressed"
"I really like having a different flavor of the tea to go with the original tea. This tea makes me feel lighter and healthier while the original helps to lose weight. Plus, drinking the tea every day reminds me what I'm working towards! TL;DR Great Cleanser Tea"
"I have been using SunButter for some years now as a Peanut Butter alternative. Not due to any allergies, but peanuts contain high levels of L-Arginine, an amino acid that is known to build muscle mass but may also inhibit the immune system (or so I have read). Sunbutter is very tasty, especially so if you like sunflower seeds. I like it better than peanut butter, and the fat composition is supposed to be healthier for you, so why wouldn't you try it ? I find that the ""Natural Sunbutter"" is tastier and smoother than the ""Creamy"" variety, but both are very good. Yes, more expensive and less common than peanut butter..... but I think anyone would enjoy it. TL;DR Sun Butter"
I've been using Mother's Milk Tea since the birth of our son 14 month ago...and it a wonderful product! I include a box in all my newborn gift baskets! Highly recommended! TL;DR Great!
Delicious. Perfect for fall. A little on the expensive side but so worth it. I added pumpkin sugar free syrup and whip cream. TL;DR YUM
"I used this rub for the first time about 3 weeks ago.  I saw it in the store and decided to try it since I LOVE BBQ and trying new spices.  I used it on a tri-tip that I was planning on smoking later in the evening.  I rubbed the tri-tip down with garlic olive oil and gave it a light-medium coating of this rub, threwe it in a gladlock bag, and let it marinate in the fridge for about 3 hours.  I got my Big Steel Keg up to about 300 degrees and threw 4 chunks of hickory wood on the lump.  Put the tri-tip on over direct heat this time because I like my to have a little bit of the char flavor vs just plain indirect smoking(for this meat anyways).  I left it on for about 1.5 hours or so(don't remember the exact time because I do not BBQ by time but I would guess around this time).  I took it off and let it rest for about 10 minutes.  I have to say this was by far the best tri-tip I have ever made/had.  This rub gets two thumbs up from me.  I just ordered the 10pk from Amazon with free prime shipping.  I just noticed that they have a Memphis flavor ""slow and low"" rub as well that I will try next time. TL;DR Awesome rub.."
Fresh and yummy.  My son-in-law loves Almond Roca and I'll it buy again and again for other family and friends as well!! TL;DR Almond Roca Candy
This tea has a wonderful soothing flavor and aroma that is good any time of day.  The Stevia gives it just the right amount of sweetness and the other ingredients blend well.  Very nice. TL;DR A very nice cup of tea
"This is the most impressive, right down to the soul, just almost like your Mama used to make! Makes you want to eat more! The Richness of the Maple is there but yet is not overwhelming and likewise the sweetness of that Brown Sugar compliments it fully; it just cannot be beat! Had given this to my grandchildren who HATES oatmeal, without even saying what it was - and they wanted MORE not even knowing what it was. This is all good for you, with genuine Oats, added additional dietry needs with just a touch of sweetness and all the home-goodness makes it all irresitable! TL;DR That Awesome Homemade Just Almost Like Your Mama Makes!"
"We used our bug off, 60 x 80, all last spring and summer and intend to begin using it again this year.  It fits our double doors very well both side to side and height.  It is easy to go in and out and the snap closure works instantly.  Our dogs easily learned to go in and out so, if you need to keep a dog inside this wouldn't work for you (unless your dog is very well trained and can learn that he is not allowed to go through the screen).  The screen opens up our outdoors to us with plenty of filtered light and breeze.  would recommend it to anyone. TL;DR Love this instant screen"
"what's not to like??????? pleasingly great bold taste.....and price is quite lower than in the stores, even Wal-mart!!!....will definitely purchase again! TL;DR coffee"
"my nutritionist recommended the kind bar as afternoon snack. I LOVE the bar, it is a treat for me and have lost 14 pounds in 5 months.  The kind bar in the afternoon is my treat that has helped with curbing my craving, keeps me full and not over eat at dinner time.  And the best of it all ""it is good for you.""<br />I love this flavor and my other favorites are the Dark Chocolate cherry cashew and nuts with pistachio. TL;DR helps with weight loss"
"My wife & I enjoy coffee with a nice bold taste without the bitter after taste. This coffee is the best we tasted since we've purchased the Keurig Coffee maker, until Emeril's, all other brands have tasted watery and have been tempted to return the coffee maker. A must try!!! TL;DR Best Keurig Coffee"
"While I haven't found a decaff I'd serve with challah, this one I'd give to the rebbe. TL;DR A decaff, but good"
"Had been looking for this item for a long time, but was a little worried by the statement in some of the reviews that the handle design causes a problem.  Since the handle is flat, it is difficult to pick up the server and then open the lid with one hand.  The secret is to place the thumb on the lid tab with the fingers under the handle, and then open the lid by pressing the thumb down before, or at the same time as, you lift the server.  This is very stable and you can then carry and use the server easily. TL;DR Works and Looks Great"
"I have been buying this product for at least 8 years. The butter flavor is true, the popped -corn is fluffy, & just the right amount of salt+ the fact that it is 94 fat free.The 2.9 oz. bag is about 225 calories. This is the only brand I will buy and I have tried many, many brands. TL;DR Popcorn, Popcorn & more Popcorn"
"About four years ago, I discovered that my (then 6 mo. old) West Highland Terrier had allergies to chicken and chicken by-products. I tried Nutro and Blue Buffalo over a course of six months, slowly switching in between to lessen any digestive issues.  However, neither brand seemed to make a major difference.  After reading an online review of Merrick, I switched him to their Wilderness Blend and after about of month I noticed a drastic difference in his health and appearance.  He no longer had stomach issues, and his coat went from a dull white-with-yellowish tinge to a beautiful shiny white color.  Four years later, he still loves this food, and he remains free of the typical digestive and coat issues that Westies are known for having.  I wholeheartedly recommend the dry and canned Merrick non-chicken based products (Wilderness blend, Turducken, Brats-N-Tots, etc.) to anyone with a dog that has food allergies! TL;DR Superior dog food for allergies"
"Ketchup isn't something I had given much thought to, in the past.  The sad truth is, we had run out of ketchup in the dead of winter and I could get it from Amazon faster than I was going to get to the store.  I read the great reviews and decided to give this one a try.<br /><br />Not only do we LOVE this ketchup, but we gave bottles to family members and they now LOVE it also.  ""Let us know if you need us to take any more of that ketchup off your hands!"" they say.  :)<br /><br />I love the taste, the texture, and I love that I can give it to my kids and actually feel pretty good about them dipping everything in it.  Highly recommend!<br /><br />The only drawback, if you are a stickler about expiration dates, is that we did not use an entire case before it expired (part of the reason we shared with family).  I ordered my case in February, and it expired December of that year. TL;DR Entire family LOVES this ketchup"
"I learned about these muffins while visiting Costa Rica where they are sold at a local supermarket. Because they are not sold in New Jersey where I reside, I searched for them on the Internet. To my surprise I was able to buy a case and have them shipped to my home. My entire family loves them.  They have a special flavor unlike the normal English Muffins sold in NJ. They are pre-sliced so that you always have a perfect muffin to toast.  Add some imported butter and they are so deliscious.  I can't every go back to the Thomas English Muffins. TL;DR Bay's English Muffins are fantastic!"
"I have used this product multiple times.  In fact, I purchased four tubs of the gold and silver luster dust (2 each) five years ago and I am JUST NOW running out!  I use this stuff to gild all sorts of things for Renaissance themed banquets - including gilding an entire roast duck and then, using vodka, painting filigree designs onto it!  The clients thought it was prop food it looked so beautiful.  I can't recommend this stuff enough! TL;DR The Inexpensive Alternative to Gold Leaf!"
"A grain-free good for her treat that my yorkie loves? I am sold. We're on about our 20th. bag. By the way she loves all the flavors. TL;DR My yorkie loves, so I love!"
My son loves this and I feel better giving him whole wheat pasta than the traditional one. TL;DR Pretty good and it's whole wheat.
"I decided to try ""The Switch"" orange tangerine because it was promoted as a drink that is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all-natural and it happens to be carbonated.<br /><br />The taste is like drinking orange juice at first with carbonation and I have to be truthful, at first I wondered if it was an alcoholic beverage at first.<br /><br />But after tasting it, you do taste the combination of the orange tangerine and the carbonation.<br /><br />The drink contains no sugar or corn syrup and no preservatives.<br /><br />Overall, a tasty carbonated beverage with only 140 calories and no fat.  15mg of sodium and 36g of carbs.<br /><br />If you are interested in the beverage that combines the taste of juice and carbonation, give ""Switch"" a try! TL;DR A combination of juice and carbonation, 100% juice, no sugar, no artificial flavors"
I was really upset when my local store quit carrying this tea. I found another place to buy it but it cost twice as much. When I found it on Amazon I was thrilled because it cost me less than my local store. Boy did they do me a favor by stopping to carry it! TL;DR Best price for terrific tea!!!
"I read all the reviews of this product and couldn't wait to use it. I took it for over a week when my baby started to get extremely fussy. The doctor determined she had colic, changed my diet, added special formula - still was not producing enough breast milk, and took me off all vitamins. After a week, she was becoming our happy baby again. I started taking this product again and within three days she started screaming again. I immediately stopped taking this and within a few days she was back to normal. For some reason this product bothered her stomach. I did not read anything about this in any of the reviews and want to let people know this could happen to them as well. TL;DR Didn't work for me"
"This is a great start for the morning breakfast, afternoon energy boost, and bedtime warm snack.  I found this in Florida and tried it.  Now that this SNOWBIRD is back north I couldn't find it in any store here.  It is quick and easy to make in the microwave and I usually make enough to have some in the frig for a quick warm up. TL;DR Can't believe this is not in every store in America."
"Initially my cats loved all three flavors of this Fancy Feast product. Then I got a box that had one badly deformed and bulging can; obviously bacteria were growing in it. I didn't even open it - just threw it away.<br /><br />I called the company to inform them. They asked for the production number from the can and sent me coupons for 4 free cans. Wonderful, as far as it goes, but that entire batch must have been bad because the cats would not touch any of the chicken-flavored cans remaining in the box. So I'm out eight cans, not just the four replaced.<br /><br />These things happen, but I can't afford to throw away money like that, so if it happens again, I will not be buying Fancy Feast. In the meantime, the cats love the beef first, and turkey comes in a close second. TL;DR One Spoiled Can Spoils the Batch"
"I love this product! BUT the downside is that I was overcharged. When I saw that the cost of this product was $10.00 I assumed that it meant $10.00 for a case. When I received only one can, I was stunned to say the least. A few days ago I happened upon this product at a grocery store. The 8.1 oz was $1.29. I am hereby requesting my change back!!!!!!  Rumford is one of the best baking powders presently on the market!!!  I like the fact that it's aluminum free.  Hence, I will be purchasing this product from the grocery store. TL;DR Stunned"
"This is a great snack for my little guy. It's wonderful nutrition with a yummy taste, very good combination. Makes a great snack. TL;DR Great nutrition and great taste"
"As a frequent Traveler to the West Coast, I have found myself in accommodations where there just wasn't a nearby StarBucks location, and I don't have the taste for regular coffee, since there is just too much Inconsistency and reliability of both coffeemakers and coffee/espresso grinds.<br />Plus, I have been Spoiled Rotten by my purchase of the Bosch Tassimo Coffee/espresso maker earlier this year, that currently, I am still working thru my StarBuck's enormous inventory and supply of their espresso's, and then, it's not like I can just take my Tassimo with me on my trips either!<br />I purchased the Hand-powered espresso machine, called the HandPresso Wild - Black model, mainly because it uses the StarBucks Espresso Pods.<br />I will be writing a separate review on the ""HandPresso"" unit, which I have learn to love!<br /><br />In short, here's the main highlights for the 'StarBucks Espresso Pods' - I Highly Recommend them!<br /><br />* Starbucks Espresso Roast Pods, are each in their own Foil-sealed package, EZ to tear open, with 12-pods in each box, has a dense, caramel-like sweetness and smooth, satisfying finish. I usually take 2 boxes on my 2 to 3 -week trips, and always have some left over.<br /><br />* Price point of only $4.95 is Excellent! That's only 41 cents per shot, AND, it's Human-powered! How Cool is that!<br /><br />* Starbucks coffee pods, filled with fresh-roasted, ground and tamped Starbucks Espresso Roast, so there's no measuring, no grinding, no mess.<br /><br />* The coffee pods can be used with most home espresso machines (must accept E.S.E. - Easy Serving Espresso - pods.)<br /><br />* With a good `Routine', you can make an Expresso in 5-minutes or less!<br /><br />Here is my Recommended AM Espresso Routine:<br /><br />1. Be sure to clean the unit the night before, then leave my Favorite StarBucks Coffee Cup + the  `HandPresso' open in 2 parts + 1 or 2 Espresso Pod(s) + Creamer, and/or Sweetener, if applicable, out on the kitchen counter.<br />2. First thing in the AM, before shaving, I  place a 1 or 2-quart Tea Kettle with or without a Whistle is fine on the stove. Check out the Pedrini model listed here on Amazon, it's Simple and it Works!<br />Use about a quart of fresh or filtered water and bring to a Boil.<br />3. As soon as I return to the kitchen, I hand-pump the HandPresso to the maximum of 16 (top of Green bar), and once you get the hang of it, this only takes 1 to 2 minutes, and is Great Exercise, BTW!<br />TIP - the Handle IS the `hand-pump', and it only takes a Quarter Turn Counter-clockwise to ""Unlock"", and let the Pumping begin! When done, you may turn it Clock-wise to Re-lock it, but is not necessary.<br />4. I then open the Espresso Pod, place it nearby, AND, place my Powered or Liquid Creamer (&/or Sweetener), in the cup, and pour an ounce or two of Hot H2O, into it to ""prep it"".<br />5. Then, I pour the Hot, boiling water into the Glass Well opening, on the HandPresso, to at or near the top, I place the  Pod in it, then place the Lid, Pushing down slightly (look for the White line markings), then Turn it Clock-wise and Locking it in place. Important - Don't forget to Push & Place the Actuator Button, into the ""On"" position.<br />6. I Flip the HandPresso over and directly over my cup, and Press Down on the Button. Watch the Magic Happen! This only takes about 3 or 4 minutes, and at the end you will start to see BOTH the Pressure Needle move to the 0 position, AND there will also be some creamy froth and bubbling from the Pod.<br />7. Stir and Enjoy! Remember, once you have established your `ROUTINE Steps', the whole procedure becomes much Faster, especially when Traveling, Camping or on any Expeditions.<br /><br />Caveats - Use less H2O if you want a Stronger Shot, Use more Creamer to dilute it, thus giving you a fuller cup of coffee/espresso. If you are just going to use a Sweetener, and NO Creamer, I highly using the Organic, Low Glycemic Sweetener, made from Blue Agave Nectar, by Wholesome Sweeteners. TL;DR StarBucks Shot in the AM!"
"This cereal is so flippin' good. Its legendary status comes from its ability to stay crunchy in milk and the mix of nutmeg, cinnamon and coconut flavors. My sources tell me it's pretty healthy too. TL;DR Cracklin' O"
"This tastes like bacon the same way a lot of other stuff is said to ""taste like chicken"" even though you can plainly tell it isn't while you're eating it. TL;DR think of all the times you've heard ""tastes like chicken"""
"Yes it is syrup, but is is also sugar-free. I thought it tasted quite good for a sugar-free product and the bottle reminds me of the one at IHOP. TL;DR Yes, Sugar Free..."
"This Royal Canine yorkie food is loved by my pet. My dog tends to be finicky, and eats this brand with the least amount of coaxing. Have tried other brands and he has left the food uneaten, so this works best for him. TL;DR GOOD YORKIE FOOD"
"Excellent pineapple.  Small pieces that are the right size.  The pieces are thin, soft and chewy. No added sugar.  Product of Costa Rica, hopefully they follow strick organic practices.  Very easy to eat the whole bag within a day or two.  Will be buying again.  I have found that Made in Nature brand to sell excellent tasty items. TL;DR Pineapple sweet and delicous"
"This Peanut Sauce is incredible. It has a little bite, though, so you can add peanut butter to mellow it out if you're sensitive to heat. I love it best with chicken-lettuce wraps. TL;DR best!"
"This juice is rich, tasty with full-bodied taste.  I use it to make fruit juice shakes and in my protein shakes.  The reason why I ordered the juice is because I read that cherry juice is great for inflammation.  Prior, to drinking it I suffered from stiffiness and tenderness in my tendons and knees.  It has alleviated the stiffness and my flexibility is improving tremendously. TL;DR Refreshing, the Best!"
"I don't know whether it was the high fat content spurring on feline acne (food literally leaves a grease stain on her nose after eating it) or just an allergic reaction, but this food gave my kitten some pretty bad swelling, redness, and slight hair loss around the lips. I was forced to switch brands after a move recently and noticed the sores went away, finally found this brand again after a few weeks, and the sores promptly returned. Now I have her back on another brand, and within a week of switching the sores went away again. TL;DR Caused allergic reaction and sores around kitten's lips"
"These treats got an good reaction from the 9yr old Australian Cattle Dog I gave them to. She seemed very into the way they smelled as she immediately came running as soon as she smelled them, and she eagerly gobbled them up when offered as a reward for training. She however wasn't as tempted by them as some things as she was not as eager to come to them as some other treats when we needed to distract her from chewing on something she shouldn't have been chewing on. Whether this was because they did not taste as good to her or she just wasn't used to them I don't know, and she is pleading the 5th.<br /><br />I don't usually feed her homemade treats or anything so I wasn't too concerned with the ingredients list (as some other reviewers have mentioned), as it seemed to be better than most store bought treats, but the spices seemed weird to me, and I don't know if that was a drawback for my dog. Overall though, I would say they are pretty good, and would be good to use for training (The smell sure gets their attention!). TL;DR Interesting"
I am eating these cookies as I am writing this review and OMG. I love coconut flavored cookies and these are really good. I usually buy Ranger cookies from the bakery for church but I might replace buying those for these cookies. I bought these from a neighborhood Kroger which was reasonable pricing. They seem overpriced by this seller though. TL;DR YUMMY
"I bought this locally because the price was so very right, and finally baked it because my wheat-eating boyfriend was threatening to make grilled cheese sandwiches in my kitchen to get his bread fix.  *shudder*  I love the guy, but who wants wheat in their gluten-free kitchen?<br /><br />This did the trick, and I really enjoyed it.  The ingredients are very simple, and I suspect a large range of food allergies and special diets would tolerate it as a result.  My box says: corn flour, corn meal, sugar, tapioca starch, baking powder, xanthan gum, flake salt, and baking soda, but as always, make sure to check YOUR box before eating anything.<br /><br />The texture, flavor, and color all came out well.  I *mostly* followed the instructions, but used soy milk for milk, and I added the dry mix to the wet liquid mix with a mixer instead of pouring the wet ingredients into the dry mix and folding everything in with a spoon as instructed.  It's faster, and I don't believe the quality suffered any as a result.<br /><br />If you're vegan or cannot tolerate egg, you'll have to use a substitute for the 2 eggs required.  This mix also requires 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup ""milk"" (see above for substitution).  It dirties 2 dishes and makes a dozen corn bread muffins or a typical 8x8 pan, for 12-ish servings.  Mine came out perfectly even though my gas oven insists upon being up to 100 degrees over the temperature I set it for.<br /><br />My only complaint is nutrition.  The nutrition info shows that one serving is 100 calories dry, but no one eats cornbread mix dry!  There's no nutrition info for the completed corn bread, so you'll have to do your own math if you're watching your calories.<br /><br />I'll have to stock up on this since it's on sale locally.  I hope you enjoy yours, too! TL;DR This is good!"
"Cafix IS the coffee substitute that tastes most like coffee, and this pack of 6 from Amazon is the best deal you'll find. But, I first bought Cafix packaged in a glass jar and having a granular consistency. LOVED it! This Cafix is packaged in canisters and is a powder. It tastes different. Not bad. Just different. To me it has a very nutty taste. I like the glass jar Cafix better, but I can also drink the canister kind. Some people, however, might not like the nuttier taste. Just FYI. TL;DR Great value! Different taste."
"I happened to recently become aware of the health benefits of Organic Olive Oil and went on a quest to find high end product that had all the right formula for health, and the taste. I never new olive oil could be like this. I could almost drink this stuff. I wont be without it. I highly recommend Vida Oliva Oil. TL;DR Simply The Best Olive Oil I Ever Tasted"
"It's a good thing I got the packets, because I would eat this stuff by the cupful if I'd gotten a jar of it.<br /><br />Very tasty. Smells wonderful. The maple taste is slight. TL;DR Yum!"
My cat eats these and that makes us both happy. Of course the fish probably don't agree so my vegetarian side has issues. TL;DR my cat loves it
"My daughter is an ice cream lover. So, decided to make ice creams for her birthday party. We have made sherbets many times, but never done ice cream before. Purchased this mix and made ice creams with all five flavors. The whole experience of ice cream making with my daughter was hilarious. She really enjoyed making ice cream and we had ""Delight"" time while ice creams were brewing in the ice cream maker. The taste was rich and flavorful. The texture was softly dense. Among the five flavors, Mocha Coffee was the best treat to my taste buds and my daughter loved Belgium Chocolate the most. We prepared a variety of toppings- freshly sliced strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, some nuts, chocolate & Oreo chips and sprinkles for the home-made ice creams on the party day. Our topping collection was better than local Froyo store.^^ The party was a big success!! Especially, kids loved the ice creams with the toppings. This is our new dessert for my daughter's B-day & summer party from now on.<br /><br />Pros: All Natural or Organic, Cute Packaging Design, Easy to Prepare, Premium quality, Various flavors,<br />Cons: Strawberry has sour taste a bit stronger than other company's strawberry product, but more sugar made the taste more sweet than sour. TL;DR Made My Daughter's Birthday Fantastic!"
"I catered a grand-scale event using these nonpareil capers as the star ingredient. Everything from soups to sushi, seafood, pasta dishes to exotic salads and appetizers. These were excellent capers and I only wish I knew their exact origin?<br /><br />These were extra salty in their brine so we opted to give them a few rinses before using them in our dishes for our guests.<br /><br />Top notch. TL;DR A huge hit!"
"Great snack and good on salads.  It's dried peas, what else can I say? TL;DR Really like"
"Being able to enjoy delicious dried beans in 45 minutes is a real plus in my book.  In the past, cooking beans meant hours of soaking and boiling which meant planning ahead and watching the pot so the water didn't cook out. Canned beans are not an option here.  Convenience is only part of these beans' charm, the taste is wonderful enough to enjoy alone or in any dishes calling for pinto, kidney or navy beans. TL;DR Where no bean has gone before..."
"Full 1 LB. Strong, strong stuff. All 16 cats completely stoned. Love it!. Will be making tea with it tonight. TL;DR Best Catnip on Amazon"
"Back to Nature Chocolate Delight Granola is a combination of very dark chocolate and crunchy granola.  At 220 calories per one-half cup, it cannot be considered low-calorie.  It has a saturated fat content of 2g, 5mg sodium,13g sugar, and dietary fiber of 4g. I find that storing this product in the refrigerator keeps the chocolate at just the right consistency.  This is an extremely good-tasting combination and makes for a great snack.  The dark chocolate has just the right sweetness.  Others have remarked about the granola being crumbly and not very many clusters.  However, it is granola, and granola is quite crumbly.  Immediately upon opening and tasting Chocolate Delight Granola, I instantly fell in love with the crunch and flavor mix.  If you love dark chocolate, this item is for you.  The granola mixed in gives it a wonderful touch. Highly recommend it as a snack.  Very good! TL;DR Delicious combination!"
"My lovely wife and I enjoy hot sauces.  We also love garlic.  I mean, we LOVE GARLIC!  It's really surprising how most hot sauces do not have garlic, or have only a hint of garlic.  This sauce is hot, but not too hot.  It's garlicy .. but you can NEVER have too much garlic!  Simply put, this stuff is great.  It's versatile enough for anything.  This is the sauce we order and reorder. TL;DR Got Garlic?  You betcha!"
"The butter toffee flavor coffee is delicious without the artificial flavor taste so many coffees like this have.  It is a mild roast, so it's not for someone looking for a robust cup of coffee.  This is my go-to afternoon cup of coffee flavor. TL;DR My Favorite Flavored Gloria Jean Coffee!"
"I have to give it 1 star because they wont allow for any less... this ranch dressing is also waaaaaayyy too sweet, the chemical taste of the Splenda overtakes the taste of the actual product itself...I could never understand why they have to add soo much artificial sweetener to something such as a salad dressing, this is one of the five Walden's Calorie Free product I have tried and been VERY disappointed with... I was already taking my chances knowing it was sweetened with Splenda instead of Stevia but for God's sake why make it soo unpalatable?!  there are soo many alternatives out there and why kill it with soo much sweeterner?  My other reviews for these products may be around the same... but darn... I best just make my own dressing, might not be 100% calorie free but at least it will be consumable.  Why does RANCH need sugar?! WTF?  I have made ranch from scratch and never once did I add any sugar to it!  Also there is a dry chemical flavor that comes with this...  I am sooo lucky my healthfood store has a nice return policy because after tasting all these dressing products I could NOT use them and felt jipped because these aren't that cheap.. TL;DR Absolutely DISGUSTING! TOO SWEET!!"
"Although they do not taste good, they are a healthy, low cal snack.  When you add light cream cheese or Laughing Cow cheese and a slice of lean meat, the taste improves.  Then you have a great snack for less than 100 calories that will keep you satisfied throughout the afternoon. TL;DR GG Bran Crispbread"
"I didn't think the boxes were as small as they are, but they pack a considerable volume.<br /><br />This works great to keep on the table to sprinkle on your cereal, add to tea or water.<br /><br />I would buy again if I got the same or lower price next time around. TL;DR Great price and small boxes"
"I have been enjoying OTC crackers for over 50 years beginning when my parents would take my brother and me to Wenger's Oyster House in Reading, PA, another institution from the Great Depression days.  If I didn't have OTC's I wouldn't eat an oyster stew.<br /><br />You have to know how to break them when putting them into your soup or stew.  I see some complaints that they are too big, but these complainers are culturally illiterate!  You must take two crackers in hand, and squeeze them together.  One will break. Grind it smaller, then get another whole one, and repeat.  I laughed at those who say OTC's are too big.  What did you do- put them in your soup whole? They'll float for a year and not get soggy.  You must break them as it states on the box or bag.  And don't try to break just one by hand.  You are not strong enough.<br /><br />OTC's are indeed an American institution- been around for since 1848, and they still look and taste the same.  I pity you wretches who put those despicable weenie hexagon-shaped atrocities in your soup.  Be a man!  Bust OTC's in your stew! TL;DR An American Institution"
Unlike other reviews I found this product to be just right. The lemon flavor was very evident without being overpowering and the chive was present in the background. Now if only they made lemon pepper. TL;DR just right
"Well, This was my first EVER bonsai tree, and I liked it. I was reading other reviews, and I red about bugs. This freeked  me out, but when I got mine , The first two days were good. I got a little aluminum pan to be my water catcher thing, and around the 3rd day, I noticed ants. So then I looked online for ways to get rid of them. I tried soaking the roots for 10 minuets (like 4 different times) I didnt buy anything, or look to hard around my house for anything, I just realized. the best thing to do was just cut the roots (since you need to anywyas for repotting). That got rid of them.<br />One thing that I wish i knew ahead of time was Pruning. They say give it one growing season before re-potting, But my pot was nothing but roots. It was overflowing with roots, hardly any soil. and I got it in the winter, So i cut the roots, Re-potted, right before spring, and Man did it do amazing.<br />The ant problem was gone, but then I noticed I had Aphids. Soo, I started researching that too. So what I ended up doing was just mixing some spices I had around my house. I found the most dryest-spiciest-most fine seasonings I had, mixed it with water, and sprayd the plant.<br />That got rid of them, and didnt harm the plant at all.<br /><br />I rate this a 4 out of 5 Because, It came to me in about 6 or so days, (from Cali to Ohio) which was fine with me, but the ammount of work I needed to put in.<br />Took to long figuring out how to get rid of the ants, and aphids.<br />They had ants and aphids in the first place. But Cant really blame them. Its a plant, no bigdeal, I cought them before they could really wreck the plant.<br />Just besure for when you prune the roots.<br /><br />I tried to get better soil, and re-cut the roots right before May 1st, and now its Dead, I think I cut tomany roots.<br />But the bug problem was long gone, so I know it wasnt that. I waterd it daily, It had sun. So my guess would be the root pruning.<br /><br />But hey, I learnd alot since then, Did even more research, So<br />I recomend this Tree to anyone, Just besure you check the roots, and look for Aphids (mine were white tiny bugs, died if you touched them because theyre so soft, and I just shook the tree, and some of them fell off. Thats how I knew I even had them)<br /><br />Pardon my spelling and or grammer. TL;DR Good start"
"Awesome taste, granola-like texture, and great for snacking. I love the bread, but when I'm craving a cereal snack, this is just right w some skim milk or protein shake mixed in; straight from the box is another viable option. TL;DR Ezekiel Living"
Great product. Quality and flavor are oustanding. It will improve any type of dish. Highly recommended. Will buy this product again. TL;DR Spanish Garden Smoked Spanish Paprika 2.65-ounce cans
"I've been a cooking and fine foods enthusiast for several decades.  This is just an outstanding spice blend for most any type of seafood, the best I've ever found.  You can use it alone (as in under the broiler, with some butter and lemon), in soups, stews, seafood-oriented pasta dishes, or in tandem with other sauces.  This morning, I sprinkled some onto spreadable chevre on a toasted bagel with smoked salmon.  Fantastic !  The only bad thing about this product is when you run out !  It also has no sodium, but great flavor, which really gives the lie to the supposed need for all the killer doses of salt you find in so many products nowadays.<br /><br />The thing that really bugs me is how hard it is to find this item on the shelves anywhere.  So many places have huge racks of Spice Hunter products -- of which there are a great many to choose from, at premium prices -- but somehow THIS one never seems to make the cut.  Some Whole Foods locations had it -- briefly -- years ago.  I've asked Bristol Farms to add it to their stock, but I think they are phasing out of Spice Hunter entirely.  The one place I could find it semi-reliably was Erewhon in L.A., and even then they were usually down to the last couple jars.  Oh well . . .  this just joins a considerable list of great products you can only find online.  I suppose the much more reasonable price is adequate compensation for that. TL;DR Simply the BEST general-purpose seafood seasoning"
"I wouldn't call myself a coffee snob, and probably not even a coffee connoisseur, but I do know good coffee.  I've tried a lot of different kinds over the years, and when a friend of mine went to CR and came back with a bag of this, I was hooked.  I've been ordering it for years now, and it's my daily drink.  Every now and then I run out, so I try something else as a gap-filler until my next order arrives, and I'm always disappointed.  This is the best! TL;DR Absolutely fantastic!"
"I had purchased these hummus chips, sesame garlic, at a health food store and loved the true flavor of garlic and sesame.  I purchased a whole case from amazon the next week.  They are not like the typical snack chip you find in the grocery store, the humbles brand is healthy yet has intense flavor, you can tell right away with the first taste that they don't have that heavy salty oily taste like some chips have. I will purchase these chips again. TL;DR humbles chips are flavorful"
"It is not what I thought it would be.  I expected more chocolatey, so I was disappointed.  Other Tassimo coffees are very good, so I won't let this keep me from ordering others.  I especially like the Kona blend. TL;DR I've Had Better"
"If you like Chai, this will be your new favorite!  So yummy!  Our only problem was that we kept running out! TL;DR Buy the larger box - You'll thank me later!"
These tacos are great. Highly recommend for all vegetarians. Better tnan the meat tacos you make or get out. TL;DR Great vegan tacos!!!
"I tried this food because reviews claim it is more natural and therefore more healthy for your dog, it also gives a satisfaction guarantee.  Well, the food made my dog sick! (caused puking, muscle spasms) So I clipped the proof of purchase and mailed in my receipt as the guarantee asked. I got a coupon in the mail for a small bag of food! For one, the coupon is for a smaller bag of food. Two, I requested a refund....why would I give the same food to my dog and make him sick? I called customer service and they said you can only get refunds from the retailer! Ok, now that you took my receipt how do I do that? The customer service for Evo was unhelpful and was not able to help my situation. Apparently it is not a true satisfaction guarantee. TL;DR Poor Customer Service/ Bad Food"
"Love this tea!  My family drinks Herbal tea mostly all day, iced or warm, and this chai is great!!!<br /><br />My kids love it and I love it!  I've shared with some friends, and THEY love it!<br /><br />I put it up against one of my friends homemade Chai! YUM!<br /><br />Great stuff! TL;DR Best Chai!"
"Nice , dark , Chinese restaurant flavored , tea. Smells , and tasts great ! TL;DR restaurant quality"
"If you're like me, then you LOVE peanut butter so much that you can't really keep it in the house.  The 'real' stuff is so full of fat and salt and hydrogenated oils that its yumminess comes at a pretty high cost.  PB2 is a great alternative.  It's not exactly the same taste as a commercial product, but it's close enough that when you put with the other things you would normally eat you will not notice much of a difference, and if you do, just imagine how much fat you're not eating!<br /><br />One of the great advantages of this product is that you can make it whatever consistency you want, just by altering the amount of water you add in the mixing process.  I find that makes it a very versatile product for cooking when I want to make a peanut sauce, or when I put it on apples and want it a bit thicker than the standard ratio delivers.<br /><br />Also, the fact that is has to be mixed up short circuits the spoon-to-mouth pattern that made it impossible for me to keep the 'real' stuff in the house.<br /><br />The only real down side is that because it's a powder there is no 'crunchy' version, but I suppose you could chop up peanuts and mix them in if you wanted to. TL;DR Great full-fat pb substitute"
"This was the best soymilk I have ever drank,and I drank like 4 different brands.If your going to buy soymilk this one is the one you have to get. TL;DR Superb"
"The popcorn itself is yummy, just be warned that we had trouble popping it using our air popper.  The kernels were too light and would blow out of the popper before they were popped.  It's great in the microwave or a pan, but maybe the larger white or yellow would be a better match for an air popper. TL;DR A Caveat"
I really enjoy the taste of this product. I definitely plan on keeping this in my carousel as an option to enjoy during this cold winter. TL;DR k Cup Cider Very Good!
"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much. Sugar free candies can be pretty gross, so I had my fingers crossed. turns out, they are really good! Fruity and a little minty, no artificial after-taste at all, and not sickeningly sweet like some artificially sweetened candies. I'll definitely be ordering them again. They're pricey, but worth it for that occasional treat. TL;DR Delicious candies"
"I personally love plain water, and normally would have no problem drinking it plain.  However, the added energy and vitamin C would sometimes be a handy timesaver for me.  I probably won't be purchasing this product for myself, because I hated the taste.  As another reviewer noted, it has a medicine type taste, not to mention a rather long lasting aftertaste.  It may just be an acquired taste, as I tend to dislike artificial sweetener type tastes, though many other people are not bothered by them.<br /><br />I tried with little success to vary the amount used, thinking perhaps a smaller squirt would be better.  However, it's tough to squirt from this bottle, and it tended to be a large serving each time.  I do have arthritis in my hands, and that may have affected my use of the bottle.<br /><br />I'll stick to my plain old water.  Seems like just another way to part the consumer with his dollar.  ` TL;DR Better Than Mio, But Not Very Tasty"
"Being a fan of both appletinis and Crystal Light, I wanted to give this a try.  It really does taste almost exactly like an appletini.  I'm half-tempted to add some vodka to this.  While it's not my favorite Crystal Light flavor (I like all the lemonade variations best), I'll definitely add this one to the ones I buy repeatedly. TL;DR yum"
"When first unwrapping the 11 oz. Package of Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique Supreme Ground Coffee, the aroma may bring about the anticipation of what to expect from this brand.  And after preparing two or more teaspoons, depending on one's preference, and hearing the coffee maker percolate and finally smelling the freshly made pot of coffee made and taking the first sip, one will experience Melitta as an alternative to other gourmet coffees.  With its mild and not as strong taste as a regular cup of Starbuck's, coffee drinkers familiar with Folgers' Gourmet Selections may find this brand as comparable.  Indeed, a coffee worth trying. TL;DR The aroma and taste is enough"
"I randomly got these on a Jet Blue flight (kettle flavour) and thought to myself whatever... When I bit into this chip I said ""you've got to be kidding me""... as soon as I landed I hooped in a cab and went on good ol amazon.com and ordered a variety box. I absolutly love the cheesy jalapeno flavour, spicy but not over bearing... I serve it at my friendly ""get-togethers"" but everyone wants a bag to go. of course I tell them they better go on amaie and order their own... (now i hide the box in my bedroom ;) TL;DR you've got to be kidding..."
"As with the other reviewers, I have used the Broiled Steak Seasoning for years and when I ran out, I noticed I couldn't find it anywhere.  Nothing compares to Broiled Steak Seasoning, so I turned to Amazon.  I ordered these massive bottles and gave one to my mother.  We made some Porterhouse steaks and it is exactly as I remember...mmmm.  Now I have to figure out how to keep such a big bottle of seasoning from getting old and stale before its all gone which will probably take years! TL;DR McCormick Steak Season"
"I found these cashews too salty and peppery for my taste. There is also a hint of onion flavor with some citric acid to give them a slightly sour taste. Some cashews were almost completely encrusted with coarse salt making them almost bitter in taste. I found it hard to have more than 2-3 cashews at one time. Combining a handful of these cashews with a cocktail is a sure way to get heartburn!<br /><br />The price is also on the higher side. I prefer the store branded lightly salted and far less oily tinned cashews you can get at any grocery store to these. TL;DR Too salty, a little too oily and overpriced!"
My favorite beverage! Can't live without it! I also agree the mix of flavor and tea is a perfect blend. TL;DR One of a kind flavor
"We have been using this coffe for more than a year and we love it.  However, it is expensive on a 'per serving' basis.  It is also hard to find.  The grocery is often sold out.  The best price and most reliable supplier we have found is Amazon.com. TL;DR Great coffee"
"Everything but the masa spreader can be bought much cheaper at a local store like Walmart.<br />I only bought it because I needed a steamer and wanted the spreader, instead of buying the ingredients myself I thought I'd just grab the package. I didn't like the peppers but everything else was fine.<br />The spread works good if you use it right.<br />Could use a recipe book. Hard to find a good one online.<br />A little advice, dry the corn husks well after you soak them, otherwise the masa wont stick, will mix water, and just be a pain. TL;DR Little value"
"I'm happy. Great price for the product I rely on, especially when I come home from work, the wife has been stressed by the baby, and I need that last little kick to help her out! I like the berry more than this grape tho. TL;DR 5Hour Energy-grape 2x12pk"
"I have tried various brands of Palak Paneer. Kitchens of India Palak Paneer tastes good. If you are health conscious like me, this one is not for you. This one seems to be soaked in too much oil. TL;DR Palak Paneer Too Greasy"
"I to brought at Sam Club for 4.98. You think a fuzzy navel is good use frozen fruit you dont need ice it thick but smooth, Just try it you  will love it. TL;DR Frozen  Fruit is Great"
"What's create about this pancake mix, besides the pancakes tasting great, is how easy it is to use.  The only thing you add is water, which makes it perfect for kids to make or to cart off on a backpacking trip.  The consistency of the cooked pancakes is just like the gluten filled type so it can be enjoyed by families with both the gluten sensitive and glutenous members. TL;DR Yummy Pancakes"
"I bought a Goldenvale Jumbo raisin medley at our local grocery store.<br />I normally don't get excited about raisins, but these were among the best I had ever tasted, both in their juiciness AND with the taste combination from the three different kinds of raisins. As I continued munching through half the bag, I couldn't help but think, ""with this kind of taste, who needs to be eating candy! This is as good as most candy I have had! TL;DR Great Product!"
"My 6 months son love to eat these baby food. Actually, he loves  all baby food from earth's best. I always heat the baby food and mix with rice cereal. He can finish 5 oz in 6 minuts. He will get angry if I feed too slow. I think he loves it. TL;DR My son love to eat these baby food"
"Good substitute for sugar, I like it much better than stevia, which to me has an awful after-taste.<br />I did notice though that the Erythritol isn't quite as sweet as sugar which can make it just a little expensive. TL;DR Tastes Good"
My son loves this!  It's a healthy snack for traveling with kids.  We are always looking for something easy to take with us and that is not filled with sugar...this is it! TL;DR This is GREAT!!!
"I ordered three (ugh!) of these sampler packages intended as gifts to people to whom I had previously given Keurig's.  What a disppointment to see that they come in distasteful brown paper bag packaging with a 90 day expiration sticker right on the front!  Shame on me for not reading all the details closer and the reviews ahead of time, which I now see have the same complaints about shoddy packaging and what appears to be someone's leftover flavors.  Buyer beware! TL;DR Crestfallen with disappointment."
Eating Gluten free is not always a pleasureable experience.  My wife and I found this product easy to make and tastes great too.  Makes great toast.  No after taste.  Buying on Amazon is the way to go...great prices.  Specialty shops are expensive.  We keep the extra packages in the refrigerator.  So far we have had no issues. TL;DR Great Tasting!
"My Am Staff is about 13 years old and is a very ""food-driven"" dog. He seems to like this version of Eukanuba just fine, although he is not a picky eater at all! The kibble seems to be a good size for him; some brands of ""large dog"" food are twice as big, which might be hard for older guys like mine!<br /><br />The price of these 30 lbs bags has gone up from the $40 range to the $50 range, but I know it is better for my dog than the Pedigree that is readily available at Smart & Final, so I stick with this Eukanuba.<br /><br />Plus, you all know the benefits of feeding your dog higher-quality dry food when you go out for a ""walk,"" right? ;-) TL;DR fine for 13 y.o. doggy"
I order these all the time from Sit Stay.  I highly recommend Sit Stay and Yummie Chummies! TL;DR My dogs love them
i've tried all kinds of energy drinks and dislike the metallic aftertaste of most of them.  i don't know why there are so many out as they basically taste all the same.  i really like steaz products.  this energy drink actually does have flavor and is good to drink.  it does give you energy without the quick burst and crash.  drink steaz and do your body good! TL;DR this is good tasting
"I received this golden delight as a Christmas gift.  This honey makes others pale in comparison!  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017TVA9I"">The Savannah Bee Company Honeycomb Box</a> TL;DR Bee-licious"
"I have to say this is a much harder item to review than I thought it would be.  I couldn't find another chia product locally for comparison, for one thing, and I've never eaten chia before, only watered it on a ""chia pet"".  But as I'm in the midst of a major overhaul of my diet, it seemed an appropriate food product to try.<br /><br />I will admit I didn't not try the cereal recipe on the back of the package, mostly because it requires additional Nutiva products that I don't have on hand.  Given the slightly crunchy texture even after soaking, I also didn't add it to my nutritional shakes.  Instead, I added the seeds to my fresh-cooked rolled oats/ground flax seed/random fresh fruit daily breakfast.<br /><br />The seeds come out of the package nice and white and consistent in size and shape, which makes it an appealing add-on.  Instructions call for the seeds to be soaked in warm water for 10 minutes prior to consumption, so I experimented with pre-soaking and various cooking times in the microwave with and without the pre-soak.  The best bet seemed to be to add the raw seeds to the raw oats and raw ground flax, add a bit more water than normal as the seeds tend to soak it up, then nuke for 3 minutes on 50% in a 1000 kw (that's a very small) microwave.  That left a bit of crunch all around while still making the seeds soft enough to eat and digest.<br /><br />The fiber level makes this a great dietary addition, especially for those just starting a high-fiber cholesterol-lowering regimen.  It's not as high as ground flax seed, which can be a plus if you tend to be sensitive to changes in fiber intake.  The combination of a tablespoon of Chia and a tablespoon of flax (that's about half the usual amount of flax) with 1/3 cup of thick-cut rolled oats was really nice both in texture and flavor.  The Chia is a tad sweeter than the nutty flavor of the flax.<br /><br />Quality control on the product appears to be excellent and the zip-lock package is good enough, though it lost its zip pretty quickly.  I didn't find any artifacts of the processing in the package, which is always a plus and not always a given.  I'm going to continue to use this product, and I can honestly recommend it to my fellow cholesterol-battlers as a tasty fiber option. TL;DR Interesting Fiber Source"
"I initially bought a 5 lb sack of Haribo Gummi Bears. They were decently run of the mill, a little chewy, and missing fruit juice and made in Turkey. I thought I would give these a go. Great choice. These gummi bears are made in USA, have a huge variety of flavors, and great texture at 75% of the price per lb. Sadly the one con on both is neither contained real juice TL;DR Fantastic deal, great flavors, Made in USA"
This is great soap. I don't like heavy scented soaps.  Dove men is the silky smooth liquid version of the old standby Dove Soap. Leaves me smooth and clean with the fresh Dove smell. I pack it in my gym bag for after swimming showers.  Nice stuff. TL;DR Dove clean in a bottle!
"I usually only bother with good reviews, but in this case, a review is more like a warning. This stuff was simply awful. I tried a bit and literally had to rinse out my mouth. Not sure why it is so bad, but it is. Better to go deal with the carbs from a bit of real brown sugar. TL;DR Just awful"
"These Marcona almonds are for the SERIOUS gourmet who is VERY hungry as they are shipped in a 50 pound box! Good for a candy making company, too, but for us regular people that just love FRESH nuts: You can get fresh Pecans at Sunnyland Farms dot com, and fresh English Walnuts or Almonds at california-almonds dot com. The prices and shipping are very reasonable, and bigger orders are discounted, PLUS get on their email list for notices of NEW CROPS each year! We have used these two sources, and they are excellent, always shipping only the finest ""new crop"" nuts! TL;DR Excellent GOURMET Marcona almonds in a HUGE box!"
"Since June 2011, the price went from $15 for 6 cans to almost $30 for 6. That is a terrible price jump. I love the oatmeal but not at that price. I will find another, cheaper, place to purchase. TL;DR I can't believe the price doubled!"
"Received the coffee and have been trying it out for a few days. I use an espresso machine to make my coffee..the bag doesn't say how much Kona is in the blend, but I can't imagine too much. The coffee doesn't have the smoothness of the real Kona, is a bit on the harsher side. Probably ok for a run-of-the-mill cofee, but not much better. Wish I had bought a smaller bag first! TL;DR not so kona!"
This product is a FAKE! It is billed as Lavender Honey but once I received it found out it is actually CLOVER HONEY flavored with lavender. What a disappointment; I felt dupped! TL;DR Product is a FAKE!
"This is a good tea.  The tea is very fine & actually gets through my fine mesh tea strainer.  Rishi makes their bowl tea with big fat leaves, not tea dust compacted together, similar to partical board.  That's why I gave it 4 stars.  I'd give it 3.5 if I could.  Rishi tea is far better.  Right now Amazon isn't offering it.  If you find you are able to try it, please do!  This is a VERY dark tea.  As black if not blacker than coffee!  The flavor is bold and intense.  You will either love it or hate it.  I don't think there is an in-between.  This tea is fermented/composted first giving it it's bold flavor.  Sounds nasty, but it works!  I've also read that this tea is used to support weight loss if your looking for a tea for that purpose.  Not for the faint of heart! By the way, I wouldn't call it a ""flowering"" tea.  It isn't shaped to open up like a flower.  If you leave it loose in your mug you will have to strain it.  It's in a bowl shape that isn't tied, but individually wrapped in paper.  You must remove the paper to brew it.  A tea brewer or bag is recommended. TL;DR Rishi is WAY better"
"Both of my dogs just love their treats!! They know exactly where their treats are kept and just can't get enough. The company delivered exactly what I had ordered in a speedy fashion. Highly recommended. TL;DR Beggin' Strips, Bacon Flavor"
Item arrived the next day in excellent condition; I was very pleased with the product and service.  These whirly pops have the best taste ever! TL;DR Very Pleased!
"I bought these and the greatest thing besides the awesome price and the fabulous beans is that the VP or CEO or some such lovely gentleman actually emailed me and thanked me for my purchase and when I responded, followed up again with a nice response! How nice is that in this day and age!<br /><br />I used these beans in my home made eggnog this year and it was out of this world. I first scraped the bean and then threw the pod in and left it there till the nog was gone. (not long)<br /><br />I also use one when I make my hot chocolate ""syrup"" (Lots of bittersweet chips, melted in milk and a little haff and half and the bean scraped and the pod - once again left in - I mske hot chocolate out of it by adding more milk to taste and a little bitty bit of brandy...decadent...oh my yes!)<br /><br />This is a great buy, great beans, great company! Buy with assurance! TL;DR Love the beans, love JR Mushrooms"
"I have purchased this twice, love the gum and it's far better than any on the market taste and health wise. TL;DR Great product"
If you like to scrape the pan after baking this product is worth trying. Brownie crunch also makes a fun ice cream topping. TL;DR Fun product to snack on and for use as a topping
Why so great!  It has a lot less sugar than the american version and the beans hold their shape after the processing system.  A lot less mushy than the american vegetarian version.  If you are looking for baked beans with a lot less sugar then this would work for you.  Super goodness. TL;DR The original heinz baked beans now on Amazon- how cool is that!
"My husband was tired of oatmeal and we needed<br />something organic, wholesome and delicious<br />to replace it.  Since it's healthier to eat a combination<br />of grains, we decided to try Heritage.  Hertiage Grains<br />come in flake or cheerio style and are naturally<br />fruit juice sweetened, so there is no need<br />for sugar!  Great way to start anyone's day! TL;DR Heritage Grains High Quality and Delicious"
The taste of the chick peas was overpowered by the curry and heat.  Definitely not as good as their other products. TL;DR not good
"If you like protein bars with good flavor and substance, you might wish to try these!  They are great for a snack or a quick protien pick me up meal on the go! TL;DR Great Meal or Snack!"
This is my favorite brand of Gluten Free Granola! This is now my favorite<br />Flavor. I have 18 auto-immune diseases and 4 of them have their own special<br />Diets. This flavor is the closest I could get- in this flavor there are only 2-3 things<br />I have to remove. I wish they would make one like Rainforest w/ no nuts<br />and no banana chunks - then it will be perfect. I highly recomend Bakery<br />on Main granola!!!! TL;DR Great Gluten Free Granola
We have been using barley flour and oat flour to mix with our regular whole wheat or while flour.  It adds a slightly different flavor and consistency to what we are baking -- but we really enjoy it! TL;DR Great to mix with other flours . . .
"PARTIES ROCK  THE BOAT, SO DO THESE CANDIES!!!!!!!  BUT THE BEST IS THESE CANDIES AT A PARTY.  SO POPULAR I BECOME TL;DR Ya."
"I bought the peanut butter flavored treats for my 9 week old Lab puppy and she LOVES them. They are perfect for training. She has learned 3 commands in one day with these treats. I was also very pleased to see that the first ingredient is peanut butter, not enriched flour. TL;DR Great treat for my puppy"
"Ordered direct from Amazon and got exactly what was promised - 35 different cups to try out and sample. My only complaint is that the product description lists several manufacturers and drink types (coffee, tea, iced tea, cocoa, cider, etc) yet the pack I got was heavily loaded with Green Mountain Coffee, more than half of the cups. Yes, different flavors or strengths, but same type of drink and same brand. Just wish it would of been a bit more even with the coffees/teas and not so loaded with Green Mountain (GM). 27 coffees (15 of which were from GM), and 8 ""other"" types of drinks.<br /><br />Good assortment to bring into work as there will be something for everyone to like, but like I said, just wish it was a little more even in the breakdown - or that Amazon offered a sampler of either ""only coffee"" or ""no coffee and only teas, ciders, cocoas"".<br /><br />Complete breakdown of what I got:<br />5 decaf (1 Newmans Own, 4 GM) - perfect for my pregnant coworker<br />1 half caff (GM)<br />1 iced tea (Celestral Seasonings)<br />1 regular tea (CS)<br />2 apple cider (Grove Square)<br />3 cappuccino (GS)<br />1 hot cocoa (GS)<br />4 extra dark/bold (GM)<br />4 flavored Gloria Jeans (hazelnut, butter toffee, mudslide, french vanilla supreme)<br />2 GM flavored coffees (southern pecan, caramel vanilla cream)<br />1 Kahlua<br />1 Donut Shop coffee<br />and 9 various other 'regular' types of coffees from GM and other brands. TL;DR Lots of variety in flavors, but not in drink types"
"I'm not sure why, but I had high hopes for this matcha. The price is wonderful, but the label on the box says it is a ""Product of USA"". Now, I have nothing against American-made goods, but matcha is something that has a history in Japan, and it's there that it has been perfected.<br /><br />I guess I should have been able to tell from the price that something was amiss, but I just held out hope that the fact that this product is culinary grade was explanation for the price.<br /><br />The taste isn't bad, it's just that it takes about 3 times as much matcha powder than normal to make my lattes. Once I add all the extra in, it's tasty. But if I use that much, then I might as well use the more expensive, authentic powder from Habiki-an. TL;DR bland... but not bad"
"These are among the best bars I've ever had. They are simply great.<br /><br />They are sweet, but not overly so.<br />Chewy, with a very good amount of crunchy nuts (almonds in particular) around them.<br />Natural sugars! (honey, non-gmo glucose), and the only relative<br /><br />Don't confuse them for health bars (these are better than most of them, 5g of fiber, no weird ingredients), or protein bars (though they do have 7g of protein), but obviously no comparison to sneakers or typical granola bars that have tons of sugar (these are just 4g per bar).<br /><br />All in, these are simply delicious, perfect blend of chewy and crunchy. And the ingredient list is something rare these days.<br />Oh they have a low glycemic index and are gluten free too. Did I mention they are delicious?<br /><br />The only down side is the price, of ~$1.50 per bar, even in a large pack. TL;DR Wow - Chewy, crunchy, delicious"
"These were really good. The box came with 10 small packs of cookies. The tasted like chocolate chip cookies to me.. a cookie on the outside and delicious creamy chocolate on the inside. Each cookie has a picture of a panda doing some kind of sport. I just wish the price or the shipping would be lower. It comes out being almost $10 for a box. =\ TL;DR Good, just wish it was cheaper."
Bamboo was sent and arrived in a timely fashion.  Plants were perfect.  I am a return customer and will continue to do business with them. TL;DR Great plants!
"Our dog has massive allergies and this is the first treat we have found that does not only make him very happy but does not cause him any issues.  He is 12 years old, is going blind, has a sensitive stomach and bad arthritis so you can imagine how great it is to find a treat that he can not only enjoy but can causes no harm.  To us, the side benefit is his teeth are doing great.  Does not need cleanings and has no bad breath.  I highly recommend these for all dogs. TL;DR Great Product"
"mush, bland pablum and almonds don't make a difference. I'm stuck w 3 unopened boxes. Isn't this supposed to be oat clusters w flakes? TL;DR Honey Bunches of..."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVPAXC"">Haribo Gummi Candy, Gummi Apples, 5-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I bought these (Using S&S!)to augment my standard purchase of the Haribo peach gummies that I have become addicted to, only to ignore the peach in favor of these BEYOND YUMMY Apple gummies.  OMG! Juicy, Yummy, and so like the Fuji Apples I crave.  The green and red ones are THE BEST, but the green and white ones are also refreshing.  When gone, I then began my, by now dull, Haribo peach gummies even as I yearned for more Apple!  GO for it!  And, these are also free of the allergens I have to avoid - - dairy, soy and gluten!  BEYOND YUMMM!  Is there a 10 star available?  No?  Then, Double 5!!<br /><br />AMZ- - (Are you paying attention?)  How about a spell checker here!?! TL;DR OMG!!!"
"This is a great product!  Rather than the highly processed turkey slices generally encountered in ""convenience"" foods, this gives you genuine chunks of cooked turkey breast with natural flavor.  I prefer it for sandwiches, and would not be afraid to substitute it for home-cooked turkey in any recipe.  (I suspect that turkey has lower fat content than chicken--if so, this product might be substituted advantageously for chicken in many uses). TL;DR Valley Fresh White Turkey in Water"
"This is a great all-natural hot treat.  I drink it all the time, though I add a small squeeze of maple syrup to my cup of hot brew. TL;DR Simply Delicious!"
This is the perfect drink for working out. It is refreshing and tastes really good.  It sounded terrible when my daughter first bought it but once I tasted it I was hooked. It always quenches my thirst. It beats every water I have ever had! TL;DR Water Snob
My mom made these for me years ago and I've loved them ever since. A great gluten free food and can be found for a pretty good price by some of the sellers on Amazon. I've come back again and again. TL;DR I love these!!
"I got my Aerogarden back in December, 2006. I have been seeing it sprout very well from when I first started using it December 18th to be exact. I'm almost to the point of clipping back the branches to let it grow even further. I'm so excited as I got the cherry tomato kit...<br /><br />My only cons are that the light it needs to grow under is extremely bright as another poster mentioned here. I wish they would have perfected it so it wouldn't bother us being so bright. If you have a place where you can keep it out of your sight it will help. If I had a larger place I'd have gotten 2 Aerogardens for sure!<br /><br />IT is a bit expensive I think as well... But on the upside you could order it at Aerogarden's website with 3 installments of $49.99 which I am currently under here. So in that way that helps make it affordable.<br /><br />Also they need to make it even a possibly cuter design... Maybe they are working on this? LOL...<br /><br />Also wondering if they'll make it so we can grow more then one ""kit"" at a time too? That would be great as well.<br /><br />I hope you'll get this! Like I said if I had a bigger place I'd get 2. You'll love to watch it grow quick! TL;DR Awesome little garden! It's so much fun to watch it grow :-)"
"This drawer is just awesome for holding the K-cups when the boxes get nearly empty, and it seems pointless to store them on the shelf.  It keeps the k-cups nice and dry and handy.  Best of all is that the machine can rest safely on the top, giving it it's own little area in the kitchen, kind of like a little break room.  We love this, and the shelf we bought to hang on the wall to hold the boxes. TL;DR HA!  This thing is AWESOME."
Spend a little extra money and get the real stuff...and quite honestly you will never go back to that stuff that pretends to be maple syrup.<br />Grade B is what we prefer in my household because of the stronger maple taste.<br />Amazon has wonderful sales on this product which makes it much more affordable. Believe me when I say...ditch your fake maple syrup and go for the real stuff. TL;DR Don't buy any of that fake maple syrup...Buy this!
I changed jobs at work and my days of 90 minute lunches are over. Some days I am lucky to get 5 minutes. I now stock my drawers at work anytime I see decent food on sale at Amazon. These have come in handy more than once. TL;DR Quick and tasty
"Our service dog needed a change of diet because of allergies. She had to have something never consumed. I was worried she would not eat it.<br />After four months, she loves it still. It reminds me of some stupid pet food comercial on TV. TL;DR California Natural Salmon and Sweet Potato"
"My family is addicted to crispy, salty snacks and I've tried a few different kinds of chips trying to find a healthier alternative to the junk food they all love.<br /><br />I like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DZIL24"">Terra Krinkle Cut Sweet Potato Sea Salt</a> chips for their high level of vitamin A. But they are also high fat, and the texture and flavor don't appeal to my daughter.<br /><br />These chips don't have any vitamin A according the to the label, but they are low calorie, low fat and low sodium. The texture and flavor are a definite hit with everyone in my family, even my very picky daughter.<br /><br />The sweet potato chips aren't too sweet or too salty and they don't feel greasy at all. They are really crisp. The flavor is a little bland, but it also doesn't have the aftertaste that some vegetable chips can have.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the chips is rice flour, not sweet potatoes.<br /><br />I'd like these better if they had more going for them nutritionally. The Terra chips are higher in dietary fiber, vitamin A and C.<br /><br />I plan to try some of the other flavors soon. I think they would be a wonderful topping for casseroles if they stay crispy enough. TL;DR Great crispy crunch and flavor"
"These are just so darn good!!  Always fresh and just the right snack!  Have a little, have a lot!  Your choice! TL;DR Yum!"
"I purchased the Leonidas Chocolates from Amazon about a month ago.  My wife and I love chocolate. After reading the raving reviews I felt this would be a great gift.  The shipping was very quick, so no complaints there.  The chocolate had a nice flavor, but we were not impressed with the fillings. If we had to choose, the hazelnut was the best in the box, followed by a white chocolate that was good.  For the price, you can find better chocolate elsewhere. TL;DR eh, just ok"
"I had never used pink peppercorns before and must admit to my surprise that they are actually a very good addition to my spice rack.<br /><br />These are very mild peppercorns and as described, they do indeed have a sweet, somewhat fruity flavor mixed in with a wonderful peppery taste.  Let's face it, they also look pretty cool.<br /><br />I have been using them on different fish dishes (I use it as a rub) with quite a lot of success.  I also used them with several other spices and herbs in a bottle of olive oil for salads.  They added much to the flavor of my mix.  Do take warning though, you use these rather sparingly as the flavor can overwhelm other spices you may be using.<br /><br />This is not a spice that I use everyday, but it is one that I am glad I added to my cooking arsenal.  The same old spices dish after dish gets a bit old and it is nice to be able to dazzle things up a bit from time to time.<br /><br />I like this product. TL;DR Nice addition to my kitchen"
"I have been looking for a natural no calorie sweetener for a long time.  I think stevia is the way to go.  I had bought a powder form of stevia, but it did not dissolve very good in my beverages, so I really like the liquid form of stevia. I do not think you will be able to find a better price for this product out there. TL;DR Best price"
"Great drink and a great taste as well. 10,000% better than 5 hour energy in both energy and taste. As well as no crash. TL;DR Great taste, and gives you a great burst of energy."
"I tasted this at the Olive Pit in Corning, CA on an olive burger this summer and I couldn't get over it.  I eat a lot of hot sauce and I believe this is the best I've ever tasted.  It is now a staple in my fridge. TL;DR Hands Down the Best"
"Organic suckers that are a delicious way<br />to guard against dry mouth, especially<br />with a sore throat without unwanted chemicals!<br /><br />I ordered the 30 count containers<br />for xmas gifts/snacks.<br /><br />A great crowd pleaser<br />for children of all ages! TL;DR ORGANIC SUCKERS!"
This Organic Baby food is very tasty but has a very thin consistency..my son has to drink it. It is also very sweet. Nice as a desert but not for a meal for my 10 month old. TL;DR tasty
These noodles are fantastic. I could eat them for dinner almost every night of the week along with their other Annie's counterparts. Cooked meal in less than 30 minutes. You cannot beat the taste! I love adding coconut oil and chia seeds to them as well. It only enhances the flavor and adds some nutritional extras if you so desire. They are fine the way they come but I find this adds something extra and they taste amazing prepared this way. TL;DR Yum!
"I bought this pot for a wisteria bonsai plant.  The pot is smaller than the picture looks but is the size of the measurements that are listed.  I think the picture of the pot looks bigger than it is and I should have read it more carefully.  The pot is pretty, it is level and appears to be a nice thickness.  I am starting the wisteria bonsai from a seed, so this pot will still be ok for that and depending how quickly the plant grows will determine how long I may be able to use it. TL;DR nice pot"
We love this honey.  Great flavor.  Arrived quickly and it great condition.  I like that it isn't overly processed.  Would buy this again. TL;DR Wow!  This is great honey!
My dogs have always loved nylabone's and they are a great value as they last for months. My pups will chew on these for hours and hours. Slap a little peanut butter on them for an extra treat! TL;DR Nylabone Always Delivers
"This product also contains a whopping 29 grams of carbohydrates which will spike your blood sugar and lead to fat storage, not loss.  You'd be better off with a scrambled egg and low-fat sausage. TL;DR Probably Won't Help Weight"
"This is absolutely awesome! OK, so it may have sugar, but with oatmeal and apples, you still can't go wrong. The flavor is oh, so fine. One caution: it's a little wait for it to cool down enough to eat, so please be careful. And one problem: the price is simply outrageous. It's awesome, but too doggone pricey. Bought mine at Sam's Club at an excellent price only to never see it on the shelves again which is downright sad. All the same, try it and enjoy! TL;DR Doesn't get much better"
"THIS Cutter Insect Repellent with Picaridin is safer and less strong odor that DEET products.  It was not on retail stores this Summer (2011)in my area of the country.  Amazon was the only place where I could find it.  If you are faced with a dense mosquito population, pour in on legs on knees & below allowing it to run into socks.  Just spraying it will often not give full saturation and bugs have a way of finding that bare spot.  DEET products are available everywhere and may last longer, but read the warnings about the risk of long term or heavy dose of  DEET. TL;DR Insect Repellant  - Child safe"
"This pasta was very good! I was a bit skeptical at first about the pre-cooked pasta in a container that did not need to be refrigerated, but I ate it and had no ill side effects :)<br /><br />The instructions to heat up the pasta and sauce were simple and because it's not a frozen meal, it only took about 1:30 in the microwave. The pasta was cooked well. The sauce, while simple marinara, was really good. Just enough seasoning to make it taste good without taking away from the great tomato taste. The marinara was also chunky and not pureed or watery or runny.<br /><br />Overall a very good product that I would eat again. TL;DR Very tasty!"
"I have tried many K cups and some are hits and others are just plain misses. This one is a HIT! I don't like strong, bitter tasting coffee. This one has a smooth, mild taste that I love. I normally only drink one cup of coffee per day, but I have found myself craving this for an afternoon treat. I will definitely be purchasing this flavor again. TL;DR It's great!"
THE PACKAGING IS GREAT AND IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR THE POPPER WE GOT. THE ONLY THING I DON'T LIKE IS THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET THE CONTENTS TO POUR INTO THE KETTLE PROPERLY WITHOUT MAKING A MESS. HAVE TO PUT IN A SEPERATE CONTAINER WITH A SPOUT. THE FLAVOR IS GREAT!! TL;DR PERFECT PORTIONS
"The coffee is great. It is my favorite K-Cup so far. However, there were coffee grounds all over most of my K-Cups. Oddly, they were all intact, so I'm not really sure where the grounds came from. I tried cleaning them off. Still, when I brew them I get more coffee grounds in my cup than any other brand I've tried to date. It is still a great flavor, but I wish the manufacturer or Amazon would be more careful with the product. TL;DR Coffee is great. Potential quality control, packing, or shipping issue."
"It's hard to find the broccoli in this chunky soup, since it's the size of parsley flakes. It's best used as a dip or similar. There are better Progresso soups. TL;DR Not the best"
"We bought this popcorn to go with a machine we had purchased, and the machine ended up not working.  So we took these portion packs of popcorn and used them on the stove top.  They worked great, everyone said it was good popcorn.  Would definitely buy this again, even if you just do it on the stove top, it's so easy having everything bundled into one package and ready to use! TL;DR Great Popcorn!"
Exactly what I needed. Wasnt hard to find or to know which one I needed. No plumbing company to charge me to take one out and put one in.  Thanks TL;DR So much cheaper than going through a Furnace co.
This is a very lite sweet tasting cinnamon just as cardamom I was impressed by super fast shipping excellent packaging.<br />I wanted to get true cinnamon from the source excellent product trying it with raw honey for my joints!!Wish me luck everyone. TL;DR excellent !
"I have been using this seasoning for 6 years now and it is my ""go to"" seasoning. Like the other reviewer said it complements all meats and fish, it also excellent for cooked greens. But my favorite is to use it for making homemade salad dressing instead of buying over priced salad seasoning packs or premade dressings. I too appreciate that it has no MSG and it has no artificial ingredients! Thanks for keeping it real Konriko:) TL;DR Fabulous"
This is one of my best buys you can find for the money. If your studying Japanese and you would like to learn more about the culture this the one for you. The candy in this product is nothing like the kind we have hear in america. The Pocky Sticks are great I would recommend ordering there pocky sticks bundle as well. Man I love this stuff. The had some gum that tastes like milk and strawberry very great.<br /><br />Please buy this package the high chew candy is off the chain You will be coming back for more I'm sure of it. TL;DR Great Product
"Seller is excellent!  Love the product but not the price.  A few days after purchasing, I went the BJs Warehouse and saw the same bottle for $5 or $6. TL;DR Love the product not the price"
"I have tried all kinds of decaf coffee & this is my favorite POD decaf coffee by far.  It's just a nice medium strength coffee w/out that nasty, sharp decaf taste.  It is not bitter.  Keep in mind that I usually drink it either black w/a bit of honey & sometimes with cream. TL;DR Have loved it for a year."
$4.99 - when i can buy it in the local store for $2.79?? I don't think so. TL;DR Great product - ridiculous price!
"These packets are easy to store and squeeze, and the caps make them easy to reseal.  The pear-spinach puree makes a great, low-calorie, no-added-sugar topping for plain oatmeal.  And my kids like it as a snack!  It's convenient and better for them than fruit roll-ups. TL;DR Yummy snack and oatmeal topping! Kids like it too"
"When I travel I bring a wide ceramic mug, plastic spoons, baggies of this, and instant oatmeal packets (Dr McDougall's are good). I put the fruit in the mug first, then the oatmeal, and cover with hot water from the coffee maker. The fruit softens up perfectly for a great healthy breakfast or late night snack. They are also good for straight snacking, but there are less expensive brands. I recommend trying these and Sensible Foods cherry fruit blend to compare on taste and price. TL;DR Good but overpriced"
IT SAYS ON THE BOX EACH DRINK CONTAINS: THE POTASIUM OF 2 BANANAS & MORE ELECTROLITES THAN A SPORTS DRINK. THEY MIGHT SEEM A LITTLE HIGH PRICED BUT GO TO GROECERY STORE BUY 2 BANANAS & 2 SPORTS DRINKS AND YOU WILL PAY MORE TO GET THE SAME NUTRITION YOU GET FROM 1 JUICE BOX OF THIS COCONUT WATER... TL;DR EXCELLENT
This cereal tastes great! I wouldn't recommend it for people that don't like too much sweetness or sugar. I have to order it from Amazon because I can't seem to find this ceareal in any stores in my area like they used to be. TL;DR Love this cereal!
"I am a jerk lover and I had never tried these. Boy, what I have been missing.  These have so much flavor and the pepper.  Hands down best slices ever. TL;DR Great jerky slices"
"I use to purchase this product at Costco for half the price,although I really like the product it's too expensive.. TL;DR soy energy blend"
"I love buttermilk and use it in all sorts of things - oven-fried chicken, biscuits, pancakes, cake, you name it - if the recipe calls for milk you can bet I've tried substituting buttermilk on a whim.  Thing is the local stuff around here, while excellent, is pricey and I always forget about the half a bottle left over in the back of my fridge until after it's gone bad.<br /><br />I got a canister of this buttermilk powder as backup for when I don't have fresh and I really like it.  It adds a lovely flavor and is so convenient!  I don't use water, however, I use milk to give the recipe a little more substance.  I make sure to always have some on-hand in my pantry and recommend it to others. TL;DR One of my must-have pantry items!"
My 8 month old loves this & has no problem holding it & sucking the food out.  This is great for on the go! TL;DR Yum-Yum MishMash
"My regular matzo farfel was out of stock so I decided to try this whole grain version as a healthy alternative. Big Mistake. Before you order this stuff, make sure you taste some whole grain matzo first --- if you like the flavor than go ahead. It comes out much darker and more fibrous than regular matzo farfel. In our family this stuff was a big flop. My wife decided to throw the other five cans in the garbage as she didn't want to try and save this purchase by mixing it with regular matzo farfel --- so for me this product was a total loss. TL;DR Tastes Like Cardboard"
"I can't say enough good about Eden's Wakame.  I absolutely love it and prepare a simple raw wakame salad from one 2.1 ounce package at least once a week. Furthermore and most importantly to me as a raw vegan resident of Florida, it is a must have in my hurricane pantry for it soaks quickly providing a highly nutritious fresh green vegetable.  This product is truly a delicious and nutritious gift from the sea. I should also add that it is a good buy here at Amazon. TL;DR Fantastic nutritional gift from the sea!"
"I have used this rice for nearly 20 years.  Outstanding product.  I suppose it was my fault not reading the quantity in this order.  Having purchased before and expecting at least 6 packages of rice, I was very frustrated to see only one.  For the price of $6.75 fo one packet.  I would say this was a rip off.  I will never buy from Monica R Abel again. TL;DR Mahatma Wild Rice / Monica R Abel"
"Simply the ""BEST""  It's the best I ever had, and you get it at the best price available.  A double win! TL;DR Great Beef Jerky"
"I'm not sure why previous reviewers have said that their children couldn't eat these because they were too hard. My 11 month old doesn't have any molars and he eats them two at a time, and loves them!!! I tasted them and they are rather tasteless, but if my kid likes them, who cares!<br /><br />I purchased these on a whim at the supermarket when my son was 10 months because I liked the fact that there wasn't a lot of sugar in it. Also, it's organic and contains all whole grains. TL;DR 11 month old loves them"
"I have to be upfront and tell you my family loves these but I do not. I do not like baked Lays or Pringles either. This product reminded me of them, not the same but similar. My son wanted me to try them and then invest in the company. I am glad so many people like them but I will pass on eating them and it looks like it is a private company.... So no stock either. TL;DR Family loved them but this is MY review"
"I saw the one negative review here and because the price I was about to pay was exceptionally cheap(it was on some sort of special at the time), I decided to take a chance. I have to report that my experience was quite the opposite of the negative review I read. The order I recieved was fresh and the product is excellent. I love torrone and this is very good. My only criticism is simply that torrone itself is so good, coating it in chocolate, beleive it or not, only detracts from the enjoyment IMHO. If other varieties had been available at the sale price I paid, I'd likely have chosen the plainer or simpler variety over this one.<br /><br />The only other point I'd like to make is that it is true that Amazon is notorious for sending out stale and near out of date grocery items. Old stuff seems to be especially true when it's on one of their specials. The previous reviewer may well have recieved a bad shipment as they described. Whether it was luck or timing, the order I got was very good and it was exceptionally cheap. TL;DR Maybe its  timing ?"
Fastest delivery ever! I feel like I ordered it and turned around and it was at my door! Well packaged too. I can't get this same price at my local store and I ended up saving almost a dollar a can buying through amazon :) I love these beans because they are organic AND THE CAN IS BPA FREE!!! It is very hard to find BPA free cans. You should shout about this detail in your description. TL;DR AWESOME!
"I love to drink this tea especially on a cold day after a long walk with the dog, or curled up in bed in the evening letting the soft smells and gentle taste roll over me.  This comes in a multi-pack, so no more surprises that I am out and a trip to the store is in order, with a multitude of great teas to sample.  As far as herbal teas go, you cannot do much better than these simple but timeless teas. TL;DR Good Tea With Convenience"
"The rose syrup was very good. The rose flavor could be stronger for my taste, but I would  buy it again. TL;DR rose syrup"
"These Stilia bars are wonderful. They taste great, are only 100 calories and my whole family loved them - especially the rabbits. They're quite filling and the juxtoposition of a crunchy outside with a jam-like inside made for an excellent snack. The only downside is that we haven't been able to find these in our local supermarkets. I will say that these are extremely fragile and that sometimes you'll end up with some broken bars before you even open the wrapper. Doesn't make them taste any less awesome though! TL;DR Delicious and Filling!"
The same stuff that you buy at the store...only you don't have to go to the store! I'm now stocked and ready to make a shabbat brisket on a moment's notice! TL;DR Excellent
I love the taste of oats and I am addicted to these things.  Delicious with a Cranberry Walnut cheese spread.  Like a mini-cheesecake! TL;DR yum!
"Pill Pockets make the unpleasant task of having to think about your pet's illness much easier by taking the frustration out of giving medication.  Instead of having to use a piller to force a pill down their throat, they think they are getting a treat.  It works very well.  After having to use a piller on my cat for about a month, I woke up in the middle of the night after having a dream about a treat that could hold the pill in it.  I was ready to make at least a hundred thousand bucks.  Then I did a google search and it turns it already exists -- so I'm sending them my money instead.  Oh well...it's an excellent product. TL;DR Pill Pockets make an unpleasant task much easier"
"My dogs loved this product. I used it to flavor their kibble. The package is small and the price is too high. If price is not a concern, then I recommend it. Otherwise it's too pricey. TL;DR Pricey gravy"
"Can't go wrong with a good old Tootsie Pop but leave it to the people at Tootsie Roll to improve upon an already good thing.  They have added a Pomegranate flavor!  While not really my cup of tea, a lot of people (I bought this for the office) were excited to see this addition.  Very good and EXCELLENT price! TL;DR They have a new Pomegranate flavor!"
"This is a great mix for a 9x13 or two round pans.  It's plenty of dough to do the job nicely.  This came out nice and moist and provides a great base for experiments...  We wanted a lemon cake one day for a special birthday for my husband's celiac mother.  We used a little lemon extract and lemon zest in the cake.  After it was baked we mixed a little sugar with lemon juice, heated it and poured in on top the cake after first poking the cake with a toothpick to create small holes for absorbing our yummy sweetened lemon concoction.  Sorry I can't tell you my proportions as I simply guessed (a habitual way of approaching cooking for me).  Think creatively and enjoy, knowing that you're starting with a great base! TL;DR Yummy, even better than we hoped!"
"I got this for my hubby, who is the real coffee drinker around here.  The smell when it's brewing is so delicious.  It smells sweet and kind of caramel-ish.  The coffee is smooth, and the flavor is subtle but definitely there.  We brew it in a Keurig machine using the filter attachment.  Definitely worth repurchasing. TL;DR Smells fantastic when brewing"
"These meals are greasy, disgusting and actually made be feel woozy for a few hours after eating. I would not recommend eating this. I can't return it but want to give it away. Perhaps i will find a homeless man to give it to. TL;DR Absolutely horrible."
I recommend using half water and half skim milk. I usually mix 5 oz water with 5 oz skim milk and heat in the micro for two minutes.  Add the packet and sugar or sweetener.  Great for a quick cup of coffee without the hassle of cleaning the machine. TL;DR Actually tasty!
"Oh, My, If you like toco's and if your reading this you do this is the seasoning to have. Our local Groc. stopped carring it and I about lost it... amoazon to the resQ! I'm going to buy more of my faves on line this perchase went so well! TL;DR This stuffisthebomb ""Ya!"""
I would like to reorder but this excellent product is currently unavailable. I was very happy with my first order and I hope they come back soon. TL;DR Excellent Product
"I mean I was really excited to use this. I don't actually wash my hair myself-i'm no good at it. So I took both the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9FQ"">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Ultra Shea Cleanse & Nourish Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> and the conditioner to my salon and I really felt the difference. I get deep condition and It was light and I could tell my hair was easy to manage afterwards. I'm really glad I bought it, and I look forward to using it again and reordering once I'm out. My favorite Shampoo and conditioner so far. TL;DR So Good You Can Feel It"
"I buy this product all the times when amazon has it available with the free super saving shipping. My daughter is 18 months and still loves it. I mix it with milk instead of water. Another great one the cereal vegetables, since she does not eat veggies everyday I try to balance it out by giving the cerelac vegetables Too bad it's not always available at amazon. TL;DR Best cereal"
"SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either.  I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice.  The can design is pleasant to look at.<br /><br />I thought the Black Cherry flavor tasted a bit too apple-ly, but my wife really liked the flavor.  Also, at 130 calories per can, this beverage has almost 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda.  Too many for me. TL;DR It's okay"
"Great product-best price I've found. Put some in a smaller container and store remainder in the freezer--always tastes fresh! Use in salad,cereal,soups,baking or just have a spoonful--good protein source. TL;DR Nutiva Hemp Seed"
"Love the flavor on this mac n cheese, but making the noodles right takes practice--what works in your microwave won't work at work, or at your friends' houses. But that's okay, because having this healthier alternative, with no nasty chemicals or hormones is worth a few trials and errors.<br /><br />Serving size is small for an adult and a bit large for a child, but so? Make two and steal some of your kid's. TL;DR Love it; perfect noodles take practice"
We are big coffee/tea drinkers. Tastes just like sugar. No difference. We also have the pump which makes it so easy to use. TL;DR Good Product
Other reviews have detailed the benefits of this coffee maker.  I just wanted to add that the coffee you brew up can be very easily stored.  Just let it cool a bit and then place the carafe in the fridge.  The coffee doesn't come out bitter (probably because it doesn't sit on a hot burner).  I used a french press for a long time but it's now gathering dust thanks to this coffee maker. TL;DR Excellent for multiple cups
"Thankfully it is getting easier to find great tasting gluten free products. we have two members of our family who can't eat gluten due to medical issues so we have to shop with that in mind. Many gluten-free offerings taste dodgy or ""off"" but this product is an exception. We had this for dinner last night and it was great. We served it with shrimp and tomato sauce and everyone loved it. We will definitely get this brand again next time we have a chance. TL;DR Tastes great!"
"I was one of the lucky moms out there that got picked to receive a MomVoxBox  from Influenster. When I opened the box my youngest son Jordan was sitting with me. Before I had a chance to see what it was he took it and ran off. I was surprised by this, but I opened it up for him and he ate it right up. See my son Jordan is Autistic and he is a very picky eater. He is also picky about his snacks. He hates raisins, I have never been able to get him to eat them . But he loved the Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies. Ever since we received these when he sees a Quaker cookie box we have to buy it he thinks they are the same cookies. These are so great they come in their own wrappers so you can take them when you are on the run and they are way healthier then most cookies out there. TL;DR Picky Eater loves them"
"My dog use to get, and actually still can get, cronic ear infections, but this product has finally gotten the problem under control.  I use it once a week and no longer have ear infection trouble.  I used to to get rid of his current ear infecton and now keep using it to make sure it doesn't come back.  Great product and highly recommended! TL;DR Excellent Product!"
"Cameron's is a great tasting coffee and a great value for the price.  This particular favorite--along with the toasted pecan--is my favorite.  I'm a picky coffee drinker, and I'm impressed by the quality of this coffee.  The smell is intoxicating and the flavor is unmatched.  I often buy several of these 32-ounce bags and keep them in the freezer.  They stay fresh for several months.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Don't grind it until you're about to use it and toss in a French Press for best results. TL;DR Great tasting coffee; great value!"
"This cotton candy tastes like plain sugar, like eating a spoonful straight from the sugar bowl. It does have that nice, melt-in-your-mouth texture that characterizes cotton candy. It is pink colored and has a very slight ""warm"" aftertaste. There is no cinnamon flavor or smell. It is quite disappointing when expecting the spicy taste of the chewy, oblong Hot Tamales candy. There is not even the traditional vanilla flavor that makes carnival and fairground cotton candy so tasty.<br /><br /> In contrast, Spun City Cotton Candy, sold on Amazon, is a delicious treat. Spun City Cotton Candy costs more, but it's made with superior ingredients and has very good flavor. Kid's will probably eat the Hot Tamale Cotton Candy and be happy, (it is almost pure sugar, after all) but to someone who wants a bit of taste in the mix, this one is likely to be a letdown. TL;DR Does not taste like Hot Tamales Candy"
"I REALLY LOVE THIS STUFF!!!! Such a sweet, creamy indulgence that I can enjoy without guilt!<br />My favorite was the Chocolate Peanut Butter until the Chocolate Mint Cookie became available!!<br />Chocolate Mint Cookie is YUMMMMY!!!! I like to mix it with blueberries or some plain nonfat greek yogurt and sprinkle some ginger on top! YUM!!!<br /><br />Arctic Zone doesn't increase my desire for more sweets like some frozen desserts can! I like that I can indulge almost daily and not worry about weight gain!!<br /><br />Its also perfect for those times you want a lil something sweet throughout the day, even a spoonful goes a looong way for my tastebuds!!<br /><br />I love that there's 4 grams of protein in each serving and that it has 2 grams of fiber! I've never heard of a frozen dessert with fiber?! Way to go Arctic Zone peeps!!<br /><br />I can't eat an entire pint in one sitting, but sometimes can in a day, but, thats only if Im home all day...lol... a little goes a long way and I love that! When I used to get frozen yogurt with Splenda (can't believe I used to do that) in it (low-carb fro yo), whenever I had some, I always wanted more. With Artic Zone, I am satiated with just a serving or two.<br /><br />I am sooo grateful they came out with this! I would love a coconut flavor if possible??? or Banana cream pie??? Price is cheaper than indulging in fro-yo each day and much more friendly to your curves!!! :) I plan to take a few pints to the family's Thanksgiving Feast for family to try. TL;DR Tasty Lil Spoonfuls of Heaven!!!!"
"I absolutely love coconut water.  I don't drink a ton of regular water a day.  So I use this to supplement my intake.  I drink one 11 ounce box a day.  It makes a real difference in my skin and hair as well.  Much more moisterized and hydrated.  It also keeps me a little more regular.  This is chock full of benefits.  I give my 10 month old 1/4c of it when he seems constipated.  My pediatrician agreed it was a good idea.  Do your research.  I was sorry to see that the 34 oz boxes were not available on the ""Prime"" shipping program.  Now I order 11 oz boxes on autoship.  Look into it, once you try coconut water you will never want to be without!!!!! TL;DR If you haven't tried, you gotta!"
This cake was very good...moist and just sweet enough.  Just not as coconutty as I would have liked.  Have had better from Wegmans at a fraction of the price. TL;DR Good but not Great
"This my absolute favorite flavor of tea ever! The lavender adds a burst of fragrance and a subtle hint of sweetness which softens typically harsh earl grey tea. Excellent tea, very mild. TL;DR Very good tea!"
"I am so upset I ever gave my baby this poison.<br /><br />Read for yourself. Just google ""baby's only arsenic"" and read the study done by Dartmouth University.<br /><br />Obviously the researchers did not name Baby's Only formula in fear of a lawsuit. Nevertheless you can put 1 and 1 together and figure out the only formula on the market that uses organic brown rice syrup.<br /><br />I feel sick right now. TL;DR Inorganic arsenic detected- exceeds 20x that of other formula"
"I got my 6-pack in a larger bag that was packed in a cardboard box about 2 weeks ago - no tears or rips in any of the packs. Thanks to the Amazon Subcription Service, cat litter is now delivered to my door with free shipping and I don't have to lug a 20lb bag from the store anymore.<br /><br />Reason for the 4 stars: Poop still sticks to the pellets and I lose a few everytime I scoop, and it does not control poop odor. But that's ok, I just use an air freshener spray. I use 1.5 bags each time since 1 pack doesn't seem to be enough.<br /><br />Anyway, the pellets are washable! I was curious - so I tried and the pellets weren't all that dirty anyway as I had already scooped the dirty (pop-covered) ones out. I poured the used litter into the bottom part of an old hooded litter box that had hot water and detergent in it (I use the hood for the Breeze litterbox!). I let it soak for about 20 mins whilst I washed and dried the Breeze litter box, changed the pee pad, and poured in a new bag of litter. I used an old kitchen/dish brush that has a long handle and sort of ""scrubbed"" the used pellets in the soapy water for a few minutes and then drained the water into the toilet bowl and then rinsed it out a number of times until the water was clear. Drained it as much as I could, and then left the box in the bathtub with the window open to air-dry it, and closed the tub screen so my cat wouldn't think he had an extra litter box in the bathtub! The pellets were clean and completely dry within 2-3 days. Kinda interesting that it can be washed and we're not generating more garbage to pollute the earth. Plus, for anyone wanting to save some money.... TL;DR Works, but still sticks to poop. Washable!"
"I'm a huge fan of raw cacao powder, and this is by far the best powder I've had. Its high quality with a wonderful taste. And the price for the 2 bags is much cheaper on amazon then I can find in any store around me. I will DEFINITELY be ordering this again when I run low on raw cacao powder!!!! TL;DR awesome!!"
"As a gluten sensitive individual, I have found Bob's Redmill gluten free oatmeal allows me to use oatmeal in many recipies and just as a<br />cereal that was off limits to me before.  It's a very good product.<br /><br />This was an Amazon verified purchase. TL;DR gluten free oatmeal"
I love these noodles and will always order them. They are great to take for lunch and always taste great! TL;DR greatest instant noodles
"I've tried many different K-Cup blends and this is by far my favorite.  It is the perfect coffee - not too bold, and not too weak.  Give it a try! TL;DR Best K-Cup I've Had"
"These new sauces from Progresso are wonderful.  Each can makes 4 servings - with a recipe on the side of the can.  By going to http://progresso.com/RecipeStarters you can find lists of ideas for each of the sauces.  Purchasing a multi pack won't mean that your family has to have Parmesan chicken every day for 6 weeks.  The recipes are interesting and varied - from the standard pasta and sauce to pizza, rice dishes, casseroles and sandwiches.  These sauces make being a great cook easy!  I received a sample and coupons to try these products from BzzAgent - I love being a BzzAgent! TL;DR Delicious and easy with great ingredients"
"Puppy was ready to transition off of her puppy food and I knew I wanted a grain free product. After much internet research and talking to other dog parents, I chose TOTW.<br /><br />PRO:<br />She likes the taste of the food. My dog doesn't eat right away always, but she seems more enthusiastic about this than her puppy food.<br />Firm stools!! I had tried four different puppy formulas and her last was better but finally her stools are consistently firm.<br />Softer and shinier coat.<br />High quality food means your dog needs less food, making the bag last.<br /><br />CON:<br />The smell is overpowering, but I keep her food in an airtight container, so it's not too bad. It isn't so overpowering that having her food sit out is offensive.<br />I'm a huge fan of Amazon, but the shipping of this product was poor. The box was practically falling open and the delivery man left the box in a puddle on the floor of our building entry instead of in front of my door (as they normally do).<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />I will continue to purchase this food for my dog. After the second bag, I will switch her to one of the other TOTW flavors since that is what was recommended for her. TL;DR Puggle finally has firm stool"
"This flavor sounded like it would be good, like ice creamy, and it seemed to get lots of positive reviews here on Amazon. So when I came across a small sample box at Lowe's of the stuff, I bought it. Unfortunately. This ""coffee"" tastes like old dishwater in which a pair of running shoes and a vanilla-scented car air freshener were steeped for a week. TL;DR Naaaaaaaaaaaaasty."
"My counter is starting to look like a coffee house.  I use sugar-free syrups and my husband uses regular, so we have a few each.  These pumps make it easy and less messy (if you are careful).  Also easy to put exactly the same amount in each time without making more dishes dirty. They are machine washable too (top). TL;DR Makes adding syrup easy"
Came fast! was exactly what was advertised im super happy! will buy again! bought this for my mom and she drinks it every day!<br /><br />Thanks a lot! TL;DR AWESOME TRANSACTION!!!!!!!!!
"I have a 60 pound Golden Retriever. She drops at least a kitten worth of hair a week and I had been constantly finding balls of hair that have drifted under furniture every time I sweep the hardwood floors. I've been using the FURminator shampoo for a couple years and that definitely helps. The one bummer with the shampoo is that hair is flying off of her for several hours after a bath. It's excellent at getting the hair loose but it doesn't all come off in the bath. The conditioner seems to solve that problem. I would estimate that the amount of hair in the hair trap after giving her a bath is about double when I use the conditioner after using the shampoo and I no longer have the hair blowout problem for a couple hours after her bath. Don't get me wrong, she still sheds but not anywhere near as much. Now the ongoing battle of everything being covered in dog hair is a winnable battle. The amount of daily shedding that occurs is significantly less as well. My Golden has problems with allergies and can be sensitive to a lot of products. I've seen absolutely no reaction to either the shampoo or this conditioner on her. If your pooch isn't so thrilled about having to sit in the tub for five minutes while the condition does it's magic, try smearing some peanut butter on the wall of the tub. I have found that to be an excellent distraction for her. TL;DR Significantly fewer hair balls under the couch and bookcases"
"Love this Watermelon Essence water!  It is so refreshing!  I am really bad about drinking water throughout the day, but this product makes it easy.  I look forward to drinking it now. TL;DR Yummy!!"
"I've always been a huge fan of Cornnuts, so when I saw them at amazon, I couldn't help myself! It's a great deal, you get 36 packages for around 20 bucks - I usually pay a dollar for one pack at my local grocery store.  And its a great way to satisfy your munchie needs!  That being said, I think that ranch is the BEST flavor they've got out, followed by the chile con limon one. TL;DR OMG"
"I have tased a variety of molasses brands over the years , and Brer Rabit is definitely the best . I use it to make BBQ sauce and baked beans. For gingerbread cookies and other dishes, I prefer the Dark version of Brer Rabbit , rather then the Bladkstrap . My dog also loves Blackstrap Brer Rabbit molasses. The only way she will eat dry dog food is if it has 1 tablespoon of molasses stirred in. TL;DR This is the best"
Looks like Amazon is selling old stuff. Kashi makes great Bars but just don't buy them from Amazon TL;DR Great stuff but bad quality
"This seller was prompt with delivery. I have noticed marked improvement in my knees since using this product. I have an allergy to shellfish,so using kosher gelatin is very important to me.I dissolve the gelatin in a little cold water as instructed,-then I stir it into my morning coffee.There isn't much change in taste,but if it bothers me on a particular day ,I just stir in a package of no added sugar cocoa. TL;DR HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT"
"First off,  let me state that I am not a fan of decaffeinated coffee of any type.  But I often have guests over who ask for de-caf, so I gave this a try.<br /><br />While I agree with some other reviewers who have stated that there is a certain ""different"" taste about this blend, for me, it was not a bitter taste, but instead, a good, strong flavor that mimicked the strong (real) coffee taste I enjoy.  I had a second cup, and the flavor grew on me even more, and I thought: ""it really is delicious for a decaf.""<br /><br />The aroma isn't truly satisfying (why does this always happen with decaf?) but I think many decaf drinkers will be used to that lack.<br /><br />The package had to be snipped open with scissors --this is tightly packed!-- and then I just poured it into a zip loc for storage in the fridge.<br /><br />I'll stick with regular coffee, but I'm sure my de-caf loving friends will enjoy this. TL;DR Delicious Decaffeinated"
We cannot hardly find this gum anymore in the stores so we tooka chance and ordered it online.  Very good choice to make. TL;DR same great taste
"Black tea is full of antioxidants, and green tea even more so. Very likely because many consumers consider green tea a bit on the bland side, Bigelow decided to blend it with their flavorful, delicious, 70-year-old, all-star tea, Constant Comment. This tea is a terrific way to start the day. Green tea energizes without causing the jitters.<br /><br />Highly recommended. TL;DR Delicious way to add green tea to your diet"
"I took one bite and found this cracker to be inedible. As a result, I threw out the whole box. Parents should not feed their kids this brand because they will never want to eat graham crackers if they think that they all taste like this! TL;DR Inedible"
"This was a good purchase. Tastes good, pretty colors.  Seems to go a long way.  I used at a family reunion with a bunch of kids and they raved about it.  I hope what was not used holds up for next year.  I put it away so as not to be tempted.  Very happy. TL;DR tastes good"
"So, normally I don't like ""Kona Blends"" because there's VERY little Kona taste. Here, that's not the case. You can REALLY taste the Kona in the Tully's Blend. I sent it to my parents when they first bought a keurig, and when I went to visit them, I couldn't stop drinking it. I was addicted to this coffee--I had to send them another box when I left because I depleated their supply. The BAD news is, I couldn't find this in non-keurig form (I don't have a Kuerig), which for me, is bad news indeed. :) I'll keep looking, though! TL;DR A little.. TOO good."
This is the soft and chewy type of jerky that is hard to find. I like it for back packing it come in a 6 pack and is just right for packing. Great value. TL;DR Soft jerky
These bags are great.  I gave them to my wife and she loves the convenience and the style.  They're great for our road trips.  What a brilliant idea. TL;DR My wife love these bags
"My husband and I are hazelnut coffee fans.  We've tried every brand of hazelnut K-cups we can find.  The Gloria Jean's is our favorite, even beating out Dunkin' Donut's and Millstone's Hazelnut Cream (which used to be my favorite) hands down.  We always make the largest size cup and there is still plenty of flavor, never watered down or ""thin"" tasting.  I've always been the major coffee drinker in the house, until we got the Keurig and then the Gloria Jean's Hazelnut.  My husband now drinks 2-4 cups a day!  Make the investment in the Keurig so much more worth it.<br /><br />This purchase is a great deal.  At $0.60 per cup and free shipping, it's a fabulous price and I don't feel like I'm paying extra money for packaging.  It does come in a no-frills box with all 50 of the cups just loose in the large box.  However, we have a holder on the counter which we fill and just keep the box in the pantry to pull from as we need.  If you have a storage situation like a stand or a drawer you keep your K-cups in, you'll have no complaints about them being loose in the box.  We're about to order our second box, and will definitely be repeat buyers! TL;DR Hazelnut Heaven"
"I purchased the Cosmic Tuna Flakes, which are Cat Treats.  While my cat loves the Tuna Flakes, it took over 3 weeks for the Cosmic Firm to ship out the product.  Go with the Cat-Man Doo Extra Large Tuna Flakes.  Also a better deal. TL;DR Cosmic Tuna Flakes Cat Treats"
"Absolutely delicious bars and at a great price!  Other reviewers noted the almonds aren't very plentiful, but that's fine for me. Very moist bars, and just the right amount of sweetness. Went through the box in about 2 weeks! TL;DR Delicious"
"Okay People, unless the picture gets changed from a group of flavors to just one, the picture is misleading.  Make sure you look at the title, they're only selling you orange!!!!!!!! TL;DR Wrong Picture"
"I haven't actually tasted the product yet, but you should be aware that it comes in a teeny, tiny package equaling about one tablespoon.  I'll admit I should have looked at the amount closer before I ordered!  But now YOU know. TL;DR Teeny, tiny amount"
"This candy is wonderful, and I will be re-ordering soon. I would encourage at the very least that if you have not ever had Marzipan this is a great time to try it. If you have had it  in the past, jump in and enjoy it again. TL;DR Sinfully good!"
"The rice arrived in a paper bag inside a cardboard box. There was no protection against moisture or occasional liquid spills on the bag during transit. They could have put a plastic cover over the paper bag. I dont know how it was stored in the warehouse it came from. I still went ahead and opened the packet as I had completely run out of rice and I eat rice atleast once a day. The rice had a mix of some other grain!! (I could not recognize what the grain was). I can say that grain accounted for maybe 4-5% of the total bag volume. I wouldnt mind if it was rice bran, better than having polished rice. On cooking the rice becomes real thick, not long grained. Smell on cooking is like normal rice, nothing like jasmine rice. Wont buy again. Would like to mention that shipping was fast. TL;DR wouldnt buy again"
"I bought 5 individual packages of different types of protein drinks to see which I liked before I committed with a whole container. This was excellent - I mixed it with orange juice and proceeded to play 1 1/2 hours of tennis - singles and not once did I feel hungry. I used a small hand-held frother to make sure it mixed completely so I wouldn't taste any of the unmixed granules. I've since ordered the ""whole container""... TL;DR Great energizer!!"
"We love this natural creamer!  I couldn't get my husband away from the creamers that tasted so sweet and are full of corn syrup, etc...but he will use this creamer.  It's not as creamy, yes, however, it does a great job...dissolves quickly, no bitter taste and no strange color.  It fits great into our organic life-style. TL;DR Love this!"
This is not orange and tangerine juice; it's mainly apple and grape juice flavored with orange and tangerine. And I really don't care about the vitamin C content; vitamin C is easy to get.<br /><br />What I do care about is that this is definitely the worst-tasting soda of any type that I have ever tried. I couldn't pour it down the drain fast enough. TL;DR Tastes like soap.
"I've bought Stonewall's grilling sauces for years, and always found them to be very tasty. My personal favorite happens to be the Pomegranate grill sauce. It's not one of the ones in this package, but quite tasty. I have no idea where the other poster got the ""watery"" aspect from, as I've always found their grilling sauces wonderfully thick. Anyway, my personal opinion is that they are great. TL;DR Like Their Products"
"We love granola and organic cereals in our house, and I have reviewed other types of cereals for Amazon before.  We have several boxes of Nature's Path cereals and granola in our pantry right now, but this one will not be kept in our rotation.  Let me start by saying that I appreciate the good-for-you ingredients that Nature's Path uses in their cereals.  They  are usually pretty low in fat, the sugar is not off the charts like most commercially prepared, highly sugared brands, and you can actually read the list of ingredient without finding lost of additives, preservatives, and just plain bad for you ingredients--they are spot on when it comes to that stuff.  The cereal ingredients read like a Who's Who List of great for you foods you should be eating.  It's just the taste of this cereal that has lead me to a less than stellar review.<br /><br />I tried some of the cereal before adding any milk to it, and my first thought was that the cereal had a very fake sugar smell to it.  The bigger puffs in the box reminded me of Cap'n Crunch and it was certainly not the taste I was going for.  When adding the milk, the cereal got soggy faster that I had hoped, and the flavor seemed non-descript.  I know the box says Vanilla Sunrise, but there was absolutely no hint of vanilla, and the after taste left me feeling like I ate some really fake cereal.  This is not what I am used to with Nature's Path products.<br /><br />I can highly recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006J4MAKY"">Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries 11.5-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>, a product I have already reviewed, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049D3YTS"">Nature's Path Organic Acai Apple Granola with Pomegranate, 11.5-Ounce Boxes, (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006SPAH6I"">Natures Path Pomegranate Plus Granola (1x25lb)</a>., but I can not recommend this cereal. TL;DR This Will Not Be Making It Into My Breakfast Rotation"
This coffee is great!  I have tried several types of their coffee and have yet to taste one that is not fantastic.  I actually like the coffee I make at home now better than Dunkin' Donuts or Starbucks coffee.  When I open the box the wonderful aroma never fails to coax me into making a pot right then.  You can't get more bang for your buck.  It is fabulous coffee and the cost is right. TL;DR The best coffee I have ever tasted!
"I am a sceptic so I always start anything as a doubter. The day after we started on Hemp hearts back Dec 1st 2010 , both hubby and I noticed we both had more energy and the brain fog lifted. We eat 4 tablespoons each n the mornings in yogurt or in smoothies. I sprinkle them on salads and add to most of my food.<br /><br />  Ok, our so I thought ""Heck if we feel better how bout giving them to our dogs!"" Our pug is 11 this summer. He was getting lethargic , lazy, and seemed like he was just kind of depressed. I thought it was just aging and do not want to loose him and see him like this. I add 1 teasp to each dogs food every day and their coats are shinier and have stopped shedding. The pugs eyes seem brighter and they both have more energy so the pug has lost some weight. I hope never to be without my Hemp hearts again as long as I live! I am on auto deliver and we eat 5 lbs a month.<br /><br /> Hemp hearts are God's perfect food! You could live on them and water alone if you had to! Stock up!<br /><br /> God bless us all! Eat more Hemp Hearts!<br />BeeTx TL;DR Will NEVER be without my Hemp Hearts!!"
"I love dried peaches and normally respect the SunMaid brand. As such, I thought these were a bargain ($12 for a 6-pack). Unfortunately, they have a pungent smell that is kind of funky and turns me off. They are edible, but I think I'll give away my 4 unopened packs to the local food bank rather than eating them. TL;DR Good price, but bad smell"
I love this tea whether my stomach is upset or not! I drink on cooler days just for the satisfaction! TL;DR Love this tea
"I was turned on to the Blue Buffalo brand by the trainer at the training class I signed me and my pup for.  He is my new little fur ball so I have been very cautious about what he eats and the type of foods that he is exposed to.  I really didn't want to get into the habit of buying cheap foods and treats with random fillers and terrible nutrition, so I was always open to advice from the ""experts"".  After doing some reading, I realized that Blue Buffalo is indeed one of the best most natural brands of Dog Foods available, so I jumped at the chance at trying these little treats for my in-training pup.  They are great! He absolutely loves them and will literally do anything for them!  He has already learned how to sit, lay, 'dance', 'paw', and stay!  The great thing is that they don't even smell terrible, they actually smell a bit like beef jerky.<br /><br />One thing I do recommend, is that if you have a smaller pup (mine is a shihpoo, 5months, 8lbs) cut these treats in half!  They are perfectly capable of eating them as a whole piece, but you totally get your money's worth by breaking them down in halves ;) TL;DR My Pup Absolutely Loves These"
"As a big fan of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies, both the original and the chewy, I was prepared to love these as well. But it was just a big glob of mushy chocolate, barely held together with a tiny bit of cookie. Now, like most people, I'm pretty enthusiastic about chocolate, and theoretically, there is simply no such thing as ""too much."" But it just didn't taste right here. I really wish there had been more cookie involved, to break up the taste a bit; maybe that would've helped. But whatever went wrong here, it definitely did.<br /><br />Overall, it was a rather disappointing experience. I won't be buying these anytime soon. TL;DR Nauseatingly chocolatey"
"Trident Layers is an excellent gum for chewing - even the texture is satisfying. I absolutely love the green apple flavor in general, but here it's even more delightful with the addition of subtle pineapple. One of my favorite things about Trident Layers is that each piece looks like candy - kind of like a licorice all sort. I find that chewing Trident Layers satisfies my cravings for candy! Pretty nice around 3-4 pm at work, when I'd like a snack. TL;DR One of my favorite gums EVER"
"The cereal is great.<br />I just can't find it in any local stores.<br />I have to order it online here on Amazon.<br />It is a little pricier, but the free super saver shipping is great! TL;DR Only place I can find this product"
"I love this Licorice Bridge Mix. I remember my Nana always having some of this around when I was little. I bought it to put in some Apothecary jars for decoration. I love the bright colors mixed with the pretty pastels and the black licorice jelly beans. My favorite pieces by far are the multi-colored sprinkle covered gum drops which I wish there were more of in the mix. Because there aren't very many of the gum drops, I place them around strategically to show them off better. This bridge mix also tastes good too. The little pastel pieces remind me Good and Plenty. Yum! TL;DR Pretty yummy eye candy"
"Pretty expensive, given how quickly my pets go through these, but they freakin LOVE them!!  So it's worth it once in a while. TL;DR Dogs and cats love them!"
"Pricey, but well worth it.  Best pickled sausages you will get anywhere I think.  Generous portions in this 2 jar deal as well.  I will be a life long customer as long as they don't screw with the price too much in the future. TL;DR Outstanding"
"This is a darned nice ginger snap. They're very dry and crisp (for snappiness), and have a good strong ginger flavor -- strong enough to give you a tingle on your tongue if you wolf down a handful of them one after the other, as I'm prone to do. They might be too strongly gingery for some kid's tastes, and better for the cookie-loving grownups in the family. TL;DR Gingery and snappy"
"I no longer need Mountain Dew..or 5hr energy! So The Price of Neuro Sonic, per bottle is a bit of a savings..I am A makeup Artist/Photoshoot Stylist, working looong hours! I also have Fibromyalgia, and I can Not tell you how much better I feel, since Drinking a bottle of Neuro Sonic a day..My Biggest Problem though? NOT finding it at any of the local 711's Or Many of the run in liquor stores..it Drives me Nuts..I feel Like a drug addict running from store to store looking for this stuff! also ..store owners told me that they had a hard time selling it because People dont like the taste..which I have heard also from friends..BUT..I LOVE IT! It does the Job, and it seems to be good for you! Thats the bottom Line for me:) TL;DR Imposible to find!!"
The Timothy's is a very mild but good tasting smooth coffee.  I wouldn't say it is my go to coffee (Donut House seems to be that one) but I do enjoy a cup of Timothy's now and again. TL;DR Mild but Tastes Good
"Of the many sweet & salty granola bars there is one for everyones taste,and from a quick snack to a trail meal that keeps you on the go it is perfect. TL;DR Nature Valley"
"This is my second time purchasing cacao powder, and I decided to go with Tisano. The biggest difference I noticed was this actually smelled like raw cocoa unlike the other brand which smelled heavily of fermentation. The taste was delicious in my smoothies after I got the portions correct. From what I can tell this is a very solid product.<br /><br />Hopefully they can continue to offer Prime shipping in the future. TL;DR Better than the rest"
"I dehydrate many types of peppers and then use a coffee grinder to make a powder out of them.  I was expecting to be able to do that with these peppers, but they are not dry enough for that.  They are closer in texture to the dried apricots you buy to eat out of hand.  Sort of leathery and pliant.<br /><br />Not a big problem, as I just plopped them on the dehydrator for a day until they were brittle/rock hard, and then ground them up.  As a precaution, I set the dehydrator outside on the deck to avoid the fumes.  They smell incredible -- a lot like chipotle peppers, actually.  I tasted just a tiny bit of some of the outer skin, and it was quite hot.  I'm sure with the seeds and veins included when ground, it's going to be flaming.<br /><br />There is a fair amount of rope fibers mixed in with the peppers, but I didn't mind this, as it reminded me that these were dried the old fashioned way - by tying and hanging them up.  It just took a little time to pull these threads off as I was placing them on the dehydrator trays.  I probably could have not bothered with that and just ground up the fibers with the peppers.<br /><br />I'll add to this review when I find out exactly how much ""one pound"" of these peppers actually weighs when properly dried. TL;DR Not quite ""dried"" peppers..."
"YES ONE COOKIE IS ALL YOU NEED, AND THE KIDS LIKE THEM TOO. SWEET AND FILLING.  MUCH MORE APPETIZING and SATISFYING THAN FAKE COOKIES (i.e. ahoy) TL;DR GUILT FREE!"
"To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.  It made me afraid to try other WP coffees but I did like the WP Sumatra Kopi Raya.<br /><br />For reference purposes my in store drink is a Starbucks Americano.<br /><br />My favorite k-cups are:<br />Starbucks French Roast<br />Starbucks Caffe Verona<br />Starbucks Pike Place Roast<br />Green Mountain Xtra Bold Sumatran Reserve<br />Green Mountain Double Black Diamond<br />Green Mountain Revv<br />Green Mountain Dark Magic<br /><br />Other k-cups I've tried:  Coffee People Jet Fuel ,Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf, Emeril Jazzed up Decaf, Starbucks Caffe Verona, Coffee People Black Tiger,  Starbucks House Blend, Starbucks Breakfast Blend, Starbucks Sumatra, Wolfgang Puck French Roast, Green Mountain Lake and Lodge, Green Mountain French Roast, Caribou Mahogony, Wolfgang Puck Sumatra Kopi Raya, Emeril Big Easy Bold TL;DR bitter"
Golden Malted Waffle mix is the best on the market for making waffles.  I give it as a gift whenever I hear a friend or family member is looking for a good mix.  They all rave about the flavor. TL;DR best waffle mix
"My husband loves this brand of gummy bears, so I was excited when I found a 5lb bag available! They came very fresh, and did not have a chance to get stale because they were gone within weeks! TL;DR The BEST Gummy Bears"
"Ordered malossol salmon caviar, received some orange mess in a regular green tin. Brave soul that I am - I have actually tried this nonsense. It does not come even close to resembling what a fresh, properly handled caviar should taste like. If I am still alive in 2 hours I guess you can call it ""edible"". TL;DR Nope"
This product was very strange. It says it is a plant root but why the fish smell? It was extremely difficult to chew through so some went down my throat whole. If you wake up at 1am feeling nauseous don't be surprised. I did not like this product. TL;DR Tough to chew
These are amazing candies.  Great for gifts as well as for treats (if you can bear to give them away). TL;DR cost but well worth it
"Today makes it over a month, still my friend haven't got there gift from me. What was the plant I paid for TL;DR Plant never showed up"
"I just bought the cola flavor from Amazon and it tastes pretty good. It is different from regular coke, but not so different that I won't drink it again.  What I like about this is I get a healthier option for soda without the bad aftertaste of diet soda.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because nothing will ever beat regular Coca-Cola when it comes to cola flavored soda. But I don't like all the sugar that's in Coke.<br />The only downside right now is the price.  You are paying roughly $1.13 a can, but if you don't guzzle the stuff then it won't matter.  I do plan to buy some of the other flavors. TL;DR Not bad for a soda"
"I find this a much better choice than the other non-water drinks out there. I can't always get my hands on the fruits and other foods that give the antioxidants I like to get, and this is an easy and tasty way to get them. Great stuff, I always try to keep some stocked. TL;DR A great alternative"
"I am so happy from the day I started using this product as the whole family is enjoying drinking water kefir everyday, they love the taste and most important for us is to feel healthy..... TL;DR Very good product"
"I have been breastfeeding since birth, she is 11mo now & we began supplementing with 1 nite nite bottle per night at 6 mo old so we can get a little bit of sleep since we both work full time. (yep, pumping ALOT at work too, Medela in style double electric is a great pump!) She likes this this formula, no tummy issues or constipation for our little one so yes, I recommend this! TL;DR Ours loves it!"
"I'm disappointed in this product.  One review of it I read before purchasing it, said it was so much better than the cheaper hot chocolate mixes available; I disagree.  It is good, but not great, and I hate that it blends poorly, be prepared for lumpy drink. TL;DR Wish it blended better."
Last 3 years I am using this tea; it is the finest tea in the world. Subscribing makes it cost effective. TL;DR The finest tea in the world
"I was worried that I would not like this because I wasn't sure what ""plantains"" are - they are just raisins made from white grapes. It's a fantastic oatmeal - far above any of the ""Instant"" varieties.  It takes me about 5 minutes to prepare in the microwave, but I don't need to add additional fruit or sweetener.  It's perfect exactly like it is from the bag.  Beware though, directions for a ""serving"" make a BIG serving.  About 1/2 of their serving is what I'm accustomed to eating at once. TL;DR Excellent Oatmeal!"
"This is a great bread!  Great taste, great texture, lots of raisins. YUMMY.Turns out wonderful each time.  I don't think you will be sorry.  Try it! TL;DR One of my favorites!"
"Once again, in an effort to appease my hippy lady friend I tried some ""all-natural"" crap since my Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper didn't have enough natural ingredients.  She convinced me to buy a 24-pack of Switch Watermelon Strawberry soda, which cost me more than 5x as much money as my non-eco and non-zen-friendly Code Red.  I've purchased 24-packs of Budweiser that were cheaper and they came in 12-oz cans and not this dinky 9oz.<br /><br />And then there's the size issue.  Now, I'm told size doesn't matter (although, I'm convinced she lied) but I do feel like I'm coming up short when I'm faced with a 9oz as opposed to a regular 12oz.  This is especially true given the price.  It also fails to recognize my manhood, such as it is, when I'm grasping a can smaller than a Red Bull and it doesn't even give me wings.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed, when I opened the can, was the pleasant aroma remiscent of... Old Orchard?  I cracked open the first one while driving in my truck and my good buddy Drewfus sitting next to me took a sniff, looked over and asked, ""is that a soda or are you drinking apple juice?""  The scent was that pungent.<br /><br />As if to add insult to injury, I took my first swig.  The first thing I noticed was the high sugar content almost akin to a Monster drink.  To confirm this, I later examined the can (before properly disposing it at the shooting range) to discover Switch had more sugar than a regular coke and nearly as much as Dr. Pepper.  This is insane as it has more sugar content than an already sugar-filled drink that has three more ounces on it.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed in the taste was a very familiar element.  Almost as if I had tasted this before during my sober days.  Later, I found myself drinking a generic Shasta kiwi-strawberry soda I obtained from the local grocery store (Western Family equivilent for West Coast and Sam's for you Wal-Mart shoppers) and then it hit me, it tasted just like Switch.  I quickly grabbed another Switch can and compared; the tastes were nearly identical.<br /><br />So, what can I possibly get out of spending as much money for a 24-pack as I would for a Blu-Ray DVD that tastes like a generic?  Maybe feel greener since I drank something that I think came from environmentally friendly alluminum similar to environmentally friendly acid from hybrid car batteries.  It still tasted nice, but I felt seriously ripped off given the price.  I certainly was motivated to get more Busch Light since I seem to get more bang for my buck that way, which says A LOT. TL;DR Costs Like an Organic, Tastes Like a Generic (Another Redneck Perspective)"
"My daughter has been on Nutramigen Lipil for about 5 months now for her acid reflux.  It has really helped with her spitting up and digesting the food quicker.  Since the stores in our area decided to discontinue carrying this type of formula and started stocking the Nutramigen with Enflora, I've had to switch over to using that instead.<br />For one thing, it is much more expensive.  It's a 12.6 oz can instead of a 16 oz. can.  The scoop inside is much larger so you are using more formula per bottle.  They say the reason for the scoop being larger is that the formula is less dense.  In any case, it is still costing you more money (as if it wasn't expensive enough already.)<br />In our case, our daughter is now suffering very painful gas pains, especially in the middle of the night, since we've started using this new type of formula.  She is also pooping much more frequently during the day. Before she would go about once a day, now it's about 4 times a day.<br />I've called Enfamil to see how I could obtain the original formula and they looked up their past orders to see who in my area has ordered it recently.  All the names they gave me were stores I am familiar with and have personally checked to see if they stocked it, which they do not.  Fortunately, I found a case of it here on Amazon for much cheaper then they (Enfamil) or any grocery store could ever offer.<br />I'm not sure why they felt it necessary to add Enflora to this formula if for no other reason than to make even more money.<br />I strongly recommend that if you are going to start your child on Nutramigen, to get the formula that does NOT contain Enflora.  Check with your pediatrician first to see if they have any free samples they can give you.  I am eagerly awaiting my case of Nutramigen Lipil so that I can once again enjoy a full night of sleep without waking up to my baby crying out in pain. TL;DR More expensive for less formula, gave my baby very painful gas"
"I had heard of this tea from watching Dr. Oz. Picked up a recent Woman's World magazine and they had a recipe for an iced tea with Pu Erh, White Tea, ginger, and lemon juice. The combination tastes great. I drink coffee black and found I had no need for sweeteners in this tea combo. I am on day 2 of drinking this and found it does suppress appetite and gives me as good, if not better, revving than coffee. So far, I'm happy with this tea. I haven't tried drinking it by itself, though. TL;DR Pu Erh - Dr. Oz Recommended"
"We have three cats in the household, and they all LOVE these treats - in all flavors.  In fact, we rattle the bag to get the kitties to come in at night - almost always works.  One cat is fussy and won't eat any treats but these.<br /><br />I'm not sure how ""good"" the treats are for their health - the package says ""nutritionally complete and balanced"", and the ingredients include taurine which is essential for cats.  I suspect a diet including kibble, ""wet"" food and occasional treats is ideal. TL;DR M&Ms for cats"
"I usually find these at my local health food store.  It's a great, tasty product, which I think most people would enjoy.<br /><br />They are great for entertaining when you have family over or friends. TL;DR Excellent Product"
I bought these for my daughter as a starter food.  She loved it for the first thirty seconds before she broke off a piece and started choking on it.  I would not recomend this for children until they are fully on solid foods. TL;DR Dangerous!!!
"I'd encountered these before, when ordering ca phe sua da (Vietnamese iced coffee) at better pho-houses, and I decided to pick one up as a possible single-cup coffee solution (the coffee at my office is hideous, and I prefer to make my own).  Having only had coffee brewed in this sort of filter in the aforementioned situation, I really didn't have an opinion on the quality of the brew (sweetened condensed milk will cover a lot of sins).  After a few tries to get the brewing procedure down just right, I can say this makes one of the best cups of black coffee I've ever had.  The brew is somewhat between that of a French press and a standard drip filter; it's as strong as a strong pot of French press, and as aromatic, but has the more balanced flavor profile of a well-brewed cup of drip coffee.  I've only had the chance to use middle-of-the-line grocery store beans in the thing, but I'm looking forward to brewing up some top-end coffee in this; with the well-balanced extraction it offers, I expect it to be a treat.<br /><br />Clean-up is a breeze, limited moving parts and the grounds rinse right off, much quicker than fine-mesh filter cones or french press.  I picked up two, one for work and one for home, and I have a feeling they will both get plenty of use. TL;DR Great cup of coffee"
"I have an Australian Cattle Dog mix who is a year and a half old and a very heavy chewer.  She DESTROYS most toys.  I found this bone on sale at Target and decided to give it a try.  She had the Nylabone puppy key teether and enjoyed those.  I was surprised how hard this bone is - like a rock - but she LOVES LOVES LOVES it!  It sounds awful while she chews it and I constantly worry that she's going to crack or break a tooth while chewing.  I know it's supposed to help clean their teeth and gums, but I noticed that it ripped up the roof of her mouth pretty bad after a long chewing session - to the point where parts of the ridges on the top of her mouth were completely gone.<br /><br />I might try to see if I can find slightly softer bones of this nature for her to chew on - just for my own sanity.  I'd hate to think she could damage her mouth or ruin her teeth on this toy.  She gives this bone 5 stars, I give it 3 - so we're averaging a 4. TL;DR My dog loves it, but it makes me nervous"
"These chocolate covered espresso beans are wonderful!  The chocolate is very dark and rich and the ""bean"" inside is a very delightful blend of flavors with just enough caffine to really give it a zing. TL;DR These are the Best!"
"we purchased this cuz our lil buddy has stinky breath.  i saw the reviews that mentioned the gagging and just hoped it wouldn't affect our dog.  unfortunately, i was wrong.  he gagged on some, others he didn't, we kept giving em a try and following some of the advice others have here - unfortunately, he even threw up once or twice.  after that we just threw them away. TL;DR gag, hack, throw up, throw away"
This is a mixture of half coffee and half hot chocolate and it is delicious.  I often have one in the afternoon for a treat! TL;DR Yummm
THese dried cranberries are wonderfully fresh and tasty.  I like to keep them on had for cereal and salads or for just having a handful. TL;DR LOVE these dried cranberries.
"DUBBLE BUBBLE IS JUST THE BEST OF THE BEST IN BUBBLE GUMS. IVE TRIED THEM ALL, HOWEVER, I ALWAYS COME BACK TO DUBBLE BUBBLE TL;DR WORLDS BEST BUBBLE GUM"
"GoPicnic's Ready to Eat Meals with Salmon and Crackers was an interesting array of mostly healthy foodstuffs.  The whole shebang comes in a cardboard box that opens like a laptop and can presumably be closed again (I ate everything and so didn't close it).  There's even a sudoku puzzle on the inside(of mine at least). Also inside are individually wrapped containers of Late July brand rich crackers, Seapoint Farms Dry Roasted Edamame with salt, Gopicnic's Chili Lime Salmon spread, Gopicnic's Ginger Zip fruit and nut mix, and a Terra Nostra's organic robust dark chocolate square.  These items are all shelf stable for several months as long as kept in a cool dry place (meaning that you probably shouldn't store these in your car in the summertime for more than a few hours).<br /><br />I have a love hate relationship with salmon.  Either I love it (usually in the form of spreads and cakes) or I hate it (grilled, broiled, pan fried filets) so I expected to love this version.  Surprisingly, I'm kind of on the fence about this very orange appearing spread.  It has a nice salmon flavor (and large flakes of fish in the mix) that is just slightly fishy and you can taste the lime, but to me the chili was really lacking.  I think with more of a chili note in the spread I would have enjoyed it much more. 3 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Salmon Spread Ingredients:Alaskan pink salmon, water, red pepper paste, sugar, lime juice, modified cornstarch, salt, vinegar, garlic powder, chili powder, spices (no MSG), natural lime flavor, maltodextrin, and natural color.  The salmon comes from a MSC certified fishery.<br /><br />The Late July Crackers (which I have had before) are always delicious and remind me much of a flaky butter type cracker.  The salmon spread went well on them and they weren't brittle enough to break when the spread was applied.  The utensil given for this purpose was a fork. 6 Crackers come in a pack and I found that I had a little more salmon than cracker (although I didn't go crazy with the application. 5 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Cracker Ingredients: Organic Wheat flour, organic evaporated cane juice, organic oleic safflower oil and/or organic oleic sunflower oil, organic palm oil, sea salt, leavening, soy lecithin, enzymes.<br /><br />I didn't really like the Dry Roasted Edamame.  The only taste at all that I got from them was the bare hint of salt added.  I think with all the other flavor packed items in this picnic a seasoned variety could have better competed with everything.  Otherwise it was somewhat bland and I had no desire to finish the small packet. 1 Star for this product<br /><br />Edamame Ingredients:Soybeans, Sea Salt<br /><br />I think my favorite item in this packet would be the Ginger Zip fruit mix.  It was tasty, but not too sweet, with just the lightest touch of ginger that I thought was perfect and didn't overpower the natural flavors of the dried fruit and peanut mixture.  Sadly, it was only a .75 oz packet and I ran out before I wanted to.  I would gladly have traded the edamame for a bigger packet of this snack. 5 Stars for this product<br /><br />Mix Ingredients:Ginger peanuts, (sugar, ground ginger, sea salt), cranberries, banana chips.<br /><br />Last but not least is the dark chocolate square.  I'm a big fan of dark chocolate and since this was 60% cacao it suited me just fine.  It had just a hint of sweetness with that wonderful bitterness you can only get from darker chocolates. 4 Stars for this product.<br /><br />Chocolate Ingredients:Organic dark chocolate, dry cocoa solids.<br /><br />Allergies: On all items the packaging warns for Soy, Milk, Wheat, Peanuts, Fish, and Treenuts.<br /><br />Overall I'd have to say that this was a pretty good snack that I could see myself taking to work or on a car trip with me. I'd prefer that a couple of the ingredients would change but it still filled me up despite my avoidance of some items, but didn't over fill me to the point where I felt sleepy after lunch.<br /><br />Review by M.

"I got this for my boston terrier, he seems to love it!  He chased it around the house, pushing it along the floor, for a couple hours straight.<br /><br />Edit: it is now his favorite toy! TL;DR Good dog toy"
"I chew a ton of gum, and this 4 'tub' value pack is great. It tastes just as good as the smaller packs (so make sure you enjoy this flavor before buying 4 tubs!).<br /><br />My only issue is that the pieces looked a bit...rough. Like the corners were a bit chipped off, maybe from rattling around in these tubs. Really, not a big deal - but the ones that come in the standard packs seem to be glossier and more attractive. Just saying :) TL;DR Great!"
"These are just like I used to buy in the store, if you like grapefruit flavor you must try.  Excellent TL;DR excellent candy!!!!"
"It's a little expensive, but more than worth it, and it ships for free.<br />I love this salsa and I'm sooooooo glad I can get it from Amazon.<br />Thanks Amazon!!! TL;DR Loved it!"
"We used these at my sister in laws bridal shower as part of her 'candy bar' and these were gone extremely fast. They are soooo good, I would buy them again but then I would just be sitting on my couch eating them all in one sitting... so I will only be buying them for parties ;) The colors of the bridal shower were a 'tiffany blue' which is why I went for this particular color, and these were perfect not just for the amazing taste but also because these are a perfect tiffany blue. Loved them! TL;DR DELICIOUS!"
I purchase this for home use.  it is extremely convenient.  no need for refrigeration.  only 3  creamers had leaked bit.  I use two creamers for a cup of coffee.  The package arrived before due date. TL;DR I love this creamer
"I love finding American small family farmers doing the right thing and finding a market for their small production on this amazing resource called Amazon.  Nice personal note comes with the beans and lentils, thanking me for patronizing their operation. TL;DR support American small farmers doing the right thing"
Haven't ordered yet. I need to know exactly what I'm buying.<br /><br />Dose each box have 8 packages.<br /><br />I'm looking for the best deal. So what am I getting when I purchase one box.<br /><br />Harry TL;DR How many boxes?
"GOOD PRODUCT  USE FOR TEETH, ANTIBIOTIC  CAN USE FOR SKIN, HAIR<br />DIDN'T WORK WELL FOR COLD I HAD, IN FACT HARD ON EMPTY STOMACH TL;DR HI"
"I have feed my toddler these raviolis since 1 years old.  She loves them!  I cut them in half and she feeds herself.  I feed her exclusively organic food, and this makes a great variation in her meals. TL;DR Healthy Food for Babies and Toddlers"
Good quality product.  I have ulcers and this tea seems to calm my stomach!  Will order from them again!! TL;DR Good tea
"Well, I was sitting there studying and suddenly I had a craving for sour candy. Since my roommate wouldn't share his, I figured I'd go to Amazon and this is what I ended up picking.<br /><br />These worms are great. It's a little on the sour side compared to the sweet side, but it's a good limiter that helps you stop when you've eaten enough.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was that the different colors are actually different flavors. Blue is raspberry, red is cherry, yellow is lemon--well alright this might be par for the course, but prior to eating these I hadn't had sour gummy candy in over two years. It was a nice surprise to see these worms actually had flavor (a bit too much lemon though)<br /><br />It's a lot of worms. I leave the bag open, which I probably shouldn't, but I only notice them getting a little tougher (actually kinda nice), with no drop in quality.<br /><br />Basically, you'll get exactly what you think you'll get. And it'll be nice. TL;DR Satisfied my craving"
"These garlic cloves are amazing! I snack on them right out of the jar! I think nothing of ordering it by the case and having it sent way over here to the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i. Yes, it's that good! If you love garlic...or even if you don't check out these little morsels of white gold. You won't be sorry! TL;DR Yum to the 10th degree!"
"I was leery of purchasing a Cliff bar for kids because I personally find the adult bars to be disgusting, from the texture to the taste.  But we received a sample of the chocolate chip bar... the kidlet enjoyed the taste, and mom enjoyed the ingredient list and packaging.  So I bought the multi-pack in an attempt to encourage breakfast eating.  She hated the graham cracker one, which is the one I liked the best.  She loved the chocolate brownie and chocolate chip the best.  I am not generally a fan of processed foods, but am impressed at the way ZBars minimize the processing and undesirable ingredients.<br /><br />She now eats breakfast without a fight so these have become an emergency snack I keep in my purse.  If you have to have something packaged, be it for lunches, road trip, or errands, I recommend these over any other kids' bar on the market. TL;DR So much tastier than the adult bars"
"Some of the chocolate pieces had a crystalization on the sides or bottoms.  YOu can eat around that, but still dissapointing a bit. TL;DR Some pieces messed up"
I bought this thinking I would be able to eat spicy foods like no problem.  These things take about 20 minutes to kick in and then it just makes stuff taste sweet WHERE THE TABLET TOUCHES YOUR TONGUE.  If you miss a spot on your tongue then you will still taste it in that spot. DISLIKE A LOT!!! TL;DR DOES NOT WORK WELL
This Go Raw chocolate is awesome.  Taste is great and low fat to boot.  Highly recommend this product and all Go Raw products! TL;DR delish and healthy
Very tasty product...and low fat and natural. I have tried most of their flavors and like them all. Will buy again. TL;DR Tasty
"I'm not a vegetarian but I've been eating Bac-Os for years. While it's very true that they don't taste exactly like bacon, they don't really have to because they taste pretty good themselves. They were originally marketed as a salad topping, in place of bacon bits if you like, and then found to be tasty on many other things. I like them on/in baked potatoes, pancakes, eggs, and just about anywhere else I want some little crunchy smokey&salty flavored treats. They are a hell of a lot more conventient than bacon, and cheaper than bacon bits in a jar. Probably safer too, as I'm not too sure how long real bacon bits are good for even covered in salt and in a jar.<br /><br />Anyway, Bac-Os have always been very good for what they are and I'm glad that Betty Crocker still makes them.<br /><br />Amazon does indeed sell things that are close to their expiration date but I don't think it matters with this one. TL;DR A Very Good Bacon Replacement (Vegetarian)"
"Love this coffee! It has nice, not overpowering aroma. Coffee tastes fresh, no bitter after taste. Going to reorder it now, since the taste and price both are satisfying to my taste TL;DR Love it!"
"Not what I was expecting. I bought this tree a week ago for a welcoming home gift for my wife. When I received the tree in the mail, I was very disappointed with the size of the tree. The tree had one sprig of green about the size of a plum. The pot and the tree looked nothing like the picture. I had to run out to another bonsai tree store 2 hours away to fix this problem. TL;DR Very Disappointed"
"We first tried this root beer (Saranac) when we were visiting our daughter in Rome, NY. Since then, that root beer is the only kind we like.  Whenever we go up there (from Florida) we buy a couple of cases. I wish we could find it down here, but we can't. I am so glad I found this on amazon.com!  Five stars, for sure! TL;DR Diet root beer"
"Over the years we have tried fruit clubs from several different vendors.  Golden State is the best value for the money, hands down.  Fruit is ALWAYS of outstanding quality - superior to what can be purchased in the grocery store or even at the farmer's market.  Just bursting with juice and flavor.  Delivery has ALWAYS arrived timely and in excellent condition.  Fruit arrives either ripe and ready for immediate eating or just days away from being so.  Along with the fruit the company provides some information about the fruit and suggested recipes, as well as tips on how to keep the fruit in its prime condition so it can be enjoyed over several days' time.  Take it from someone who has tried three or four other vendors - Golden State is the best overall product, especially for the price! TL;DR Excellent Quality - Best Fruit Club Available"
"When our cat was sick with no appetite for solids, she had no problem drinking some Catsure here and there throughout the day. TL;DR Cats Enjoy the Taste. Good Nutrition for Those Who Can't Eat."
"I have been using this product for several months on an over weight, spayed, eight year old female Dalmatian. This dog has been ravenously hungry her whole life and constantly begged for food and stole food when given the oppotunity. Because of that, keeping her weight in check has been a battle. We even went so far as to have health screens done to make sure this wasn't a thyroid or other issue. I decided to try Lean Dog to see if maybe it would help with her appetite. I am pleased to say that it has been like a miracle for her. It has definitly taken the egde off of her appetite. She has dropped weight, her coat looks great and she just appears younger and happier. I like that the product has all natural ingredients and is not filled with drugs. I highly recommend this product for others to try. TL;DR Very Pleased"
"There were a TON of candies in the package, so it's definitely worth buying for more than one person. If you love black licorice and caramel, you will not be disappointed. The package came and the candies were very fresh. I would buy this again. TL;DR love black licorice and caramel?"
"The groats are supplied in a nitrogen filled ""tin can"" that is rated to last 5years.  The poly lid works well after the can is opened.<br /><br />The quality of the groats is good. Only a few black groats have to be removed and that is because I make cereal with them instead of the recommended (traditional?) sprouts.  Buy them, you will like them.  The few blacks grouts are easy to remove. TL;DR It works"
"I bought this because my legs and ankles had been swollen badly for over a week and this is not normal for me.  Dandelion leaf tea is supposed to be a diuretic, but I've been drinking it for a couple days and there is no difference that I can tell.<br /><br />When steeped for 12 minutes per the directions for medicinal use the flavor is very ""grassy"" and rather bitter.  I expected the bitter part from the dandelion leaves, but the grassy flavor is a bit hard to take unless I mix it with other teas, drinking twice as much to get the proper dosage of the dandelion.  I tried adding a little bit of honey in the straight tea to cut the grassy taste but I wound up with too sweet plus bitter.<br /><br />I then bought a couple bunches of fresh parsley and made tea from it.  Cost:  around $2 for enough tea for almost two weeks.  However, you won't need to drink parsley tea for more than 2 days at most to have all that excess fluid removed from your body.  It works:  It's cheap; It's natural, and no paper bags to dispose of! One note:  Parsley tea doesn't taste all that great either but you can add other kinds of tea to help the flavor.<br /><br />Save your money... go to your local grocery store and get the parsley. TL;DR Isn't working like I thought it would"
"My family has allergies and ADD and we are trying to eliminate those triggers from our diet.<br /><br />I tried FIT, and could not believe how much junk was left in the bowl after rinsing!!!  I have searched for alternative products and methods for over 15 years - and there is no comparison.<br /><br />I have even read reports that plain water with a drop of Palmolive Dish washing liquid will clean just as well.  No way.  All you have to do to prove this is the best way to clean your fresh food is try this simple test:<br /><br />Pick grapes off the vine and drop them into the colander which is sitting in its bowl.  I find you can get a lot more miles out of the pouring bottle if instead of using a cap full as it recommends, if you use the sprayer bottle and give the grapes a couple of good sprays as you roll the grapes around. I only use the pouring bottle to refill my sprayer bottle since I learned this trick.  Now, whirl your fingers through the grapes until all the sides are coated and the dirt has had a chance to loosen, about 10 seconds.  Then with the FIT coated grapes still there, fill the colander with water as if you were going to wash them the recommended way except you will not use a cupful of FIT.<br /><br />Now you can really swish them around easily for about 45 seconds and you be be amazed at what you see in the water.  Pick the basket of grapes out of the colander and dump the yucky water.  Now rinse away the film on your grapes and you will be surprised by the color that appears.  The grapes will feel smooth, their natural powdery bloom is gone as well as the Pesticides, and the toxic anti-mold preservatives they are dusted with. They have a darker richer color not a coated look. Pop one in your mouth.  ALL YOU TASTE IS GRAPES - nothing else.  And it is amazing how good grapes can taste!!<br /><br />I use this same method with green beans and frozen blueberries which also have high levels of toxins on them.  For the green beans, I cut the ends and then cut them into 2"" pieces.  That makes them swirl better in the bowl.  For Frozen blueberries, I am a little gentler so as to not damage them.  But DH eats them every morning - so the HAVE to be clean.<br /><br />We eat an apple a day in our family and I spray them and really massage them for a good 30 seconds.  Then rinse and wipe with a paper towel.  I tell you, I can NOT eat fruit and vegetables that have not been washed in FIT because their flavor is disgusting now that I know what clean produce tastes like.<br /><br />By using my spray and wash method, your FIT will last a good long time.  I use it at least 4-5 times a day and the 8 oz. spray bottle will go over 4 months before I need to refill it.<br /><br />BTW, you don't need to buy this kit.  You can buy just the sprayer and the larger refill bottle.  Any drainer which fits in a larger bowl will do just fine.<br /><br />I am sure this product will pay for itself health wise and in eating enjoyment. TL;DR Finally, the TASTE of Fresh Fruit, not the Waxes, Pesticides, Dirt and Bug & Bird Do !!!!"
"I have not found a bad ""Keurig"" coffee version yet.  This one included. Since receiving my machine I have been to Starbucks..maybe twice since the beginning of January.  I used to go 5X a week.  My husband is LOVING this gift, Starbucks is not.<br />Enjoy!! TL;DR Medium..smooth"
"I thought these cookies were awful - I couldn't even eat them, they went to the squirrels. After reading all the other reviews I was very disappointed. It seems like they were overbaked, but even if not they weren't even close to some other healthy cc cookies I buy, such as  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHLS8W"">Kashi TLC Cookies, Oatmeal Dark Chocolate, 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> TL;DR Very disappointed"
"use to buy this stuff all the time at walmart, but they don't sell it anymore. Thank god I found it on amazon. Love this stuff!!!! TL;DR The best"
"I used to drink Twinings India Spice Chai in the gold box daily and with great pleasure. It was so much better than Tazo (all ginger and vanilla) and the other supermarket brands (all cinnamon). Before I found it on Amazon I could only get it at the CostPlus/World Market, but happily made the trip. It was often sold out but STILL worth trying for.<br /><br />Then Twinings decided to change their recipe. I think in an attempt to taste more like Tazo, they took out all the subtle masala chai flavors and just dumped in a ridiculous amount of cardamom. It's literally enough to make your tongue a little numb and kills all the background flavors.<br /><br />The positive thing I can say is that it's still super cheap and convenient on Amazon Subscribe. And if you don't care about subtleties in flavor, the overload of cardamom eventually seems to kill those taste buds and it becomes less oppressive over time.  Not good, but less horrible.<br /><br />What was once a wonderful and satisfying tea experience now just gets the job done, but at the expense of all the joy :( TL;DR WAY too much cardamom!"
"I love sweet tea and used to use that southern brand that is advertised as the best tea, but, trying to save money, I found this JFG brand and will continue to use this as I think it is as good as that major brand but lots cheaper and is delivered right to my door! You can't beat that! TL;DR Replaces major brand for use as Sweet Tea!"
"I absolutely love this Cat Butt Gum.  When I chew it I instantly feel warm and fuzzy!  At first I was a litte reluctant to try it because of the name but after opening the box and trying a piece out, I realized that I love the taste and smell of Cat Butt.  The cute box is just a plus! TL;DR Cat Butt is Delicious!"
"I had the privilege to visit the town of Cetara on the Amalfi Coast, and actually bought some of these anchovies in person. I am thrilled that Amazon sells them, because otherwise I might have cried when my first jar ran out. This is an area of the world known for its anchovies, and these are the cream of the crop. TL;DR The best anchovies in the world!"
"We use this Latin seasoning to mix with lean ground beef, etc. using the recipe on the package and serve in a roll like a sloppy joe. Sprinkle on a little cheese......delish! We also love it added to a beef stew. I could no longer find this product locally so I started ordering it through Amazon. Can't be without it. I haven't tried the other Nueva Cocina products yet, but I plan to. TL;DR Seasoning is the best ever"
"I didn't think this would be very hot and it isn't.  It's a nice sauce for tacos or as a dip, very creamy. TL;DR Creamy"
"I received a custom open package with green tape all over, tea bags where opened and ripped apart, the box was cut open all around,I can send as many pictures as required..... but the worse part is that with it , I got a Custom, DEA and FDA warning letters that the coca tea box was getting in the United States WITHOUT licences for schedule II substances from a no registered seller for what it was a 100% illegal package from Bolivia that I needed to sign for and get my name registered as importer of ILEGAL GOODS, and the product was not intended for human consumptions because it was not from a FDA certified location. Check the sellers feedback, I am not the only one complaining!!!<br />How is possible that Amazon can aloud sellers without licencing for controlled substances and food in its pages??? I called the other seller whom also sells coca tea at Amazon ""Bolivia Stores"" and found out that they are an American company with all paperwork, licences and permissions while this is a different seller from Bolivia not linked to them in any way.<br />I presented a claim to Amazon today with all the detail<br /><br />I want my money back, I receive a product that cannot be used and I will contact my credit card company with the complain also but now, who fix the problem I have with Customs US??? TL;DR BE AWARE , ILEGAL PRODUCT"
"I know that's an odd thing to say, but I was hoping for a thin dark chocolate shell around one of the excellent Mauna Loa macadamia nuts.<br />What I received was a very thick, middle of the road dark chocolate, sometimes wrapped around a half or whole macadamia that was not up to the standards that Mauna Loa usually presents.<br /><br />These are larger than a quarter in diameter.<br /><br />I wont buy them again TL;DR Too much chocolate"
The best powder!  Does not contain any aluminum which is important to me.....don't want to feed my family any!! TL;DR Baking
"These cookies are a great quick snack for the kids. They did not even complain about the raisins, I think they gobble them up before they even notice! TL;DR My kids love these raisins and all!"
"When we first got out new belgian waffle maker, we made a few throw-away batches to break it in and then made our first true made-to-eat waffle using the store bought Aunt Jamima and it tasted OK.  The next day my partner used the Golden Malted Pancake mix (which is actually healthier according to nutirition label) and it tasted 10X as good as the other.  In fact, just as good as any restuarant or hotel I've partaken at.  Keep in mind, I'm more of a bacon and eggs person, and now I can't wait to eat a waffles. TL;DR Tastes Ummm good!"
These candies are just as good as they were when I was a child and bought them for a treat.  Highly recommended. TL;DR Ice Cube Chocolates
"This fruit leather is made from 100% fruit (actually, it does have ""natural strawberry flavor"") and tastes great! Of the flavors I've tried, strawberry is my favorite with grape taking a close second. They make a great low calorie snack. TL;DR Delicious snack"
"This is an all-time favorite tea of mine. I spend hundreds of dollars a year on tea - and this tea really hits the spot in my favorite top ten list of teas. The only downfall about this tea is that it is not made with strings. I like to have strings on my bags of tea. But no matter what this is the best peppermint tea i've ever drank!<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings is a great brand.<br /><br />This tea will smell up your kitchen with a lovely invigorating scent. Perfect for the mornings.<br /><br />I also use this tea when my stomach is upset, if my joints are sore, to help with cramps, and to help with gas! Peppermint is a natural reliever for IBS, especially if you have the flu or a bad cold peppermint tea really seems to bring up your spirits and relieve stomach irritations. TL;DR Pepper-rific!"
"EBOOST gave me the right kind of boost. It made me feel energized, alert, focused, and ready to get through my day. What it didn't do was make me feel anxious or jittery like many other energy drinks.<br /><br />Full of B vitamins, Vitamin C,and other essential nutrients, EBOOST gives your body what it needs to enhance your immune system and keep you going in a good way.<br /><br />The taste is ok. It tastes a lot like an orange drink with a dash of salt. The salty taste most likely comes from the bicarbonates. But, it's really not that bad at all. Getting the desired effect far outweighs the slight salty taste.<br /><br />A cool glass of EBOOST will clear your mind and make you feel more refreshed than you've felt in a long, long time. Definitely a healthier choice than one of the popular canned energy drinks. TL;DR Gives The Right Kind of Boost"
"I liked the idea of an organic sweetener, so I was prepared to make Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Stevia my preferred product, but after trying it for a month, I think I shall stay with my old favorite, Splenda.  Stevia is ""OK"", but I found it to be not as sweet, when used in some instances.  My breakfast Cheerios needed at least two packets, and still didn't seem to pack the sweet flavor.  Plus I found the individual packets rather difficult to open sometimes.  They are kind of a foil/plastic type packet, and occasionally they fight back when I try to open them.  Plus sometimes the product is lumpy inside, despite the packaging.  If you are truly wary of side effects of other sweeteners, than this should work for you.  But I'm not going to give up my old brand. TL;DR It's ok, but not my favorite artificial sweetener."
"It was in the 1920s that the H.B. Reese Candy Company first began manufacturing a product made with specially processed peanut butter and Hershey's milk chocolate. Back then the product was simply known as peanut butter cups, but today the popular candy is known as Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. Harry Burnett Reese was actually a former dairy employee of Milton S. Hershey, the founder of the Hershey Foods Corporation who was inspired by the example and went off to make his own fortune in the candy industry. Reese made a lot of other products, such as Johnny Bars (caramel-like molasses) and Lizzie Bars (coconut candy), but in the end his fortune was made by this single product, which offered a simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate.<br /><br />In the 1920s, from a factory located down the street from that of Hershey, Reese began selling his peanut butter cups in 5 lb. boxes to be used in candy assortments. In the 1930s he added the cups, which were originally sold for a penny each. During World War II Reese discontinued all his other products and just made the peanut butter cups, which were distributed through wholesale jobbers, vending machine operators and syndicated stores. After World War II the peanut butter cups, now in their familiar orange, yellow and brown wrapping, continued to gain national popularity. In 1963 the H.B. Reese Candy Company, Inc., was sold for $23.5 million to the Hershey Chocolate Company, and in 1976 the first variation in the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup was made with the introduction of Reese's Crunchy Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />In 1992 Reese's started selling its own peanut butter in a jar, in 1994 it offered Reese's bits for baking, and in 1998 the company launched ReeseSticks to go along with the Fastbreak, Nutrageous, and Bites, not to mention peanut butter Christmas trees, pumpkins, eggs, and all the other seasonal products. Now even have White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which pretty much defines heaven on earth for me in terms of candy making. But behind this growing array of candy products there remains the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. There is something to be said for the simple combination of peanut butter and chocolate, as immortalized in the ""you got chocolate in my peanut butter/you got peanut butter in my chocolate"" ad campaign that inspired many Americans to walk around eating peanut butter out of a jar.<br /><br />Now, you can certainly make your own peanut butter cups. You just need 12 paper muffin cups, a 12-ounce package of milk chocolate chips, a cup of reduced-fat peanut butter, 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, a 1/4 of a teaspoon of salt, a pair of scissors, microwave, and refrigerator. But it will take you a couple of hours to make 12 candies. Or you can buy this 6 pack of peanut butter cups and just enjoy eating them without resorting to making them. TL;DR The simple pleasure of chocolate combined with peanut butter"
"No Fear used to be my coffee, but tastier and without the ex-lax effect. Out of all the much worse energy drinks out there (Rock Star and it's billion different flavors, Red Bull you can feel the kidney stones going down your throat practically, Full Throttle's dry and dehydrating drinks and Monster just doesn't count as an energy drink) No Fear was taken off the shelves. The Mother Load I may be able to understand, because that may have been a heart attack in a can. The regular red can, the sugar free and the orange dragon fruit had what every other energy drink out there lacks: delicious taste. There's something else about it, and I don't know how they did it but it also doesn't make you crash. When caffeine wears off it wears you out, but No Fear surprisingly didn't give you that effect. I encourage stores to put this product back on the shelves and No Fear to freaking keep producing these perfect replacements for coffee! TL;DR Best energy drink period."
"We've been eating this for years. In fact since before they changed the name. It was originally named with a three letter word (similar to darn) that Amazon won't let me write. We've tried quite a number of variations of this and it always turns out good. Sausage works well. Add cream cheese, sour cream, cheddar cheese, or bacon when serving. We only buy from Amazon as they have the best pricing so sometimes we have to wait for stock but it's worth the wait. When we don't want to make it from scratch or just want smaller batches this is the way to go. YUM! TL;DR Dang Good Eating"
"At the time of this review the title notes that this is a ""hot chocolate tin"" while it can easily be made into ""hot chocolate"" the buyer should know this is unsweetened cocoa...not a hot chocolate mix.  BUT...<br /><br />that said...<br /><br />Coming from a household of two foodies, two gourmet cooks (one a trained chef) and chocolate LOVERS...if you have yet to replace whatever cocoa you are using  with Scharffen berger, best do so now. :-)  Ohhhh this stuff is the best.<br /><br />I actually read about this cocoa, cough cough, in People Magazine about 10 years ago and was intriqued due to the level of true cocoa bean in it...unlike any other so called ""gourmet"" cocoa.  At that time I couldn't find it anywhere and had to order it from the company. Now I find it in some grocery stores...unfortunately just the ""upscale"" or ""all natural ones""..not a bad thing, but I don't shop there every week, so not a good thing either for me at least if you are trying to find it locally.  I hope to see it more mainstream soon.<br /><br />Because we are foodies, if we like something at a restaurant it's not uncommon for us to wind up talking to the manager or chef about ingredients that stand out. In the past 3 years when I have asked about a chocolate dessert I think only once were they not using this.<br /><br />Is it great as hot cocoa? Sure...but that is SO limiting its use. I just use it for any recipe calling for cocoa.<br /><br />Negative: I have no negative on taste or quality and ratio of real cocoa used...that can't be beat. However, the price is higher...I'd rather have it in a less fancy tin and kick it down a notch on price...but I pay it and so does anyone else I know into baking...so maybe they don't have to consider that...still, it is higher so I have to grumble SOME... TL;DR Best stuff on earth...but it's not ""hot chocolate"" only"
"This is an arabica blend.  This coffee leaves a lot to be desired.  Typical waiting room quality coffee<br />Great for the breakroom at work, but I would not chose to drink this. TL;DR not 100% arabica!!!!"
This is very good whole wheat pasta. It isn't sticky/starchy like some other whole wheat pastas and it's organic. It's cheaper buying it at Amazon than it is buying it at the store. TL;DR Great Pasta
My 2 year old and 8 year old love these.  We use them as snacks or for breakfast on busy mornings.  I have to limit them to 1 per day or they'd be gone in a couple of days! TL;DR good for kids

"The only reason for it not getting 5 stars is that, among my hot sauce collection, there's other sauces that go better with specific foods. I like Cholula and Garlic Tabasco are better on pizza. I favor Amazon(the hot sauce brand) Sriracha on chili, for a sweet/hot kick.<br /><br />There is no sauce more versatile than this one, though. You can safely put it on ANYTHING and it won't disappoint. The squeezable, perfectly-sized big bottle, with the green cap acting as a hose nozzle is the perfect vessel for a sauce with which you will be painting any edible thing you can find. TL;DR The Ketchup of Hot Sauces"
Came just as promised.  The coffee itself was rich and fresh.  The blueberry cobler flavor is distinct.  I give 2 thumbs up! TL;DR Exactley what I was expecting
"I'VE BEEN USING YOUR CEYLON CINNAMON FOR ADDED CONTROL OF GLUCOSE LEVELS AND FIND IT TO BE EFFECTIVE IN HELPING TO BRING DOWN GLUCOSE LEVELS. I THINK THE RESULTS MAY VARY FROM ONE INDIVDUAL TO ANOTHER, BUT FOR ME IT HAS SHOWN GOOD RESULTS. IF NOTHING ELSE THE FLAVOR AND TEXTURE IS FAR BETTER THAN CASSIA BARK CINNAMON. GOOD STUFF! TL;DR TRUE QUALITY"
Excellent!  Best chocolate truffles I have ever had.  I received them as a gift from a student.  I have to admit I gave a lot away (there are 80! in the box) but that was only because I found them very addicting and didn't want to imagine what 80 truffles would do to my hips (because I WOULD have eaten all 80 - they are that good!). TL;DR Wow!  Chocolate heaven!
"this is a classic...who wouldn't love this tea?  the peppermint taste is intense and sharp without being overwhelming.  i enjoy bigalow's 'mint medly' flavor, but find this to taste so much more...authentic and closer to nature.  and i love that they do not individually package each tea bag--always seems like a waste of the earth's resources--but the tea always stays fresh. TL;DR A Classic"
"I loved wintergreen Altoids!  In fact I loved them so much I stocked up last year at Easter when they were on sale for half price.  I had enough to last until this week.  So I bought a couple of tins at my local grocery.  Today I opened one and found out 1) they are now blueish in color and 2) the taste is terrible!  What prompted Wrigley or whomever to change these?  I can't describe the taste except that it is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste - nothing like the Altoids I used to love (and I had a few left today so I could compare side-by-side).  If you love Wintergreen Altoids and haven't had the blue ones yet, don't buy them.  You will be very very disappointed.  I'm going to return the unopened tin and see if the grocery will take the opened one back too. TL;DR ugh - why did they change the taste to this?"
"Bent, damaged cans, 3 of which were broken open and had to be discarded; that's 6 dollars in the toilet. I also buy 24 can packages of the cheaper cat food for the ferals, which always arrive in pristine condition. This Wellness is the most expensive cat food available, the packaging should reflect the value of the contents. TL;DR fine food, abysmal packaging"
"This mustard is not nearly as spicy as the authentic product from Germany which I have tried.  This seems like an ""Americanized"" version which I would not purchase again in the future. TL;DR This mustard is not the same as authentic Lowensenf from Germany."
"All our local stores have stopped selling small shells - what's with that?  None to be found for MN hotdish (locally called a cassarole) so life is now good again!  Have to say they get quite large when cooked, however.  Great texture, no heavy starch and we are grinning.  Fast shipment, by the way, and carefully packed. TL;DR Hard to fine locally"
Newman's Own bold organic coffee makes a great cup of coffee!  A little stronger than some of the other coffees--we love it. TL;DR great coffee
if u love watermelon jolly ranchers like i do u wouldnt waste ur time buying small time bags at the store to pick out the 5 watermelon jollys when u can get a whole frickkin box of them 160. mmmmmmmm watermelon jollys TL;DR ballin
"I bought this as a gift and opened the box to make sure everything was presentable due to other reviews. I wanted to be sure nothing was cracked and the lid fit. Everything was ok. It was packed for shipping well. Yes, the pot is small, but it is for one person after all. There is a hole at the top of the lid designed to let steam out. That might have been what someone was calling a bubble in the glass. It felt pretty sturdy, but the handles could have been made a little thicker. I was hoping to be able to see or smell the teas, but they are sealed in a box. I am pleasantly surprised that this doesn't have a weird chemical smell to the wood as other mass produced, cheaper items are prone to have. The inside of the gift box is nothing special, just the pot, the box of blossoms, and a bunch of brown confetti-like strips of paper stuffing. The box has this orange/red ""leather"" stringing it together. I think they could have put in a little more effort and used a natural looking leather or even twine, and displaying the blossoms in the gift box instead of hiding them in a box that looks at home on a grocery shelf. But I am picky. Even though I haven't tried the blossoms, I drink Numi tea myself and I think they are great quality teas. I will probably buy a set for myself soon. TL;DR Looks nice."
"I love the chocolate mixes and the corn muffin mix, but I really do not care for this mix. I added fresh blueberries on top like they recommended, but they are still something I would rather avoid than eat. TL;DR Least Favorite Mix"
"I had tried okra chips from Fresh Market and these are even better.  I'm not sure how they do it, but these retain the nice bright green color of fresh okra.  They are crunchy, have a very strong taste of okra and just the right amount of salt.  They are not greasy at all and are nicely packaged so they are not crushed or broken.  If you like okra chips, you should get these. TL;DR Love these"
"The bag is strong enough that I don't hesitate to use it to pick up my dog's poop. And, I'm glad to know that it is compostable.<br />good product; good cost. TL;DR Effective"
Sent this as a holiday gift to out of state relatives.  They said basket/presentation was nice but the different food items didn't have a large number of pieces per package. TL;DR Portions could be larger
I bought a 12 pack of Crunch 'n Munch from Amazon. It is one of my favorite treats. I love the 4 ounce packages. They're so fresh when you open them. I usually eat a whole package at one time. This popcorn is delightful and buttery tasting.<br /><br />Amazon has a great price on these and they arrived very fresh. I will continue to buy these from Amazon. I love getting these delivered right to my door. TL;DR One of my Favorite Treats!
"This one has lots of black pest. Too many live black pest, so things was irritating. Rice grain was good though if they can remove the black pest. TL;DR black rice pest"
"This is a new hobby for me and it has been fun roasting my own coffee beans with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BLIDD8"">Toastess TCP-388 Hot-Air Popcorn Maker</a>. I have tried just a few deferent types but so far I think this is one of my favorite so far. I have been experimenting with roasting times leaning toward dark French roast 13.5min/sec @ 497° (espresso). I have noticed the heavy oily residue on the bean not seen on others and a more robust aroma and taste. I will buy another bag soon I hope the price goes back down; I think it was a little cheaper a few months ago. Oh the dirty little bean comment, burlap sack fibers and strings were in the bag for that special flavor. Overall for the price and freshness I give it 4 stars. TL;DR You dirty little bean"
"I LOVE these colors. I used them in pastry school to make brightly colored buttercreams and fondants, and there really is no substitute. In a lot of confection making, using too much color will ruin the formula and your product will come out poorly. These colors have worked for even the most delicate uses! I was so excited to be able to buy my own, and I'm sure they'll be getting a lot of use in the near future. :) TL;DR Amazing color payoff"
"I suppose we are all creatures of habit. Mine is coffee, lot's of it. I like a well made percolator coffee, but years ago I discovered Tasters Choice. It's my favorite instant, hands down. Just put a teaspoons-worth in a coffee cup of water and nuke it in the microwave for 1:45 (well, in MY micro, anyway). The coffee is strong for some tastes; do you like espresso? Well, not that strong but definitely potent. Amazon sells it at about the same price as the local stores and with free-shipping that's a real convenience. Love coffee? Looking for something new? Here you are. TL;DR Instant Coffees"
"I was skeptical of this product at first. I saw a chef use them on TV and was intrigued by the thought of a 'no calorie noodle.' I boiled the water and used a hand strainer to rinse them. When you cut the package open the noodles have a terrible sour smell which freaked me out at first because that smell would taste terrible. However, when you rinse the noodles well and drop them into very hot boiling water, they have no taste at all. It was pretty amazing. They have the consistancy of bean thread noodles. Definitely worth a try. TL;DR Great Product"
"These are surprisingly good for a bar that is essentially fruits and nuts smashed together.  Everything involved in these bars at least sounds healthy, so I was expecting to taste cardboard.  I was happy to discover that these are actually quite tasty, though the peanut flavor overpowers many of the other more subtle flavors in the bar.<br /><br />I would have to say that if you enjoy fruits and nuts and are looking for a tasty bar for a bike ride or a road trip, these are an excellent choice.<br /><br />The two negatives I've found:<br />1) these are rather sticky - so think about that before handing one to the 3 year old<br />2) they are not sweet in the sense that many people have come to expect.  They are naturally sweet, but are not loaded down with artificial sweeteners. TL;DR You've gotta like fruit and nuts"
"I don't think you can go wrong with this product. It is NOT old and musty as another reviewer said, and I didn't find ANY stems  or anything other than tea leaves. I drink 3 cups every day - great price! TL;DR good taste at a great price!I"
Had these sent to my mother and she was very disappointed. She sent me a picture of what she received and they looked nothing like the picture. It was embarassing. The seller issued a full refund without a problem. TL;DR Looks nothing like the picture
"Knowing me and wanting to try foods from different countries, I thought I'd try this...and let me say: I LOVE it!<br />Melon is probably one of my favorite flavors and the paste inside was just great! Though for me it was a bit too addicting, so it was hard for me to leave more for later.<br />I also shared some with my brother and he with his children, they loved it as well thinking it was kind of like a gummy treat.<br />I DEFINATELY will buy again! &lt;3 TL;DR LOVE!"
A lasting memory for all my grandchildren. Arrived in excellent condition.  The only problem was it was shipped to early. TL;DR Grandaughters loved it.
"I've looked everywhere online for the original TVP that I used to buy from ADM's country store in Decatur, IL. In these folks, I finally found it. They're courteous, very friendly and are just good people. They ship quickly and package in ways that make sense. ie: I bought 25lbs. They shipped in 5-5lb. bags instead of one 25lb. bag. I won't be buying from anyone else and I use a lot of this product as I'm primarily vegetarian. If I could give it 10 stars, I would! TL;DR Barry Farms TVP-Yummy!!!!!"
"For a zero calorie soft drink, I like Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink better than most other similar drinks. It tastes good, with no noticeable after-taste. I use a little less than the recommended amount to suit my taste. I haven't noticed any real energy boost though. I'll stick to coffee if I need a caffeine jolt. As for the vitamins its infused with, I guess they can't hurt, but don't confuse Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink as something healthy. It's a zero calorie, zero carb beverage, that is sweetened with Sucralose. They also added some caffeine and vitamins, but it's probably more for marketing than anything else. If you're a fan of diet soft drinks, you'll probably like Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink. If you don't like sugar free soft drinks, then definitely look elsewhere. TL;DR I like it."
"Her Whiteness eats it.  It stays down and comes out well.  A bonus is healthy coat and skin.  Even her vet with her own line to sell doesn't recommend taking her off it. TL;DR Beautiful coat, no hot spots"
To be honest I'm quite amazed that this tastes good. Better than some of those vitamin waters or sports drinks. Tastes kind of like a muted version of melted grape Popsicle. TL;DR Surprisingly good!
These pops are the rage on the Weight Watchers message boards.  They are green apple pops covered with caramel.  At 60 calories (or one WW point) they are a great sweet treat that takes a long time to savor. TL;DR Litlle caramel covered apples!
"These are the best sunflower seeds out there. When I was deployed to Iraq and our stash ran out, the company sent our unit an entire case! The flavor is not too strong and the seeds are always fresh, not to mention that they're giant. Now that I'm deployed again, and they don't sell Giants over here, I plan on ordering a dozen bags to share with all my friends. TL;DR Great Seeds!"
"This is an excellent men's shampoo that should be used once or twice a week to keep your scalp feeling great and moisturized. I wouldn't recommend using it everyday as zinc pyrithione may scour the scalp if used a lot. Think of it as an exfoliating treatment for your head.<br /><br />I have read reports that Zinc pyrithione may reduce hair shedding and I have read reports that excessive use may cause hair shedding. So my advice is to use it once or twice a week tops and you will notice an improvement in the feeling of your scalp and your hair will smell very nice. Used like this, it works fantastic.<br /><br />This shampoo seems a little more creamier than Head and Shoulders and your hair smells and feels better since this has other ingredients that H&S doesn't have {Panax Ginseng Root Extract, Tea Tree, Mint, Coconut Oil, Sunflower Seed Oil}.<br /><br />Overall, great men's shampoo and I highly recommend it. TL;DR Excellent Men's Shampoo"
I have tried several different brands of Earl Grey including a couple of loose leaf varieties from fancy tea boutiques. I really must admit that Bigelow's version is probably one of my top two favorites (Stash also makes a nice Earl Grey). It has a nice smooth and balanced flavor and the bergamot is spot on. I also like that it is all natural and made with real bergamot oil. It is also easy to find in almost any grocery store. Five stars! TL;DR One of the better Earl Grey's even for a tea snob.
I have two preschoolers that just love these!  This is the best price anywhere as well..I hate having to go to a health food store and pay almost double locally. TL;DR My Kids love these!!
"My toddler LOVES these!!!  She begs for them the moment we get into the car when I pick her up from preschool.  The only hard this is that she can't open the cap by herself (which I don't mind, or else, she's ""break into them"").  The cap is also resealable, which is nice in case.  I highly recommend these. I used to buy Ella's Kitchen Organic Smoothies and baby food pouches, but they are WAY more expensive!  The taste is just as great!  Buy these! TL;DR DELICIOUS!"
"In response to the reviewer who said this product attracts insects from all over. I have a good selection of insects in my house, from ants to flies to roaches, silverfish etc. I'm not overrun with any of them (or I would call an exterminator). I have had a couple of these 'baits' set out for a month or two and have not a single insect of any size caught in either one.<br />Either they forgot to put attractant in mine or it's all BS. TL;DR Yeah, right!"
"One weekend when I was terribly sick with the stomach flu, my doctor, in addition to prescribing medication,  suggested I eat ginger candy.  The candy has a spicy hot taste which was not appealing to me initially but it did seem to help my stomach ailment.  I now buy Reed's Ginger Candy to have on hand all the time for minor indigestion. TL;DR It helps"
"So, everyone in the family tried a cookie. The grownups liked the cookies, the kids were split. These ""Fruit thins"" have a little bit of a European taste about them in that they are not really very sweet. The fruit bits are chewy and there is quite a bit of Citrus flavor in the entire cookie. All in all a tasty cookie as long as you are not expecting an Oreo. TL;DR I like these, but the kids are not sure..."
"I have a 9 year old son with Celiac disease and I love that companies are coming out with gluten-free alternatives.  I know that going gluten free has become a fad lately, so I do worry that some of the new alternatives will fade away eventually.  I just hope that this cake mix sticks around for a long time!<br /><br />This is seriously the best tasting gluten free chocolate cake mix.  Heck, I even prefer it to the regular chocolate cake mix varieties.  It is so moist and rich, without being sickeningly sweet.  There isn't any odd texture that some other gluten free desert mixes have.  It is also extremely simple to prepare.  There aren't any complicated steps, waiting periods or odd ingredients that need to be added.  I love being able to just bake ONE cake for birthdays without having to hear others make off remarks about it tasting weird.  I don't think anyone would know that it was gluten free unless they were told. TL;DR I really hope that Betty Crocker doesn't discontinue their GF products.  This is my son's favorite cake mix"
"These mushrooms are wonderful!  They taste rich and woodsy, and add real complexity to soups, stews or anyplace you would use fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />Dried mushrooms don't weigh much, so you will find your order may be larger than you expect.  The supplier recommends that you store them in the refrigerator or freezer.<br /><br />Shipping was amazing.  I ordered them on Friday and received them on Monday, standard shipping -- the package started in Massachusetts and arrived in Seattle in four days!  Very happy with that! TL;DR Great Mushrooms!"
"I sent this to my parents as a little ""thinking of you/missing you"" gift and they absolutely loved it. TL;DR They loved it"
I was looking for a canned bread with flavor for long-term storage. This product fills that need. I wish it was a little less pricey. The flavor is good. The biggest challange was getting it out of the can! I had to cut open both ends of the can and it still was a battle! TL;DR Good Product
I was searching for GoldenFruit cookies and found the Garibaldi biscuits.  They were extremely close to the GoldenFruit which is no longer made.  I enjoyed them very much.  Time to order some more. TL;DR biscuit review
This is my favorite first eye-opening cup in the morning.  Great jolt without any bitterness. TL;DR Bold coffee
"I have been using La Tourangelle Avocado Oil in 'everything' since receiving my order couple weeks or so back. I like not strong olive oil (usually like the buttery kind from late ripe olives). I tasted some of this avocado oil alone and it is a bit stronger than ""buttery"" olive oil as it does have a bit of a 'bite'. I still do like it, though. I've used it for sauteing, on toast with onion or garlic powder, salads, rubbed some in my skin and a tiny bit on my chapped lips. I may get it again as I like to have a variety in my diet plus the avocado oil is good for moisturizing my skin. My fave oil is golden flax oil by Community Living Foods, except it should not be used for frying or heating. TL;DR Reminds Me Of Olive Oil"
This coffee was a big disappointment. The strength and flavor were inconsistent and usually weak. I would not purchase this brand again. TL;DR not good
"Hemp seeds are higher in Omega 3 than walnuts! These are a great addition to my morning health shake, salads... Amazon has the very best pricing on most all of their items, this is definitely one of them! I purchase many Nutiva products and have never been disappointed! These are a mega-must to add to your healthy diet!! TL;DR Mega Omega!"
"Such an amazing, clean taste.  I used to have to hunt down excellent-quality salts, but it is so easy to order this on Amazon.  I love a briny salt sometimes, but it doesn't go with everything.  The celtic salt is totally all-purpose -- I use it in baking and to salt just about anything.  The one issue with it is that it's a very moist salt so it doesn't have the easy-pour most people hope for.  Himalayan salt does very well for that.  But the himalayan salt, despite its awesome properties, can feel gritty at times, even though it dispenses well from a standard salt shaker.  Ultimately, I totally prefer the celtic salts, so I throw some rice into my shakers as a dessicant, and even though it takes a little bit of effort to be sure the salt is unclumped, you know you're getting a high-quality product that is feeding your body and tastes divine. TL;DR Wonderful"
I love this tea by itself or combined in my own Russian Caravan blend. Assam combined with hint of Lapsang Souchong and an oolong is delicious. I like knowing exactly what teas are in a blend. Most purchased blends do not give details on their labels. TL;DR Love it
"I've purchased several bottles of the hot chipotle ketchup.  I find that it enhances many somewhat mild dishes, without overpowering them.  To me, it's not 'hot', but just adds some needed 'zing' to my foods! TL;DR A different sauce - with many uses."
I am a very picky person when it comes to non-fat dry milk.  I specifically ordered this product for a dry cocoa mix or hot chocolate mix I was making for friends during the holidays.  This Organic Valley Non-Fat Dry Milk makes it taste just like milk!  My mix turned out perfect - tastes just like Carnation or Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate Mix when you add water to it.  Thanks for offering this product! TL;DR Best Non-Fat Dry Milk on the Market!
"I like Bob's Red Mill products and this four pack is a good price, at least where I live. The potato starch works well in gluten free recipes. TL;DR Good price"
I couldn't be happier with these gummi bears.  Taste just like they did when I was a kid.  I also really like the 2 oz. size.  I did the subscribe and save and look forward to many shipments of my favorite candy. TL;DR Take me back to my childhood
Happy I found this K-cup holder replacement part for my mini Keurig coffee machine. The original one had been accidentally thrown away in the trash.  Works perfectly! TL;DR K-cupholder - replacement part
"This soup is, by far, the BEST packaged soup I've ever had! It's easy to make and can be 'made to taste' by using enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce. Either one is wonderful. We melt cheese on top and add corn chips! YUMMY!!!! TL;DR The BEST ever!!"
"Good product, nice quality, but these are super juicy and sweet, not at ALL tangy like I'd hoped! I guess that's a good thing though, there is no way you can sit down and eat an entire bag of these, without the tang, they are better suited for baking! TL;DR Not at all tangy!"
"I can't say I'd recommend this coffee.  If not for the convenience, I wouldn't ever have rebought it, but now I've found a better choice for regular coffee in the Tassimo - either Starbucks Breakfast Blend, or Jacobs Kronung.  Both beat this coffee hands down in flavor.  The Jacobs doesn't make as much coffee though.<br />This coffee tastes like vending machine coffee at a highway rest stop - the kind from a machine that hasn't been tended to recently.  Thin and yucky.  Sorry, Gevalia fans.  They make a good espresso, though, and the latte and cappuccino choices are much better.<br />Pass on this one if you're not sure and try one of the others. TL;DR Vending machine coffee tastes better"
"First Impression: The friendly folks over at ""Exclusively Dog"" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4. TL;DR 3 out of 4 Paws"
"I currently have 9 month old breast feeding twins, so protein is a huge need for me, as it was during my pregnancy.<br /><br />It can be really hard to consume the full amount of protein that pregnant ladies should have. Orgain makes this important task so much easier and yummy! I would drink one right before bed and kept one on my bedside table (yes they actually taste great at room temp) and drink it the moment I woke up. I believe that this was a huge part of me not getting morning sickness. That's not even counting the few I always had stashed in the car for when I got stuck in traffic.<br />Now that I'm breast feeding, they are just as important to my daily nutrition. Specially great when you need something fast but you are stuck in bed or have hands full of baby. I could feed me, while I fed them.<br />It is really good to know that I can do all this without consuming fake sugars that can be dangerous to my babes or lots chemicals that most commercial shakes have. This shake has a great wide array of the good stuff and little or none of the bad.<br /><br /> Amazon Subscribe & Save  gives you pretty much the best price I have ever found.<br /><br />Great Uses:<br /><br />  * Put them in coffee at home, wow!<br />  * Make them the base of a larger blender smoothie<br />  * On your bedside for late night breastfeeding refueling<br />  * On your bedside for morning sickness prevention<br />  * In you diaper bag for mommy fuel<br />  * Glove box for getting thru traffic thats makes you late for meals<br />  * Frozen as a desert! TL;DR Delicious & Easy while Pregnant or Breastfeeding!"
"I've been using this Cacao Powder in raw fruit and nut bars, ice creams, cookies, and smoothies/shakes for the past two weeks. It is a bit strong, so use in moderation, but considering it's 100% cacao, isn't that to be expected? Definitely a great buy for the price, and I have dozens of new raw recipes to try it in, so I'm sure I'll be purchasing more soon enough. TL;DR Great for Raw Deserts"
"Superior vanilla beans come from the Madagascar ""Bourbon Islands,"" Mexico and Indonesia. It took me years to get up the courage to buy a vanilla bean.<br /><br />When I did, I found the flavor was truly superior to vanilla extract. While you don't want to use vanilla beans in everything (too expensive!), you will definitely want to consider using them in custards and when you make ice cream.<br /><br />Vanilla enhances everything from creamy porridges to custards and cakes. The list goes on and on. There are so many uses for vanilla. Vanilla is derived from the seductively aromatic vanilla bean.<br /><br />Vanilla beans are actually the cigar-shaped seed pod from a fragrant climbing orchid native to tropical America.<br /><br />Yes, vanilla extract is much more economical, but using vanilla beans is rather gourmet. The extract is created from chopped vanilla beans that are soaked in an alcohol/water solution. It takes about 100 beans to make 1 gallon of extract.<br /><br />I've been using pieces of vanilla beans, but on Food TV<br /><br />they always split these down the middle and also scrape<br /><br />out the vanilla for superior vanilla flavor.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review TL;DR Food TV is making me hungry..."
"My favorite coffe shop uses this brand for their chais that they sell. I used to be able to get Pacific Chai at my grocery store, but they stopped carrying it. Luckily, Amazon to the rescue! I know it's not nutritious but it can warm you up and it is totally delicious. My daughter and I prefer the vanilla flavor, and if you heat up some Silk brand soy milk & blend it with the mix ( instead of the water the label calls for) it is really amazing! Plus, we women need to get our iso-flavanoids, and this is a really yummy way. I've used regular milk too, but believe me, for some reason the soy is so much better. I've even got my totally soya-phobic co-workers drinking it that way, and the owner of the coffe shop actually put soy milk on the menu as an option with the chai. Like my title states, it's probably not authentic chai but it is still super tasty and the spices ( cinnamon, ginger, cloves) are very warming. It's the perfect drink on a cold day or if you have the chills and can't seem to get warm. The label says you can serve it cold but I haven't tried that yet; to me it just seems like a hot drink.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ingredients really do suck- non-dairy creamer w/coconut oil & corn syrup solids. Black tea is waaaay down on the list. But, I just take it for what it is; an occasional indulgence when I crave something hot & sweet & spicy ( of the non-masculine variety! ) to warm me up. TL;DR Probably not authentic, but totally yummy."
"I am from Hawaii and crave passion fruit Lilokoi, try getting it in Kansas though :(, it's no where to be found most products that I can have shipped from Hawaii are pretty much tourist strength i.e. weak. My only other option was from another seller on Amazon for a concentrate but  it is ridiculously overpriced and then they are asking 70 dollars S/H....LOLOLOLOL that wasn't happening.  I took a gamble but being a junkie and all I am not at all disappointed it tastes great.  They shipped far sooner then they predicted the cost for S/H on 3 bottles was still the same price as it was for 1 so I ordered 3, I am going to make a wedding cake for my daughter and with the leftovers I am going to make ice shave and juice drinks. Thanks for a great transaction and product. TL;DR Stellar product and speed."
"it was cute seeing all of these candies together in one package, but most of it can easily be bought at local mass market stores.  Also - many of the candies were simply stale - and inedible.  Not really worth the money unless you have money to throw away. TL;DR Cute but mostly a waste of money"
"We have ordered this product before and love it.  We put it on everything we grill, even shrimp and assorted vegetables (like mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, summer squash, zucchini, onions, sweet potatoes ). Yum TL;DR taste of Greece"
"Based on other reviews of this margarita mix, I decided to give it a try.  I have been cutting unnecessary sugars and alcohol from my diet but had an annual camping trip planned where there would be drinking and didn't want to be left out of all the fun!  I am so glad I bought this mix!  It's delicious and I ended up sharing with a few others who agreed--it does have a very sweet taste, so it tasted like a sweet lemonade, even with tequila mixed in!  I am definitely going to be trying the other flavors they offer! TL;DR Delicious!"
"I've tried a couple of other coffees through amazon.  The best was probably Cameron's Organic French Roast, but just by a hair above the Dark Brazilian Santos. Another one I tried was Coffee Bean Direct French Roast Papua New Guinea which really didn't taste like real french roast.It was just okay.  The worst was Eight O'Clock French Roast.  The beans were pale, not oily and this was reflected in the pale boring taste of the brewed coffee. As soon as I opened the bag of Dark Brazilian I could see that the beans were dark and oily and the flavor was a truly rich french roast.  There may be better french roast coffees out there but for the price this is an excellent buy. I would highly recommend this to any  french roast loving coffee drinkers out there. TL;DR Making my second order"
"I've never been one to write a review on anything, but I just had to comment on the primrose Filled Red Raspberry Candy.  Needless to say, there are NONE left as I thought I could keep these little treasures to myself, but my son couldn't stay away from them.  They are absolutely delicious and brought back memories of my childhood days when I would pick out these pieces from the holiday mixed candy that my mother would bring home.  In fact, once I complete this review I intend to order this candy again. I'm hooked and loving it. TL;DR Tasty Little Treasure"
"This is one of the most popular flavors of drink mix around this house. It has good flavor and is quick and easy to make. I like the new packaging much better. And shopping here on Amazon is great as it is cheaper than Crystal Light at Walmart, but not cheaper than the GV brand (which is probably the same stuff). TL;DR Good tasting drink"
"My puppy loves it, and I love my puppy.  She doesn't eat a whole lot just yet, but she will soon.  Looks like it costs about $50-$60 for a month's supply.  Considering that I spend that much on myself in a week, I'll gladly spend that much on my sweet Layla for a month.  The better you spend on dog food, the less you'll spend in the veterinarian's office.  And that's exactly what I told my vet when I took her in for her rounds of shots, and she agreed wholeheartedly.  She only wants my money for routine office visits.  I firmly believe that Wellness dog foods will help ensure that you only take your beloved pet to the vet for routine maintenance. TL;DR So far, so good..."
"These are great as a healthy snack. I find them quite tasty, but I do not like the ones without the sesame seeds! Easy to throw in a lunchbox and better than 99% (if not 100%) of what's in most vending machines when you want (need?) something a little salty and gluten free. TL;DR relatively healthy snack"
"I was looking for some great matcha that I can use for tea, lattes, etc. This is wonderful! I use my hand mixer to blend it in milk with some agave nectar and it makes a great latte! :o) TL;DR Great product!"
"I had intended to buy whole leaf tea, but this is tea that has been cut into small pieces.  It still works in my teapot infuser, but some of it tends to leak through into the tea.  The tea tastes fine, but next time I will make sure to get whole leaf tea for my teapot. TL;DR Darjeeling loose tea"
"This stuff is absolutely terrible. There was pretty much zero taste despite the ungodly amount of salt it seemed to contain. I think it would make decent bomb shelter food, that's about it. TL;DR gag me with a fork"
"I liked this flavor and the whole single cup system. I am not a avid coffee drinker, but I do like an occasional couple of cups a day. However, I will go several days between drinking any coffee.The single cups last and store longer with no waste.The key to this and all single cup coffee's is the water level. Just a bit more or less water in the coffee blend is critical to the taste.I find that if I fill my coffee cup with too much water, the flavor is watery. I find that the best level is really too small a cup of coffee, however adding the flavored creames allow you to use more water making a larger cup without sacrificing taste. TL;DR Single cup coffee's"
All my cans were smashed up and one was open. Reminded me of the opening scene in Ace Ventera pet Detective. Its was that bad. Dont think Ill reorder. Maybe go with C2O heard thats the cats pajamas. TL;DR Crushed cans.
"First, I have to say that the price here on the website is WAY too expensive for a 5 lb. bag.  This is not the actual price in the store, OR on the Cardinal Lab website.  Expect to pay around $15 at PetSmart.<br /><br />Second, my picky dog absolutely loves this dog food.  I'm going to have to buy lots more of it.<br /><br />Third, the ingredients are Organic, grain free, and contains probiotics, lots of protein (MEAT), and vitamins - though it doesn't say whether they're chelated or not.<br /><br />Overall - He eats it + Good ingredients + Solid poo = 5 stars. TL;DR EXCELLENT DOG FOOD!  My picky dog ate ALL of it..."
This is the best spice I've ever used for my cooking. It used to be sold at Whole Foods. Now it seems to only be available here at Amazon.com. I'm happy as long as I can purchase it somewhere. Thanks! TL;DR My favorite spice
Miracle grow potting soil<br />I am pleased with the product. It arrived in a very timely manner as described. I could not be happier with my purchase. TL;DR Potting Soil
"We have enjoyed Market Spice Tea since our first taste at a local Las Vegas coffee house. When the coffee house closed a couple of years ago we didn't even know how to get it again until last summer when we went to Seattle on vacation. The tea is delicious, ordering it on Amazon was easy, the delivery was fast and we all had it for Christmas! TL;DR market spice tea"
"So, I tasted this nummy granola, and it was quite satisfactory. Granted, I probably wouldn't reach for it to just snack on plain (i.e. just the granola itself. Instead, I decided to add it to my Greek yogurt. Mmmmmm! LOVED it! It wasn't too crunchy, and by the time I was done with my yogurt and granola, it wasn't soft/mushy/soggy; the granola didn't have the same crunch and solid firmness as it did to begin with, but it wasn't a ""wimpy"" granola that got soft/soggy after a short period of time.<br /><br />I'd recommend it if someone were thinking of buying it. Would it be my first choice? Depends. But I do know that it tastes great, is not TOO hard right out of the bag, and won't get soft sitting in yogurt for simply a short period of time. TL;DR not the best, but still good"
Of all the Ostrim products I personally like these best.  A nice combination of taste and nutrition.<br /><br />Decent protein level - 14 g per stick<br />Low calorie - 100 per stick<br />Low fat - 3 g per<br /><br />A little high on sodium - 600 mg - but it's a meat stick after all.<br /><br />A nice alternative for the many sweet protein supplement choices that exist - as well as a nice change from chicken. :) TL;DR Tasty Protein - A Great Alternative for Sweet Protein Bars
"If you like hot sauce that adds flavor to what your eating and doesn't kill your taste buds..... This is it! Pork, chicken, beef or fish I've had it on all and it is Crazy Good! TL;DR Crazy Flavor, Crazy Good"
"As far as Pop-Tarts go, this particular flavor is pretty good. I really like the brown sugar filling, and the frosting is also good. The crust is your basic white bread stuff, it would be nice if they had put some cinnamon in the crust too or something, but this Pop-Tart is still overall pretty good. TL;DR Pretty good"
"This is the best Ive ordered yet!  You must add milk or water to it or yes, it will be way too sweet.  I only wish that pieces of the fruit were included!  I'll still give it a 4-5 rating! TL;DR Soursop/guanabana"
"After a year in France buying very high quality chocolate of 70% or higher, at a typical price of about $1.50/100g, I was dismayed to see that in the USA such products routinely fetch $3 or $4 per 100g.  Outrageous!  Then I found Lindt 90% (and others) at Amazon for nearly as good a price as in supposedly expensive France. This is the smoothest textured high density chocolate widely available in the USA. TL;DR best high concentration chocolate for the money"
"Pork Ramen is arguably the Holy Grail of Ramen. For reasons that will confound scholars for centuries to come, you cannot find pork flavor in the store. When I found out pork flavor was available through amazon.com, I felt much like Tom Hank's wife must have felt in Castaway when she found out he was still alive. I was thrilled, I was happy to see Pork Ramen, but I had moved on...I had let it go. It arrived in my building lobby, a simple cardboard box full of throwback happiness. I nailed the noodles-to-water ratio on the first try and had a bowl with an icy cold Mountain Dew. It was like being magically transported back to college and for a moment, if I closed my eyes, I felt almost as though I were sitting in my dorm room in the shadow of a loft bed, playing Starcraft online...and in that moment...I was made whole. TL;DR The Best Kind of Ramen"
"Too often I find black teas develop an unappealing bitterness, but that is not a problem with this lively decaf tea.  I had every intention of ordering the decaf Earl Grey because I love bergamot, but my order was hijacked by an unleashed desire to try something new.  Most decaffeinated beverages produce a different flavor and strength from their unprocessed counterpart, but the full mouth flavor remains intact with this tea.  It is a combination of black teas and nothing else, no flavorings, no additions, and this is a wonderfully satisfying beverage for a purist.  The bag which is like the ""flo-through"" Lipton bags I remember from years ago is attached to a white cotton thread which appears to be knotted at the bag and the paper tag and there is no metal staple.  Each bag is in a fully sealed smooth paper pouch which is also biodegradable, another advantage.  I thought Twinings used light paper envelopes, so that was a fantastic surprise which I appreciate.  I have drunk it with a Splenda but intend to have it with skim milk as well tomorrow.  It was perfect with Trader Joe's Orange Cardamom cookies.  I'll definitely enjoy drinking this tea and recommend it highly, especially to drinkers of peaty Scotch beverages like Laphroaig. TL;DR No bitterness in this full bodied decaf tea"
So glad to find an instant pudding that uses Splenda instead af aspartame. If it's a little too sweet for you just add a pinch of instant coffee and that fixes the peoblem. TL;DR Yummy
Sorry I can't stand this flavor. It is nasty super sweet somehow. Nasty honey taste. This is the only flavor I can't stand! And I need to bash it for 20 words to... TL;DR Ick!
The Island Coconut is one of my favorite blends. I enjoy it in the morning or even if you need that afternoon cup of Java for a pick me up. I must point out while I am a Bold roast Coffee lover this is a mild Roast however the flavor just makes it enjoyable. I would Highly recommend this Coffee. TL;DR One of MY Absolute Favorites!!!
"These pickles are pickled in acetic acid even though the label in English reads brine in large print implying that they are pickled in brine. The can's small print (which is NOT visible in the picture) does report the truth. The use of brine instead of vinegar as a pickling agent results in a tremendous difference in taste. I'm stuck with 12 cans of pickles in vinegar (acetic acid). Vinegar pickles I can get anywhere, and besides I hate the taste of vinegar pickles.I bought these on the strength of the large printed brine on the can. Do NOT buy this brand if you want brined pickles. As vinegar pickles go these are no worse than others of their type. TL;DR Deceptive labeling"
What else can one say about a Snickers? It gives you energy and gets you through the afternoon LOL. The little miniatures are perfect for a bite size snack before bedtime - should we have candy before going to bed? Who cares as long we enjoy it! Just make sure you brush your teeth after - that's what I keep telling my son. He's a Snicker's addict! TL;DR Delicious!
"I love this stuff! I blend 1% milk, ice, a banana, dark chocolate syrup, and a scoop of this every morning for breakfast (sometimes some expresso powder too). It tastes better than a milkshake and is so easy, healthy and portable. I've also made ice cream with it that has turned out great. It has lots and lots of peanut buttery flavor! TL;DR I use it in my breakfast smoothie every day!"
Yumm! I had never brined a turkey before and it turned out great. Very moist and flavorful. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. Two thumbs up. TL;DR Delicious Turkey
"These cookies are very soft, chewable, and delicious! The only problem I had with them is that each cookie is pretty tiny, so I kept eating them. And that means the calories add up in a hurry, as only two of these are 150 calories with 7 grams of fat.  There's almost no way to eat only two.  I don't know if they're quite ""gooey"" as the label claims, but they are quite good. TL;DR Delicious!"
"I am on a sodium restricted diet of my own choice. I also prefer raw nuts for health reasons.  Delivery is prompt, and the product keeps well in the freezer.  I buy these primarily for the base to my dairy free cream soups, so pieces are perfect!  10 lbs lasts about 3 months of soup making, dip making and just plain snacking on!!<br />Here are 3 links to help you with recipes.

"I bought this variety basket for my brother's birthday, he is both a foodie and a man into anime and manga.  It was a lot of fun, a bit smaller than I had hoped.. and had average candy you can pretty much find in specialty shops in the US (if you live in a major city, you can probably find a lot of this stuff in any asian food store) If you live in the middle of nowhere or a small city.. this was worth not driving to a major city to get candy.<br /> I was hoping for more traditional japanese stuff and deffinatly into the wierder flavored items that are hard to get in the states. while there was one odd little buiscut..(I wont post what incase your doing a blind test like we were)  the rest was your average run of the mill asian-american candies.<br /> It was fun, the package is newspaper print, english. the candy was good, we had fun trying each thing and goofing off..  all in all I liked this!<br />Shipping was FAST, if your ordering it for an event.. keep this in mind! I ordered early thinking it would take forever but had it arrive right away! TL;DR not bad"
"I was searching for an adult food to transition my 8-lb Havanese to and came across Chicken Soup.  Not only does she love it (and beg for more), but it seems to agree well with her sometimes sensitive stomach!!  The price is reasonable and I was pleased with the ingredients when compared to other foods.  The food pellets are a good size as well.  I purchased the 6lb bag as a tester, but will probably stick with this size in the future since a 6lb bag will last her about 3 months.  I highly recommend Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul!! TL;DR Great Food, Great Price"
Lemon juice comes in handy when you need to rinse off the body wash you used to get clean and then you still feel soapy. Sooooo enstead of using gallons of extra water to rinse the body wash off just take a half cup of Lemon Juice to a gallon of water and the refreshing feeling has cleaned you off soap free. Alittle more water rinses off the lemon juice and you are a happy person. So at less than $2 a 32 oz. bottle (and you get 12 bottles for under 18 bucks) I say I should be happy the rest of the summer. Lemon juice smells great too! I love this stuff. TL;DR I Love this Lemon Juice.
the 10 little pieces of gummy candy in each bag tastes cheap and chemically. The kids definitely were entertained by the light up tongs...for about 3 minutes that is. Not recommended. TL;DR overpriced and bad taste
"My husband found Numi's Desert Lime tea ""too weird"" so I had to find a Numi variety he would also drink.  I still get Desert Lime but keep it to myself.  Since he already liked green tea, I figured this Jasmine Green was already partially in the ballpark so I bought it.  He loved it.  This tea also has a wonderful aroma (that is Jasmine obviously).  If I am going to serve Numi tea to someone, this is the one I take out to brew.  I've had other people comment on the Desert Lime's being weird so I don't chance it anymore.  The Jasmine Green seems to please everyone.  I think it is because they have drunk so much similar tea in Japanese and Chinese restaurants plus Starbucks and Caribou.  We like this tea iced or hot. I also enjoy it at room temperature.  Like all Numi teas, this has beautiful art on the front done by the woman partner in the Numi tea business. TL;DR Husband Wouldn't Drink Desert Lime Numi So I Added Jasmine Green"
"Although I do not believe this helps with weight loss, it has a great flavor.  My husband, who does not normally drink hot tea, loves this. TL;DR Good Flavor"
"I was hooked on the regular angel hair shirataki noodle pasta and I decided to try this one.  I like it even more than the regular. It has a 'softer' texture or something. It makes a quick filling meal...sometimes I just put pasta sauce over it and put a bit of parm cheese.....and it is 'just like' spaghetti!!!!  Be sure to rinse them well, as they have an odd fishy smell, unless you are making shrimp stir fry with it.....then it doesn't matter at all!<br /><br />I recommend these noodles if you are trying to cut out traditional pasta because of the carb/calorie factor! TL;DR Black Angel Hair Shirataki Noodle Pasta"
"I LOVE these crackers, especially with sushi (I get the fresh-packed from the grocery store). However, after ordering a carton of these crackers, I had to quickly put them all in freezer bags because ALL of the packages had a hole in them and there were cracker crumbs all over the place. I should have been able to take the packages out of the box and store them away in my cabinets without worrying about roaches crawling into the rips in the bags and getting a wasabi high. TL;DR Good crackers, bad supplier"
"If you are looking for a nutty snack that is not too sweet, this might be for you.  My husband and I both tried them.  He thinks this is more of a 5 star item.  He liked the fresh nuts with just a bit of a cocoa taste, and though I liked them, I would say they are maybe in the three star category, because I was hoping for something slightly sweeter.  We both liked that the coating was not a ""come off in your hand"" kind of variety that makes you look for something to wipe your hands on.<br /><br />We both enjoyed them though I don't know that I would purchase them for myself again.  Nothing wrong with them, just not sweet enough for me.  I would however purchase for my husband.<br /><br />As with any nut product, they are high in fiber and the good kind of fat, but you don't want to dip into too many if you are dieting as they run 150 calories for 1/4 cup, so portion accordingly. TL;DR a tasty, not too sweet snack"
"I woke up today, Sunday, to find my Sunday newspaper for the Chicago Tribune wrapped in a plastic bag with the words, ""our instant tastes rich not expensive (sorry Starbucks)""<br /><br />Naturally, I decided to put your Taster's Choice packet to the test.  Could you please define the word ""rich"" according to your dictionary.  To the rest of the world, rich implies full-bodied in a drink.  Nothing about your instant coffee is rich.  It is quite the opposite actually.  The finished product with 6oz of water look exactly like that, dirty water.  Looks like something that would come out of my rain gutter, not my coffee pot.<br /><br />It's tastes is repulsive.  In fact, if I liked drinking hot water, you might have a market.<br /><br />I would reason that the fact your coffee costs ""4x less than Starbucks Via"" is because it is made with 4x less quality.  The taste is in the cup.  You should be embarrassed that you call yourself ""Taster's Choice""  Who's choice?  A zombie?<br /><br />Also, how low can you go?  Your text font on your bag is exactly as Starbucks VIA in their stores.  Come on!  Be original!  Don't sit on the defensive side and use the same ideas as others.  It sounds like someone is losing business on a product that has been horrible from the beginning and is facing real competition.  Maybe you should spend less money on the marketing of the same recipe of Taster's Choice and more money on the development of something that actually is able to compete with VIA.  Back to the drawing board Nescafe.  Your product is horrible and the taste is in the package.  I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  In fact, as a coffee lover, I will make sure everyone I know makes ""the smart choice"" and chooses anything BUT Taster's Choice! TL;DR Nescafe a joke!"
"Before I got my puppy, I was collecting plastic bags (instead of using my reusable cloth bags) from grocery stores to pick up my puppy's poop.  I refuse to be one of those people who think that dog poop will melt into the sidewalk after a certain period of time.  I also do not want to be blamed for starting the next Black Plague if dog poop could start a plague like that.<br /><br />In comes this `bags on board' bone thing stocked with bags for like $4.  I'm thinking, ""Well, $4 is less than the price of a Bacardi and Diet...why not?!""  Man.  I am not looking back.  For some reason, my puppy pooped her way through all 30 bags in a little over a week.  Good for her... I guess?  So I had to re-up.  I almost went with stuffing plastic grocery bags in the bone and then decided that $7 was worth 120 convenient poop bags.  They fit perfectly into the bone.  The bone is not bothersome on the leash.  And, most important, I never forget a bag!  I don't really care about the colors and I don't see a quality difference between these and the `regular' blue bags.  The bags are not super thick, but my fingers have not broken through the plastic and poop has not come through the plastic.<br /><br />I am conscious of the destruction waste causes.  I do recycle.  I do wish that these were biodegradable.  But, instead of collecting the big grocery bag plastic bags, I am going to use these smaller bags for poop and my cloth bags for groceries.  Right now, the bags are a little big for my puppy, but I am sure she will grow into them...gross. TL;DR Picking up poop made easy"
"This was not available in any local stores, so I got  the 18 boxes , planning to share it with friends. I tried making the Jello  with pineapple juice as the cold liquid and adding pineapple chunks after it started to harden. YUMMY! It actually tastes like pineapple and coconut. The colada Jello is a slightly different texture than regular Jello --less ""gelatiny"" and more creamy. Made with just plain water,  this still tastes of coconut and pineapple. I understand you can make it with bottled pina colada mix --that would be fun for a party, especially if it had a few maraschino cherries and a bit of rum . TL;DR Pina Colada dessert"
"I was so hoping you had this tea online. I had sipped it at a seminar in S.Fe.,NM<br />I really appreciate its flavor and appreciate that you offer it. It was also<br />delivered in a very timely manner. I will continue to enjoy this product and order<br />it from you. TL;DR Relaxed Tea"
"My husband and I both enjoy this product.  We usually have it a couple of times a month and use it on chicken.  Just follow the dirctions on the package which is very simple.  While it's baking in the oven, fix some rice and a quick vegetable.  Dinner is served.  If you use boneless chicken, watch your baking time.  Very tasty product and Amazon has it at an excellent price. TL;DR Good and spicy"
"These premo treats are getting harder to find locally, and the dog loves them. Supplier got them to us fast with a great price. The product is good for large dogs and smaller dogs, but probably not under 20 lbs.; the treat size might be too generous for little guys.<br /><br />Big dogs love the great portion size. Both treats for small and large dogs are appropriate for most dogs. Large treats are especially grand for big dogs since many treats on the market rarely meet their requirements for  satisfaction. One large Scooby Snack will be very well received by the biggest dogs, saving you $$$. TL;DR Great price, really fast"
"I just ordered this and made my kids (and waffle lovers) the most delicious GF waffles.  We've tried so many mixes and most of them are good albeit a little grainy.  Not Pamela's!  There is no graininess at all, just a delicious texture that no one would recognize as gluten free.  Can't wait to try this mix to make scones for my hubs this weekend.  The Pamela's website has TONS of recipes that use this mix as a base. TL;DR Best GF Waffles Ever!"
"It is very disappointing for a caffeinated coffee drinker to receive decaf coffee when the website states that you will, in fact, receive CAFFEINATED varieties only.  I also received iced coffee (which was also not stated).  Your website needs to address this concern or you need to adjust your assortment to reflect this.  Other companies who mix K Cup assortments will do a caffeinated and decaf option, you should consider this and assure your customers are receiving what you are trying to sell.<br /><br />I did, although, receive only 1 of each flavor (which was very good in terms of variety).<br /><br />***UPDATE- I e-mailed Amazon customer service to let them know of the decaf issue and they were very quick to addressing my concerns.  Please post back if you receive decaf, as this was a very nice assortment otherwise and I would be interested in purchasing if they can address this problem*** TL;DR Not all caffeinated, and no where does it say you will receive decaf products"
"If you have a sensitive tummy and like coffee, but have to take a prilosec every time you want to enjoy it, then this coffee is for you!!! It tastes great, similar to other store bought coffees, yet it doesn't cause your stomach to get mad at you. Give it a go. TL;DR nice taste and low acidity"
"This is my everyday coffee now.  The roast is dark, just how I like it.  I would invest in a separate container to store it and keep it fresh if you don't drink at least a pot of coffee per day. TL;DR Great coffee."
This is black tea. This is not green tea. What a rip-off. Stay away from this tea. It is cheap for a reason. Really misleading advertisement - this tea is neither green nor caffeine free.<br /><br />Stick with Japanese green tea.<br />Following are excellent green tea<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FNJ7SS/ref=oh_o00_s00_i02_details<br />http://www.amazon.com/Kirkland-Signature-Matcha-Japanese-Leaves/dp/B000WB1YSE/ref=pd_bxgy_gro_text_b<br /><br />followed by<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TIYVPK/ref=wms_ohs_product<br /><br />Following is not bad but not as good as the above<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XUJ4BK/ref=wms_ohs_product TL;DR This not not Green Tea - Stay Away
"This is my first experience making sticky rice so I have nothing to compare to.  But I'm happy with the quality and taste.  I found a recipe online on how to make sticky rice with mango (I always crave this dessert when we go to Thai restaurants) and it was easy peasy with this rice.  Just put a cup of rice in a bowl, add enough water to go 10% above the rice line, cover with a dish, stick in microwave for 3 minutes, remove & mix, microwave again for 3 minutes, remove & mix, continue to microwave for 3 minutes until the rice becomes translucent.  Voila!  Perfect sticky rice.  To make the coconut sauce, just boil coconut milk and add some sugar to taste (I use honey).  Pour over sticky rice and add mango.  I will never order sticky rice with mango at a restaurant again! TL;DR Yum!"
"Well, it's a steak sauce, so what's to say?  I've always like Heinz 57 for its tart and complex taste, but some people might not, so it's subjective (surprise!).  I'll say that this deal (4 x 20 ounce bottles) for around $22 is a great price.  My local grocery stores charge about $5-6 for ONE 10 ounce bottle.  If it takes you a long time to go through 4 large bottles, give one away to a friend who shares your taste.  You'll still come out ahead! TL;DR Delicious!  Great price as well"
These would have been a lot better if they hadn't coated them in splenda. Bleh I wish that it was clearly printed on the front of this product that it contained sucralose and I would have chosen another flavor. That's something I feel should be clearly printed on the front of the label and not hidden in the ingredients list on the back. I do not eat sucralose because it causes my eczema to flair and I feel that if it's doing that then it must be causing some sort if harm in my body. I do NOT like not having it clearly stated that this product contains it.<br /><br />****update**** 10/26/2011<br />I changed my stars (from 1-3) even though I still think the sucralose (splenda) should be labeled better but because the person I gave them to really enjoys them. So if you able and willing to eat sucralose that this product maybe worth a try for you. TL;DR Way to much splenda on these.
"I purchased a can of Roland mackerel in soy oil at my local grocery store, and found within delicious small (like large sardines) fish. On that basis I ordered this item from Amazon. The fish in these cans is much larger: each can contains just part of single fish. The flavor is fine but my concern is that these are king mackerel, which are less healthy for your diet than other species (as you can check yourself with an Internet search). There is less omega-3 and, probably more importantly, likely to be more of the man-made pollutants that accumulate in larger fish. Of course the real solution is that we stop polluting the oceans so badly! But until that happens, I will prefer to eat smaller fish. TL;DR not the healthiest mackerel?"
"This is a fantastic tea.  The company always ships very quickly and the orders are accurate.  I now have several of these tins though, and I wish they'd offer just the bag refill for the tin. TL;DR Very Good Tea - Wish they had refills for the tin"
We were recommended to use this formula due to severe food allergies to my 5 month old son. His spit-ups stopped after using this and stools also became better. TL;DR Expensive formula - but it works
"Ordered Venus Flytraps and a Sundew for my son. Everything arrived in good shape with good shape with thorough instructions on how to plant the little guys. The plants were SMALL, but healthy. Excellent pre and post-delivery service from Joel's. Would highly recommend this company. TL;DR Great Plants, Great Service"
"the label gives misleading low calorie info by giving it for a third of a bar; barely any taste (a little vanilla might help);AND MOST IMPORTANT -- ALMOST NO PISTACHIOS!!!<br />At almost $1.50 a bar, this unacceptable! TL;DR where are the pistachios? where is the flavor?"
I loved the Panettone :)  Made french toast with it for Christmas dinner and it was the perfect of amount of sweetness. TL;DR Great product
"We have purchased many gluten free products for my husband, who suffers from gluten alergies.  Most have tasted like sand, being very gritty and bland.  Deboles is one of the best!  All of their corn products have a great consistency and taste.  Purchasing through Amazon is the best deal around.  Yes, you have to purchase in packs of 12, but the price makes it worth it.  Our son has a 15% chance of developing the same allergy.  Therefore, we cut out as much gluten from his diet as possible.  This is an inexpensive way to get him on the right course. TL;DR Great product for the gluten free diet"
I enjoy this coffee after dinner with good cake or pie. Make that chocolate cake with chocolate frosting and you really have a treat. TL;DR Pretty Good With Chocolate Cake
"Good Product, As Advertised - You might consider soaking for a day as the ham is very salty. TL;DR Good Product."
"I tried these after reading several reviews (including some mention in reviews of other brands of wasabi peas).  I was not impressed.  While not terrible, they didn't seem to have a lot of wasabi flavor, I could eat a handful without noticing, and they seemed much higher in calories than some other brands I've tried.  Do yourself a favor and give these a pass. TL;DR Adequate, but not great."
"I had my first ramen noodles when I was about 12.  A family from down south moved close by and I became friends with their son.  One night I had dinner with them and unknowingly was eating ramen noodles (we called them worms).  They were the super cheap kind you'd find in most American stores.  That night was also the first (and only) time I'd eaten ribs, which was a traumatic experience (I hated bones in my food).  I didn't really eat ramen much until late high school and college years after that.  I still only knew this as worm noodles until I started buying my own food.  That's when I learned what ramen really was.  I really enjoyed the stuff Campbell's or whoever had with the line of baked ramen.  I ate that stuff like crazy.  Today, I'm a vegetarian so much of the ramen in stores is not for me.  I used to buy the mushroom kind just for the noodles and instead of using the sodium packet I'd put a little butter and dash of salt and pepper.  But I haven't really done that since the baked ramen was discontinued.  The other day I decided to search Amazon for vegetarian ramen and discovered this stuff from Koyo.  I wasn't familiar with the company but the reviews were decent.  I especially liked the part of being vegetarian friendly.  So I bought a case and was eager for its arrival.  The first thing I noticed was the nutritional label.  There was only 193 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 0.5 gram saturated fat in a brick of noodles.  I was surprised because I was expecting something like 6 to 8 grams of fat like the stuff on most supermarket shelves.  I also noticed it said it was a product of China but then realize I was eating ramen after all.  That's like not buying Mandarin orange because they're from China.  I had my first bowl of it which I used half of a packet of flavoring with.  It was very good and I was happy.  I've since been altering between the half of a seasoning packet (which is loaded with sodium just like the cheap ramen) or the butter/salt/pepper mix.  I prefer the latter but the former is no doubt good too.  I wasn't half way through that first box of Koyo ramen before I had three more cases on the way.  Now my cabinets are stocked full of Koyo ramen. TL;DR Surprising Nutrition Numbers"
"My dad got an assortment of these to give as a silly little Christmas gift for us (we are adults now).  I really wasn't expecting much from them, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavors are mild, but good tasting and not sickly sweet.  Similarly, the carbonation turns out to have a pleasant effect rather than the gut-busting feeling you get from drinking soda.  I was also happy to see that it is sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar or aspartame.  The only drawback is the sodium content (contained in the compounds that create the carbonation.)  One other thing to note is that one tablet is for 6 ounces of water, so you will likely need to use 2 or 3 tablets for a ""normal"" glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say that if you are a soda drinker, you will find these disappointing since the flavors and carbonation are mild.  However, as an alternative to Crystal Lite, Kool-Ade (which I can't stand) or plain water, these are fun and make a good drink. TL;DR Fun alternative to soda, water, Crystal Lite, or Kool-Ade"
"Here is one product that seems to have been left unmodified for generations.  This is a review of HOENY MAID FRESH STACKS HONEY GRAHAMS.  The product consists of a total 345 grams of graham cracker.  This is about one third of a kilogram.  To provide some perspective, the typical adult in America weighs about 65 kilograms.<br /><br />The crackers come in a box, and in the box are six envelopes, each envelope containing 8 square-shaped graham crackers.  The American consumer, and perhaps people in Europe, might be more used to graham crackers that are rectangular shape.  Apparently, the goal of using only 1/2 crackers that are square, instead of full-crackers that are rectangular, are to extend freshness, for those who only eat graham crackers once in a while.  Yet another reason for this new packaging is likely to prevent breakage, that might occur with the traditional rectangular crackers, during transportation.<br /><br />But a more likely reason is to allow people to take individual servings with them, perhaps on trips, to school, or to work, with the confidence that the crackers will be kept safe, secure, and intact.  In my opinion, and perhaps those of others, one serving amounts to 8 crackers.  Thus, the great benefit of the HONEY MAIN FRESH STACKS product is not really ""freshness,"" but ease in packing an individual serving for school or trips.<br /><br />Now for the good part.  The crackers taste just the same as they have for generations, at least to this palette.  When I opened one package, I got the whiff of vanilla.  Or anyway, it was a pleasant aroma.  The color is light brown, perhaps the color of your favorite puppy, or perhaps the color of a stone formation at one of the National Parks in Utah.  The flavor is graham flavor.  The texture of this product is on the soft side.  Compared to another type of cracker, for example, SALTINES, the HONEY MAID graham crackers are softer and less cracky.  To conclude, I would not characterize this food as ""an adventure,"" but I might be tempted to call the HONEY MAIN graham cracker, addictive.<br /><br />According to a well known source (Wikipedia), Graham flour is a type of whole wheat flour named after the American Presbyterian minister Rev. Sylvester Graham (1794-1851), an early advocate for dietary reform.  Graham despised processed white flour and believed that bran was the cure-all for the bad eating habits of his compatriots.<br />Rather than simply grinding the whole grain wheat kernel (bran, germ, and endosperm), in graham flour the components are ground separately. The endosperm is ground finely, initially creating white flour. The bran and germ are ground coarsely. The two parts are then mixed back together, creating a coarse-textured flour that bakes and keeps well. Graham flour is used to make graham crackers and pie crusts, among other things.  It should be noted that the nutritional label on the HONEY MAID box clearly reads, ""graham flour."" TL;DR These are your grandfather's graham crackers."
"Our 18 year old cat is on its last legs, but polishes off a can or two per day of the Chicken & Liver Pate (with the few teeth he still has). TL;DR Good diet for older cat"
"Now that I have found nirvana in the form of red licorice, there is no reason to keep trying other brands.  The texture is completely satisfying, the way the log gives way to soft chewy goodness, the way the hint of slightly sour essence of pure raspberry rises to the top.  Unlike other high end licorice I've tried, there are no artificial colors like Kookaburra, and the texture is so much more RIGHT than Panda (which has more of a sticky wheat-type texture and less berry flavor).  I'm sold on this form of life pleasure. TL;DR Stop Looking: You are THERE"
"Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Apples 4oz Size<br />This is a great product and flavor. It's basic, almost every baby I know loves apples and the size is so much better because it's just big enough. On the rare occasion that my son or daughter can't/couldn't finish in one sitting I could put it in the fridge until the next time they sat down to eat. The price is great too, especially if you sign up for a subscription. I like it because if I need another set sooner than it would normally ship I can alter that in my subscription listing. It makes this a great value and a great product. TL;DR Best Baby Food by Far and the Best Flavor!!!"
"I find this to be a good product...good spicy flavor and a quick start to an easy meal.  I have since seen this same product, same quantity at my local Costco for a significant amount less. ($10.00 for a case of 12)  I thought that Amazon was supposed to be a good deal???? TL;DR Too expensive"
"We eat a lot of chicken breast in our house.  Chicken, chicken, chicken can get boring.  I love to mix things up with spices and seasonings.  This lemon pepper rub is great on chicken and fish.  Spicy, tangy, yummy.<br /><br />My only complaint is the jar: wish the lid was easier to get off with one hand while the other hand is covered in chicken juice. TL;DR Great Rub For Chicken/Fish"
"This is one of the best K-cup coffees I've ever had!  It's has a nice aroma, smooth, and rich cup of coffee; love it in the morning. TL;DR good cuppa coffee"
Was my first time purchasing this rice. I thought the jars would be bigger but then again I'm used to shopping at those big club stores. lol . I made some Mexican Rice Pudding with this rice and it came out so smooth and creamy. Just excellent. I was overall satisfied with my purchase. Was delivered quickly. TL;DR Very Good
"Kind of hard to find a complaint about this blend...if you like crisp roasted almonds, big and chewy cherries, pistachios, raisins, and cranberries, then you will love this mix.  There are lots of everything, it all tastes fresh (well, as fresh as dehydrated fruit can taste...) and no sodium.  Even the pistachios, which often tend to get a bit soft in mixes like this, are still fairly crunchy.  And, with the subscribe and save, the price is pretty reasonable for this quality mix.  I've had a similar mix from Trader Joe's (that one had chocolate chips as well), and I think this one is superior. TL;DR Great stuff!"
"Newman's is hard to find because everybody has discovered organic. They have also discovered that buying from a company that makes it's own food is safer than a company that just labels whatever another company makes for them.<br /><br />Newman's and a few others make and distribute their own food.<br /><br />Therefore, they are very careful what they put in each bag and can.<br /><br />I have been using Newman's Own for several years because it is organic for the most part and the rest of the ingredients are ""human quality"". They also do not use wheat gluten or rice protein. They do use flaxseed, kelp and sea salt among other healthful, tasty ingredients.<br /><br />The price is reasonable for organic food, and my two girls love it. TL;DR Newman's is hard to find!"
This tea is to tea like single malt scotch is to whiskey. It is the smoothest tastiest tea you can buy TL;DR Fine tea
"I decided to try this product after having previously bought the Nylabone Pro Action Dental Dog Chew with great results.  I must say, so far so good.  Although you are not given a choice to choose which dinosaur shape, my beagle/jack russell mix does not mind and loves her new stegosaurus!  Previous like products last about 2-3 months with the little dogs constant chewing and the occasional chomping from my Basset Hound. TL;DR Little Dog, Big Chewer"
This product looked absolutely nothing like the picture. Both in presentation and actual product. The fruit did not appear fresh and they were sparse. The basket was basically filler. I was with the receiver when this arrived and I was embrassed to have sent this to her. TL;DR Embrassed to have sent this
"I'm into eating healthy, but I didn't expect these chips to taste this good, and be Healthy!! WOW.<br /><br /> A hint of Garlic, and just enough salt, to draw you back, to take another, and another etc. I did't taste the Olive taste as much as others did, but I would buy these when I see them at my Store.<br /><br />They are crispy, and would be great for a dip, or just eat them as a snack.<br />Good in a child lunch bag, then the fried high fat other chips.<br /><br />No Trans fat, no chols, no preservatives, No GMO, no fake coloring or fake Flavorings.<br /><br /> One oz. Serving:<br />140 Cal. Sat fat 0.5.. no sugar, sodium 80mg. Carbs 18g, Protien 2g<br /><br />Two thumbs up. TL;DR Very good, and Healthy"
"This is the best hot chocolate ever!  Low calories, fat & carbs.  Mix it with fat free cream and it is truly out of this world! TL;DR Best hot chocolate ever!"
"These taste like regular rice krispies but sweeter, they are good, but actually a little too sweet for me (which I thought was impossible). There is no visible frosting on the cereal, it looks like a normal rice krispie but when you eat it, it's much much sweeter. The taste is great. The frosting taste is like Frosted Flakes. I also don't like how the cereal gets soggy so quickly in milk. Also, don't buy this expecting it to taste like Rice krispie treats cereal. TL;DR Good -- Not perfect"
"The tea is alright. not much flavor to it. only problem i had with this brand is the tea bags were very cheaply made. the string came off almost every bag when i was dunking it a few times. not buying this again. TL;DR Decent tea, poorly made teabags"
"We tried this sauce because we love the raspberry sauce served on so many desserts in restaurants these days. We had used another brand before but could no longer find it, so we searched the Internet and found this one. Unfortunately, it was more of an excessively sweet jam/jelly than a smooth sauce. One taste and no one would eat it. I tried using it in smoothies and it made the whole thing too sweet, even though I didn't add any other sweetener.<br /><br />If anyone knows a good raspberry sauce, please let me know! TL;DR Disappointing"
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>One reviewer smartly pointed out that the water source that this company uses is ""municipal water."" That's tap water. Before you think negatively of that, consider that they then put it through the reverse osmosis process and add the ingredients that I mention in the video.<br /><br />More importantly, since it's bottled in Bothell, Washington, you can be assured that their municipal water is outstanding - practically spring water.<br /><br />The fact that it tastes just like nice water isn't surprising. It would be worrisome if it didn't taste like water! TL;DR 1.5 liters of tasty healthy water"
"Goji berries CAN be very tasty and enjoyable, however this is not how I would describe Navitas goji berries.<br /><br />I bought a bag once, from Amazon, and found the berries to be nearly rock hard and absolutely dry.  The only good part about it was that they sorta tasted ok after chewing on them a while.<br /><br />If you want really, really good goji berries get Heaven Mountain brand.<br /><br />They cost twice as much as these, but these aren't really worth anything, in my opinion.<br /><br />These are the best and well worth the price:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010EBEKU"">Bija  Heaven Mountain Goji Berries 8-Ounces</a><br /><br />Do it right or don't do it! TL;DR Navitas: worst goji berries I've ever had"
"This is a hard product to find, but the taste is amazing and kids and grown ups all love it!  I usually order it online by the case, but I'm having a hard time finding it lately. TL;DR Amazing Taste!"
"As with other reviewers, this cereal was part of my childhood, and it ruined any other dry cereal for me forever.<br /><br />The chewy raisins are infinitely better than the soft gummy ones in other raisin brans (and there is the PERFECT amount of raisins! It is cereal with raisins in it, not half raisins and half cereal like some I've eaten), and the wonderfully tasty flakes (whole kernel, double-toasted REAL wheat flakes; not a paste molded into the shape of flakes) stay crunchy-to-al dente until it's eaten.<br /><br />I can only find it locally at my health food store under the name Erewhon Raisin Bran, but it's the same thing.<br /><br />[And re: the couple of ""Yuck"" reviews. They remind me of the time I was visiting a daughter in Florida and decided to make my 10 year-old grandson some chocolate pudding, his favorite thing in the world.<br /><br />I made it from scratch with whole milk, fresh eggs, excellent chocolate, Madagascar Bourbon vanilla, a knob of butter.  I had it cooled in little individual custard cups when he got home from school and proudly sat one of them on the table for him.<br /><br />He took a spoonful and his face fell.  Stunned, I said, ""What's the matter?  Don't you like it?""<br /><br />He said as politely as he knew how, ""It just doesn't taste like  REAL pudding....""  (""Real"" pudding being the little Jello cups in the 6-pack: only kind of chocolate pudding he'd ever had.)  Enough said.]<br /><br />The muffins you can make with this cereal are w/o doubt the best bran muffins I've ever eaten and everyone who tries them says the very same thing.  Here's the original recipe my mother made for us kids with back in the 1940s and I make for my grandchildren today. I'm never without the batter in the fridge. (The recipe given on the Erewhon website is the chic low-fat kind of thing that tastes like dry lawnmower clippings.)<br /><br />1 15 oz. box Skinner's/Uncle Sam/Erewhon Raisin Bran<br />3 C. sugar<br />5 C. all-purpose flour<br />5 tsp. baking soda<br />2 tsp. salt<br />1 qt. buttermilk<br />4 eggs, beaten<br />1 C. veg. oil<br /><br />In BIG bowl, dump all together in the order given (Oil last, at any rate). Stir well. Batter will keep tightly covered in fridge for up to 6 weeks, so you can bake up just what you need. (Makes about 3 1/2 qts. of batter, 50-60 muffins with a slightly rounded 1/4 cup ice cream scoop. I wouldn't try to make giant muffins with this heavy batter. They might overbrown before the middle cooks.)<br /><br />Bake in buttered muffin tin in pre-heated 400 degree oven for 12-14 minutes, lower the temp to 375 for another 5-6 minutes till light golden brown. Run a knife around each muffin and flip on the side so the bottoms don't get soggy.<br /><br />(Don't try to gussie up with vanilla extract, cinnamon, etc.  You won't believe the richness of the flavor, esp. if you'll make it a day ahead and let the malty bran flavor permeate the batter.) TL;DR The only dry cereal I've ever loved!"
"Easy to use & since it is low sodium, you can add whatever you want to it.  Good in soups and/or main dishes.  Taste is not overpowering. TL;DR Seasoning"
"An outstanding product, reasonably priced and the shipping was very prompt! I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality cheese at an affordable price. TL;DR Technodog"
"In general I have found most gluten free mixes to be expensive and not worth eating, so this cake was a delightful surprise. I am so pleased that Betty Crocker has a gluten free line, because I grew up with Betty, and it is nice to have an old friend on hand in my pantry. The taste and texture are really very good, and it is just as good as if I had made it from scratch. I didn't care for the yellow cake mix, so I was apprehensive about this one, but I needn't have worried. This makes a superior product, and the price is excellent.  I love this so much that I have multiple boxes on my pantry shelf for those times when I want something good and I want it fast. This one does very nicely.  I can't thank General Mills enough for this product line; it is easy, fast, good, and so much more affordable than many of the other brands. This tastes so much better than any of those other brands and I will always keep a case on hand.  I still bake a lot of things from scratch, but this mix is for the times when I don't have the time or patience to throw one together, or for last minute occasions that arise, when you need a dessert, and you need it quickly.  Definitely one of the best products there is. Betty is the other woman in my husband's life.  He can eat anything he wants, and has no allergies, but he loves the Bettys to distraction. Try this one, you will too. TL;DR As Good As Made From Scratch"
"I love this gum. In fact, I chew it all day.  I was happy to discover it packed in a plastic container.  Hated to waste all that paper having it individually.<br />I priced it a local store, though, and found it much cheaper to buy. TL;DR great gum, but overpriced on line"
"This is a great cup of tea. Oddly, better with sugar than with honey. Powerful vanilla flavor. My kids, who are not big tea drinkers, love it, too. TL;DR Great tea"
"That's about all you can say. This has a bit of a bitter aftertaste and I wouldn't recommend eating more than a TEENSY bit at a time to keep it from getting sickening, but it's not downright disgusting--and overall it's worth it to swap out the crazily unhealthy real marshmallow dips/spreads out there! TL;DR Decent, I guess."
"I thought I would give these a try since the nespresso caps are so tasty hence we go thru them quickly. Thought I would try a knock off for half the price. NOT worth it! Stick with the real thing or try another alternative because these are WEAK, WATERY and YUCKY. Maybe if I was try to ween myself off a nespresso habit but I am not so I do not enjoy them at all. :(<br />I tried the 3 strongest options and they were all week. Had to do short pulls and a 3:1 ratio was still not equal to 1 weak nespresso cap.<br />The shipping and service was great, just not the product. Plus to add insult, they dropped the price from 25$ a box down to 10$. At $10 try them yourself and you can taste disappointing brown water too! TL;DR yuck"
"I use this for popping popcorn. It adds a great little flavor to it. WAY better than corn oil. I just add a little salt. I tried using it as a rub as well. It is one of the best rubs I've ever made. I had to heat the mixture 1st though because the oil gets hard when cooled. It's tough to work with in the beginning, but it's worth it! TL;DR I can't eat popcorn without it anymore"
"It used to be a big challenge to get my dog to eat the hard chews, especially when he was stressed from traveling or around other dogs. Now his supplement is his favorite treat, which has removed a small but daily hassle from my routine. I balked at the price initially, but it's definitely worth the cost for me. TL;DR A big improvement over hard chews"
"When i first saw this I was like ""hey! perfect for a college student!"" No, it wasn't. It tastes awful, smells awful and it's gummy and gross. Don't eat this. Seriously. I'm very much more willing to wait longer for much better flavor. TL;DR Plain Awful"
I was looking for bulk pixie stix in little packages to give out for halloween. The picture shows a box of individual packages which is what I thought I was getting. What I received was a tiny bag of 48 individual little pixie sticks. I can pick up a bag at the store here for a couple of bucks. Very misleading (and I'm sure deliberately misleading) picture. TL;DR Buyer Beware
I love being able to send these to my son at college!  He loves the surprise package and I dont have to go to the post office.  Just click and it ships directly to HIM AT SCHOOL.<br /><br />Love that! TL;DR What can you say bad about Gummi bears?
"Makes a quick and tasty hot ginger tea.  I would enjoy it more with about half the sweetness, but that doesn't stop me from drinking it a couple times a day.  One packet could make 2 small cups.  If you don't like ginger, don't bother.  Will also dissolve in cold water, with a bit of shaking, if you prefer. TL;DR For ginger lovers"
The casings are very good and the product was shipped quickly. With sausage casing difficult to find locally at times its nice to have a reliable source. TL;DR quick service good product
"This product is evidently produced in Canada, probably in New Brunswick, from wild herring harvested in or about the Bay of Fundy or the Gulf of Maine.<br /><br />The herring are filleted and then lightly smoked before canning. The result is a delicious, healthy and wholesome<br />food item that mates well with warm, crusty French bread or multi-grain crackers. Highly recommended. TL;DR If you like fish.............."
"See my review also for the non-diet version.<br /><br />This taste a lot like the regular, perhaps I'd say it tastes like the original minus some brown sugar.  Definately drinkable, smooth, and doesn't have a sharp chemically taste.<br /><br />Great as a Diet Vernor's Float! TL;DR great diet soda, great ginger taste"
"I've purchased these Bitz in 20# boxes twice.  I have a large pack of dogs and also work with a rescue group.  These bite sized treats are perfect for training rewards or as 'just because' treats.  The size is appropriate for the smallest to the largest dog.  The quality is good.  The dogs seem to enjoy them.  The price is right in the 20# boxes.  The only down-side to these purchases was that on both occasions, the large plastic bag that contains the treats was not closed with a twist tie or anything of the sort.  It could have been a major mess and I would guess that the treats would have stayed fresher. TL;DR Perfect size for training treats"
Tried the Vanilla Cashews first...then went for the Pecans...wow! Fantastic product...I bought two cases and am glad I did. It's a flavor explosion in your mouth that you don't expect and it's a very healthy snack. TL;DR Better than Expected!!!!
"If you're a dark chocolate fan, you'll love these little treats.  I melt the chocolate on my tongue, then enjoy the sweet taste of the blueberry for a minute or two.  The inside is the consistency of a Jelly Tot, but with a yummy chocolate coating instead of plain sugar. WalMart has them.  Try it, you'll like it! TL;DR Little pieces of heaven!"
The Twinings English Breakfast Tea has long been on of my favorite teas. It is so convenient in the tea bags when you are in a hurry and does not sacrifice the good taste of fresh brewed tea. I am glad that Amazon is carrying the large boxes with 50 teas bags at a very good price and it qualifies for free shipping. TL;DR Good buy on tea
"These rye chips are not for people with brittle teeth or sensitive gums:  they are very crisp.  The rye chips are a great snack for a taste and texture that is something different from potato/tortilla chips, pretzels, crackers, puffs, etc.  I see that the price has more than doubled since I ordered them:  I hope that this price doesn't remain:  I would like to order these rye chips again, but not at this price. TL;DR Crunchy & Flavorful"
"The best part of these bags is that they stack very well horizontally (unlike the Medella bags we used to use), which saves freezer space and allows the  milk to thaw quicker. They also are very secure and can hold a large amount of milk. The price compared to other products is a bonus! TL;DR Great Bags!"
"These bread sticks, like every other Schar product that I have tried, are excellent.  taste is suberb (who would know that it is gluten-free?)  There is a little problem with product breakage, but not significant. TL;DR another Schar success"
"We've been using Kelly's Delight since the early days and love this product.  It's fantastic for ice tea drinkers because it dissolves in cold tea.  But we love it in recipes, in drinks and so many ways. TL;DR Fantastic Alternative to dry sugar"
"This is a good coffee, not great but good. It isn't jamaican Blue mountain it is a ""Blend"". When they use the title ""blend"" for coffee it usually means its 10% or less of the type of coffee. Thhis is 10% jamaican and 90% something else, Hence the price is much lower. Like i said a good coffee but doesn't compare to the real JBM. Would i buy it again yes. Cheaper than the 100% by a long shot. TL;DR Only A blend"
"If you love those white chocolate mocha lattes at Starbucks, this is a nice substitute. Yes, you can go on ebay and order soon-to-be-expired gigantic bottles of the real deal, but it's so expensive that the savings over just going to Starbucks in the first place is negligible.<br /><br />Torani sauces and syrups are great in their own right. We use this with our Tassimo system (with both the latte/espresso discs and the cappuccino/espresso), and it's fantastic. If you're going for lattes, get this over the syrups as the consistency is much better. This stuff is great mixed into hot chocolate and over ice cream, as well. I've even made milkshakes with it. In fact, I've made so many things with this stuff that I think the next time, I'm going to have to go for the sugar free version! TL;DR Yummy stuff, good deal"
"Great flavor! I love that these apple chips come flavored, so many out there are bland and boring.  A chip should be salted or sugared or something and these are great! TL;DR Excellent Chips"
"We tried this a couple times, but we have a SUBSTANTIAL preference for the Kraft Bacon Ranch Pasta Salad.  It's the same idea as this, but for some reason the Betty Crocker Suddenly Salad gave our family upset stomachs both times we tried it.  In fact, my kids started calling it ""Suddenly something down your leg"", which is what it is known as to this day in our house.  The sad part is the Kraft version is MUCH harder to find, but definitely superior.  Check out the Kraft one - more delicious and less crampy results. TL;DR Beware of the ""Suddenly"" part"
"This is a great product that we have actually bought for a few years now, our cat really does enjoy this catnip and chases the enclosed mouse around for hours at a time. TL;DR Great product, Cat goes crazy and burns some energy"
"It's difficult to find several items in todays market if insufficient demand for them exists. My Wife and I have exhausted our normal sources for saccharin. Not even the drug stores carry it anymore.<br />Our Son suggested Amazon. I'm a real Dinosaur when it comes to anything electronic, but I got in to the Amazon website and it was so simple! The correct product; the correct brand name ( known to us as reliable) and best price we ever paid for this product!

TL;DR HARD TO FIND PRODUCTS"
"This item falls into the category of nice, but not totally necessary.  While it steams and purees in one cup resulting in fewer dirty dishes, if you already have a stove top steamer and a blender you can get the same results. TL;DR Nice, but not necessary"
"I purchased this formula but was worried after reading the comments here that my 5 month old baby would suffer from constipation.  He did.  However, I really wanted to use organic formula so I added a few teaspoons of prunes to his cereal and within 12 hours - problem solved.  No constipation since and he has been on this formula for about 2 weeks. I give him some prune/cereal every 4 days.  If your baby is not yet on solids you might consider giving him a little apple or pear juice mixed with water.  This should do the trick also.  Don't let the constipation issue scare you off. TL;DR If you're worried about consitpation...."
"I like this combination...good way to get the veggies in along with the fruit!<br /><br />The flavor (which sounds odd to an adult, I'll admit) went down with no complaints!  :-) TL;DR Nice combination"
"This duck rillettes is not from Perigord (France) as written in the title....but from Canada!!! Look at the tag on the jar. It says ""product of Canada"". TL;DR product made in Canada....not France!"
This coffee was a great value but after receiving the coffee and trying it I did not like the taste.  Some people probably like it but for myself the taste was not appealing so I gave the rest away to a friend.  I'll give it three stars for the value TL;DR I did not like
"I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle. For example, with the cream soda I had to use about half the recommended amount, but with the diet root beer I like to add more mix. The real thing with these flavors - you just have to try them. I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas. I am looking forward to trying some more of the exotic soda stream flavors (BBB has almost all of them in stock) and playing with making my own.<br /><br />3 stars because... well, win some, lose some with the flavors. It's all subject to taste. TL;DR Win some, lose some"
"Is yet another chocolate assortment, dont get me wrong its not bad at all, its just not the best. In other words you get what you pay for. TL;DR Not So Bad..."
"This is the best mayo on the market bar none. Made in the French fashion (after all, the French invented mayo), with oil, eggs, dijon, lemon, and vinegar. Worth every penny. TL;DR REAL mayonnaise like it's supposed to be made"
Great product. Good price. I will buy at this store again. Superb quality. I use it for baking paleo style. TL;DR Arrowroot Powder
my 4 dogs all had allergies and are just fine now that i switched to Wellness.. The fush one smell abit but .. they still love it ..Either the dried orthe canned r terrific flavors..WITH NOOO GRANI! TL;DR great food
It seems to be no more thirst quenching and refreshing than any other kind of gum.  I used to get a really dry throat when running so I thought I would give this a try.  It didn't help any more than regular gum - And costs a lot more. TL;DR Dissapointing
"Costco stopped carrying this near me, so when I found out it was on amazon for cheaper, I was so excited.<br /><br />It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I got from the Costco (no damage or anything). TL;DR Awesome price, good product"
At Whole Foods they sell a rice salad which I really like but it's $11 a pound !! so I decided to make it myself. That is how I became familiar with Lundberg Farms. This blend or Countrywild will do. Simply cook the rice as directed then stir in 1/4 cup of chopped pecans and 1/4 cup of golden raisins after removing the rice from the heat. Leave it covered for 10 minutes. It's delicious. TL;DR Here's my story
"I was excited to pop that first little chunk of Mo's Bacon Bar in and see what happened.  Well, lots of things happened.  The flavors were strong, yet subtle at the same time, which my confused my mind a little.  The smoked salt is brilliant if you can snag a piece of a good granule of that in it.  The bacon was really good, but it nearly blew it off the richness charts for my taste buds, anyway.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I think everyone should at least try one of these in their lifetime. It's a unique experience for sure or bring one to a friend's gathering (it WILL get attention and some talk).  Otherwise, this is something you'd have maybe once or twice a year or for a special occasion.  Trust me, if I ate one of these everyday - I'm not sure I'd make it past day three because they are RICH! TL;DR Interesting and rich, but not something you'd eat everyday"
"Before going gluten free, I LOVED corn bread. Couldn't get enough of the stuff, it was a meal in itself.<br /><br />So to try something different and something that required little effort, I picked a package of Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Cornbread mix up from the store yesterday. While making the cornbread mix was simple enough and baking the mix was easy, this bread just doesn't taste good.<br /><br />For those so starved for a piece of corn bread this will be okay. It's consistency isn't terrible and it does taste like corn bread. Just not tasty cornbread I want another piece of.<br /><br />I found slathering the bread with butter helped.<br /><br />2.5 stars out of 5 TL;DR Where are all these good reviews coming from?"
"The shell is good for cooking snail, but it was not well packed and I got some cracked shells I believe they were damaged during delivery. TL;DR Good quality, but so so package"
"Bought this soup based on a very strong recommendation from a friend.  The soup turned out average - not great, not bad, just average. TL;DR An average cup of soup"
you realy cant beat the deal on coffee they offer a great product at a great price it realy cant be beat the delivery was awesome we have made several orders and ty for the great job TL;DR awesome supplier
"I have looked for Peppercorns of this quality for some time, and am pleased to find it here on Amazon. I was particularly pleased with the packaging and the speed of shipment through USPS. The price was and is exceptional, and the product is as well. I will certainly be looking for more of this soon. TL;DR Black Peppercorns!"
"Just what I expected.  A good alternative to water.  Its not coconut milk, so don't expect a dessert drink or anything like that.  Think drinking straight fro the coconut itself.  I prefer it cold. TL;DR Good drink"
"I made a stir fry with it the day after receiving it in the mail and it was really rather good.  In fact usually when I made it with other sauces there was leftovers but this time everyone had seconds and even some thirds and finished it.<br /><br />The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was that you really can't taste any pineapple in it. I figured the pineapple would be subtle when I bought it but we couldn't notice it at all.  But even with this minor flaw it is good sauce.<br /><br />EDIT: I used this to marinade a roast and it came out really good.  First I took a knife and poked allot of holes in the top of the roast, put garlic cloves in the holes then rubbed the roast down with a cup of this sauce and let it sit in the fridge over night.  After cooking in the crockpot for 10 hours on low it was out of site.  Even my very picky eater of a mom came over and loved it.  In fact she came back over today for leftovers. TL;DR Very good Teriyaki Sauce"
"Simply put we are picky coffee drinkers who enjoy a nice dark roast coffee in the morning to get us going.  We take our coffee black, without any sweetness, so we know when the coffee is good & when it isn't worth drinking.  While this coffee is pleasantly balanced, without unwanted bitterness or acidity, it does lack some depth. Cafe Altura's Peruvian Dark Whole Bean coffee is not THE BEST coffee we have ever had, but it is a DARN GOOD cup!<br />We are happy to support, ""Organically Grown Under Shade Trees & Family Farm & Fair Trade Grown.""  We like it very much, indeed, enough to enjoy Amazon's subscribe & save feature.  Cheers! TL;DR ""solid coffee,"" from picky people"
"One of my cats weft through a negative personality change, so my vet put him on medication as well as recommended this product.  I have a pet fountain, not a water bowl, and I had used the human variety of Rescue Remedy in my pets' fountain before buying this one.  The human formulation caused no problems.  However, when I switched to the pet formulation, the results were disgusting.  I had cleaned the fountain thoroughly, motor and all, as well as placing a new filter inside it when I made the change between the two formulations: after a week I noticed what looked at first like some type of dirt around the rim, so I took it apart to clean it.  Once I took it apart it looked like it had never been cleaned! The filter was obviously new, but COVERED BY MOLD!  There was mold everywhere!  When I took the motor apart again, it looked like it had never been done!  EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE FOUNTAIN WAS FULL OF MOLD TO SOME DEGREE!  IT MAKES ME ILL TO THINK THAT MY PETS WERE DRINKING FROM IT IN THAT CONDITION!  IF YOU HAVE A PET FOUNTAIN, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT: USE THE HUMAN VARIETY!! TL;DR Not for pet fountains"
"I tried it and I think it's alright. I personally find the ""454 Horse Power"" to be much better. Kicking horse is still my preferred Brand of coffee on Amazon, always very fresh and oily. Go with 454, it's just all around better than this. TL;DR Not the best variety.."
"I always wanted a organic snack that tasted good. For me they the best, as they are organic, good tasting and reasonable price. I always bought them on sale at our local grocery, but that didn't happen too often. When I found them on Amazon, at a lower price, it was a no brainer to order them. I have my order set up to repeat on schedule, so I don't even have to take time to order. TL;DR Best tasting organic snack out there"
"It tasted great!  This is something I would eat daily even if it wasn't good for me.  The flavor is like no other.  Most protein bars have that gross powdery aftertaste, but not the Wheaties bars. I buy a bunch of bars on Monday, and keep them at my desk. TL;DR Delicious!"
"Received a coconut almond bar as a token gift, I loved it... so good it made me smile! I would like to order more but the $10.00 a bar +s/h is too pricey for me :( TL;DR Amazing...but too pricey!"
So glad these are available in the US. My English relatives used to send these over as Christmas gifts back in the day. That was how I got 'hooked'. Simply delicious and one is simply not enough. That includes the box. TL;DR Addictive
"The product arrived when predicted. The coffee pods make coffee with a good flavor, but the aroma isn't as rich as with regular coffee. TL;DR Baronet Coffee Decaf--It's Okay"
"I love stretch island fruit bars!  Our local Costco started carrying these a few years ago, for about the same price found on amazon. I quickly became attached to these delicious and healthful treats, and was very disappointed when Costco stopped carrying them. Amazon to the rescue, of course!<br /><br />Great for kids, no added sugars or bizarre ingredients, and try a few of these in lieu of an ""energy bar"" before strenuous exercise, along with a small handful of nuts...  Plenty of energy whatever the activity! TL;DR Delicious, healthful, and well-priced!"
"I just got my second box of this tea! Flavor-wise, it's not the most exciting tea I've had. I suppose I'd describe it as pleasantly earthy and mild, with no one ingredient especially strong. For a ""medicinal"" tea, however, I think unoffensive is good enough. I love it with honey.<br /><br />As for helping with colds, I can't say for sure, since a little relaxation with hot decaffeinated tea of any variety usually helps me feel better, but I do suspect this tea helps a bit more than others, both short-term, by relieving stuffiness, and it seems to reduce the overall duration of colds too. Whether it's really ""medicinal"" or it's just old fashioned ""plenty of rest and fluids"" doing the work, I'm superstitious enough about this tea that I won't let myself run out! TL;DR A cold and flu season must-have!"
AWESOME!!<br /><br />I use it for training only and cut it up into small pieces.  It is much better than the other dog food roll brand (Natural....something) which has SUGAR listed in the top 5 ingredients. REDBARN has NO SUGAR or SALT added....<br /><br />All the dogs in the training class LOVE this AND my dogs will do any tricks to get a little bit of this roll as a treat. TL;DR Dogs Love them in pieces for training treats
"NOTE: This review is based several uses. I don't use hair conditioner very often because it weighs down my hair, but I thought I would be fair and give this product a try.<br /><br />At first, the smell of the product coming through the bottle was strong and overly sweet. What surprised me was that it actually has a pleasant, not overpowering smell once you squeeze it out of the bottle.<br /><br />As for the cons, the texture is thick and feels like heavy lotion. This worried me, because as I mentioned before, certain conditioners weigh my hair down. I used a dime sized amount and coated the top and bottom parts of my hair with the product, then rinsed thoroughly. However, when I tried to dry my hair, I realized it still felt heavy with conditioner. I had to rinse for a few more minutes before I could try to dry and style again. A week later, I tried again, unfortunately to the same results.<br /><br />I can see how this can benefit other users. This conditioner, however, is definitely not for me. TL;DR Like Lotion for the Follicles"
"I have been using this cat food for about a month and I have purchased 3 flavors. Now, I'm not a cat, and I've never eaten it, but both my cats eat it right up. I have a 14 year-old cat with tiny kidneys, who was an outdoor cat until July, when I took her to the vet, and he gave her a 25% chance of still being alive in 2 years. He told me that I need to get her on good, wet cat food. So I bought this, after doing a lot of research. Since purchasing this, she seems to have filled back out (she's very tiny, maybe 4 pounds). She is also peeing a bit less, which is also a good sign that her overall urinary tract is working better.<br /><br />Another good sign for this food comes from my younger cat who is almost 2. I am feeding this to her, as well, and her solid waste has become much less stinky! She has had a VERY stinky litter box from the moment I got her. I've tried different foods (even mixing in some pumpkin, per a vet)to no avail, but since giving her this, her smell is not as strong.<br /><br />So, this is a little bit pricey compared to some foods, but well worth it for the health of my cats, and the sanity of my nose :) TL;DR Great Cat Food"
"this manuka honey is help me alot for my system, clear out my cought, and my allergy, also my hold family take it, it also help my child for eat TL;DR manuka honey"
Delivery was on time but when I opened the product it was like the shelf life expired.  They were hard and chewy. I contacted the manufactur and they sent out a new box. I will be ordering direct from now on. TL;DR Old
"I have ordered this product from this company twice now.  The first time no problems and I love the tea especially as it is decaf so can enjoy in the evening. But, the second time I ordered it they did not have enough to fill my order so sent me an email telling me to call them.  I have called several times and sent several emails NO RESPONSE, however they have charged my credit card.  I am very unhappy with this company. TL;DR Problem with company"
"The tuna is excellent quality with little extra liquid inside the can. Wish it was not so expensive, though. But you do get a good value for a high quality product. TL;DR High quality product"
"These are tasty and I am enjoying one with my morning coffee break while I write this, but reading the nutrition facts and the ingredients list on the package, I have to think that this is more of a tasty and somewhat healthy cookie than a substitute for breakfast. According to the package, a serving is four biscuits which adds up to 230 calories. Though that includes 3 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, it also includes 13 grams of sugar and 8 grams of fat.<br /><br />They are good, tasting like a nice butter cookie with just a hint of cinnamon and apple. Still, I think I'll be more likely to have one from time to time as a little treat with my morning coffee or after dinner than to substitute a package for breakfast. There I'd more likely chose a low-fat fruit yogurt which would have more than twice the protein, less sugar and fat, and less calories. TL;DR It's Really a Cookie!"
"Very dark chocolate. Very smooth chocolate. Very necessary chocolate. This is the type of chocolate that is as good for your heart as red wine. And it definitely does not hurt your feelings to eat it! We have developed the habit of eating 3-4 pieces after dinner in lieu of dessert. Since we've been doing the 17-day diet, this makes it bearable as well as adding the anti-oxidant and flavonoids that are important to health. It's such a great signal to ""end"" the day's eating, we seldom eat anything after that bit of Dove! BONUS: We've each lost about 20-25 lb in the 3 months we've been using this practice. TL;DR well......it's CHOCOLATE"
"I was very apprehensive about growing this wheat grass as it seemed quite complicated.  My intention was to grow the grass for my cats and dog.  I must say, I followed the directions implicitly and within one week the grass was tall enough to present to my animals!!  Today was the day and the cats seem to be eating it.  My dog doesn't seem interest----yet.  The kit includes everything you need with five growing pans.  I'm very happy with this product. TL;DR My cats like it!"
"Like two other Coffee Bean Direct teas that I've ordered, the Earl Grey has a great bargain price for good quality tea. I brew and refrigerate a gallon at a time. The amount of tea that I need to make a gallon seems smallish - I'd estimate a little over a cubic inch. The bag measures to 200 cubic inches so I'm estimating 12 cents a gallon plus or minus some. Now that is a bargain! Since the tea tastes great, it's a real bargain.<br /><br />The unique ingredient in Earl Grey is called ""oil of bergamot"" and that is what gives the tea its unique aroma though it only has a small effect on the taste. The aroma in the bag is really kicky so take a sniff and enjoy.<br /><br />The only minus on this tea is the amount shipped, 2 lbs, and the large volume: where you going to store it? I'm keeping it in the bag but that might let the tea get stale after a while. I'd be willing to pay a dollar or two more if the tea shipped in a resealable bag, probably metal instead of paper, that was designed for long-term storage. This consideration does not knock off a star since it's a bargain even if I had to throw half of it away. TL;DR Great Bargin - Good Tea"
"This cookie bar is a 100-calorie, 0 trans fat treat. Somewhat reminiscent of Fruit Newtons, they are crispy and quite tasty. They are somewhat dry, and tend to drop crumbs. Nonetheless, they are quite good for a 100-calorie treat, and nice to have around in the afternoon!<br /><br />(Review of Quaker Stila Blueberry Cookie Bar) TL;DR Quite good and nice to have around in the afternoon!"
The cookies are a great chocolate fix early in the morning. Delicious way to start the day. TL;DR Yummy breakfast.

Try the low sodium variety of Amy's Lentil Soup - then you can add the amount of salt needed, but not too much.  Sign up for Subscribe and Save to benefit even more! TL;DR Amy's Organic Lentil Soup"
"My dog, Blue, is about 85 pounds and 11 or 12 years old -- he loves me and follows me everywhere.  Over the last 3 or 4 years, he has slowed down and can't seem to get up as quickly as he used to or bound up the stairs after me.<br /><br />Based on a friend's recommendation, I started feeding Happy Hips to Blue -- about 6 a day -- he gobbles them up and seems to have a lift back in his steps.  I can tell when I have forgotten to give them to him.<br /><br />This is a great way to help out your aging 4-legged best friend. TL;DR Happy Hips are Great for Old Big Dogs!"
"My canine companion is a 132 pound, five year old, Shiloh Shepherd.  The Shiloh Shepherd is considered a 'giant breed.'  With his enormous size, athleticism, and the general nutrient demands, we all must consider, his diet has always been a primary consideration.  Not to mention, he has the sensitive tummy often seen among the German Shepherd breed.  His breeder has always been partial to 'Premium Edge Lamb.'  This is the formula he was weaned on.  I had no desire to change what appeared to be a successful regimen.<br /><br />Then to my dismay, I learned 'Premium Edge' was placed on a recent recall list.  I knew that a change in diet was likely to be detrimental to my fur friend, but I had to take immediate action.  And, at the time of recall, I didn't have time to gradually transition to a new diet, which is always the way to go, to avoid negative symptoms.<br /><br />After carefully analyzing formulas of numerous dry kibble, I opted to give Pinnacle (Trout & Sweet Potato) a try, ordering a 15 pound 'starter' bag from Amazon.  In addition, I ordered some digestive enzymes to assist in the transition phase.<br /><br />The bag arrived.  I opened it with my dog assisting to see what his response would be.  The first whiff out of the bag was strong, smelling of fish.  I noted the kibble size, itself, was quite small for a large breed dog, but felt this was only a minor reservation.  The ultimate test was not what I thought about it, but what my Shiloh would.  He immediately had a positive response.  In fact --- he loves it!  He appears more enthusiastic about it than the 'Premium Edge.'<br /><br />I had to start the Pinnacle before the enzymes arrived, so I was expecting some terrible gas and possibly some diarrhea.  Well, that was not the case.  He has gone through the 15 pound bag, and half of the next order --- a 30 pound bag, with no diarrhea, or gas, at all.  In fact, his stools appear firmer and more consistent than on his previous diet.  Supplementing with the enzymes was actually not necessary.<br /><br />I'm delighted with this new regimen.  I also love that I can order a 30 pound bag through Amazon and have it delivered to my front door.  I'm now avoiding a considerable drive,  and,  the back-breaking-discomfort, of lugging around heavy bags of kibble.<br /><br />My dog is happy, and I'm happy.  That said, after an adequate therapeutic trial, I feel confident in recommending Pinnacle. TL;DR My Shiloh loves it!"
"I have used Frontier dried herbs, etc. for over twenty years.  I did NOT realize until recently that I could buy them in bulk on Amazon.  I am very glad that I able to use the herbs from Frontier, + get them at a reasonable price when I order them in bulk. TL;DR AWESOME"
"The chips came quickly and they were fresh, but they really need more garlic and onion flavoring.  I probably won't order this again. TL;DR Disappointed"
"I had a craving for this while I was pregnant, and ate it almost every day. Th flavor is excellent, and true to the directions, it only takes 12 minutes to make. Use a nonstick pan, and keep it on a full boil just like it says. Worth every penny! You won't be dissapointed! TL;DR Excellent"
"If you love flavored coffees you will love this.  They do a nice job of delivering a noticeable vanilla flavor.  If you find the artificial aftertaste that most flavor coffees have unpleasant then you will probably not like this.  The smell is luscious and I think I would make it just for the smell alone. TL;DR Smell is luscious,I think I would make it just for the smell alone"
"I received the product very fast...and this is my second time ordering from them. The coffee is very good, roasted it perhaps Vienna roast just as the oil started to show. I will try a full city next time. I will order this coffee again. TL;DR Peru penachi"
it is exelent quality the schoko is so smoth and melts of the tung like creme it is better then any godiva truffel i payd an fortune for TL;DR better then godiva
I could not have been more pleased with the speed of delivery and the quality of this product. Have always loved 'good' dark chocolate and Toblerone really is tops in my book. Thanks for making it easy to send sweets to my sweet for Valentines Day. Great job! TL;DR Toblerone sweets!
"I love granola...in both bar and crumbled form.  So I jumped at the chance to try this Chocolate Delight Granola.  Long story short, it tastes great.  If you like chocolate and granola, you'll like this (that isn't really saying much is it).<br /><br />However, my major problem with granola of any kind is that it isn't particularly healthy.  Don't get me wrong...it isn't like going out and eating some lard enriched southern breakfast.  But it isn't very low on the calories either.  A single serving of this stuff is about 200 calories...and there are 8 servings per bag.  I don't know about any of you, but 1.5 ounces of tasty granola isn't going to be enough for me :)...especially since it comes in large pouch form.  Suffice it to say that this bag lasted me two morning drives to work...and 800 calories a morning is just a bit too much for me :/ TL;DR tasty, but not healthy"
Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website. TL;DR Not really olive juice
"The purpose of my review is simple:  Know that you are buying a coffee that is flavored.  It's 'chocolate glazed donut' flavored coffee.  I bought 48 of these thinking it was 'donut house' coffee.  Well, it is.  But what I didn't realize is that Donut House is apparently a brand, not a flavor.  The good news is that this flavored coffee doesn't completely suck.  Don't get me wrong, if you like 'Donut House' regular coffee, you probably won't like this flavor.  I don't.  But it's not their fault that I buy things on amazon without reading the fine print (or in this case, reading the primary description).  I will suffer through 'chocolate glazed donut' for the next 3-4 weeks so that I might learn this lesson:  Read the description of what you are buying!  Who would buy chocolate glazed donut coffee, anyway?  ;-) TL;DR Chocolate Glazed Donut!"
"I must say, I was not sure what to expect when ordering these.  I have been trying to stay on a low carb plan for a while, but the one thing I missed a lot was chips/crackers.  I have experimented with baking different things and even trying to fry up my own root vegetables.  Nothing really worked well.<br /><br />I stumbled on these one day and bought the Pizza flavor and the White cheddar.  They are both quite good, however, they are a bit TOO salty and that says a lot coming from a salt-a-holic like myself.  LOL.<br /><br />I have not checked yet to find out if they just have a ""plain"" cheese with none of the additional additives, but if they do I will try them next to see if the salt is lower.<br /><br />Oh, and you can barely eat a whole bag.  These are small bags, but they are rich.  I found that I only needed a small amount to satisfy that salty/crunchy craving.  So they will go pretty far I think.<br /><br />Would recommend for anyone trying to stay low carb. TL;DR Not bad for a salty crunchy low carb snack!"
"Even though I don't buy Pedigree food to feed my dogs, I do buy these treats for them. They go nuts just knowing they are getting one! TL;DR My dogs favorite treat!!!"
"This used to be the real great one in Northern Italian style espresso - half the price of Illy Normale, and more consistent.  But that's apparently all over now.  I have just had exactly the same experience as D. Cocco reports above.  The coffee was stale, and completely changed - way overbalanced toward one, particularly strong flavor.  I sent a respectful email to them about this, and received no reply.  It wasn't necessary to pay the premium price for imported Italian coffee anyway; it's just that this one was a particular favorite, so I'd spring for it once in a while.  But there are better choices, and for a lot less.  Dean's Beans, for instance. TL;DR End of Another Great Brand"
"Excellent service. Speedy delivery and perfectly as advertised. Thank you!<br /><br />It makes excellent bread. My son is gluten intolerant (self diagnosed) and we have found that if you adhere to the recipe on the back of the flour, the break comes out too hard and crumbly for him. We have added an extra teaspoon of yeast, and a half cup extra of liquid. The mixture rises much better now, leaves decent sized CO2 holes in the bread and is much more pliable. He says it now testes like real bread! That is what I call a result!<br /><br />I suggest you experiment with the ingredients until you find your ideal mixture! TL;DR Gluten Free Flour - wonderful!"
"This is THE BEST pizza crust.  Not just the best gluten free pizza crust, but the best pizza crust ever.  I followed the recipe that a previous reviewer gave (less liquid).  The only problem was that my veggie pizza the crust got a little soggy, but that's a problem I have with most crust, but the edges were still crunchy.  The pepperoni/olive was perfect, crust was thin and crisp, and of course oh so tasty. Can't wait to try it again, next time I'll grill the veggies to get out some of the moisture.  Namaste! TL;DR Big namaste to Namaste Pizza Crust Mix"
"I moved to the US from the UK almost 18 years ago and for a long time went without my beans on toast; that was until British stores popped up here and there but a 40 mile each way drive was not in the cards for me, not even for beans.  I then found a place about 12 miles away, but they charged the earth for them, then I found amazon carried them.  Ever since then I have them on a standing order for a case every 6 weeks.  I love my beans and for those of you not used to these, an excellent source of fiber, cheap meal addition, versatile, etc. LOVE EM. TL;DR Heinz Beans - The Best By Far"
"If you can get past the fact that this does not arrive in any form of a ""package"" with the picture that is shown your good!  If you are looking for a great assortment of flavors that would be impossible to get all on your own...then this is for you too.  I was very pleased with the assortment, and how fun to go through and pick your flavor to try each time.  I purchased this for myself since my huband is more loyal to only one plain flavor k-cup and I like variety. TL;DR Great price"
"MiO is a great little way to really up how much water I drink each day. I completely stopped sodas, because the mio, with ice cold water is far better. The peach tea for me is a 'sustainable' flavor. I drink it on a daily basis. The others are more 'in the mood' flavors for me. I really enjoy the blueberry pomegranate one as well. I went from drinking nearly no water to drinking 64+oz every day. I only add 1 squeeze to a 32oz bottle of water, as I like it mildly flavored. Lasts for a good week or more (3.99 for a weeks worth of flavored water, yay!)<br />The sweet ice tea flavor is one that you'll need double dosing of, as it tastes off when there's not a lot of it.<br /><br />And oh yeah. Chemicals, chmemicals. If you go from drinking SODA to the mio with water, you're still doing yourself a favor. TL;DR Handy and tasty way to UP your water intake."
"While these tea bags make a decent cup of tea, I wouldn't call it chai. It does not taste very spicy, nor does it have a very fragrant aroma. The only spices listed as ingredients are cinnamon, cardamom, ginger and cloves. Celestial Seasons India Spice Chai tea bags list those four spices, plus nutmeg, black pepper, Chinese star anise, chicory and vanilla bean, for a much better cup of chai. TL;DR A nice cuppa, but it's not Chai!"
"the tea has some strong weird taste, not like the fragrant jasmine tea I use to have.  Contacted seller since the product doesn't have an expiration date, but seller refuse to exchange. TL;DR Weird taste"
"Brought this as a gift, the receiver is still chuckling, and uses it on everything. TL;DR Wonderful......."
"I had purchased this assortment from Costco and of course they no longer carry it.  I tried several times to find this product, even e-mailed Hersheys.  They kept telling me this assortment was available at Krogers and Meijers, not at any of my stores.  The chocolate is awesome and each square is 45 calores.  What is not to love about that.  I would highly recommend this assortment if you love dark chocolate, there is nothing better.  Awesome! TL;DR Dark Chocolate Heaven"
"I haven't had licorice that tasted like this in years, and I still can't decide if that's a good thing. The Red 40 is a bit disconcerting, and the package can be frustratingly difficult to open (maybe that's good to curb cravings). Couldn't pass the price up as a gift for a licorice fanatic, but promptly cancelled the S&S subscription because halfway thru the 4lbs, we've had more than enough. They're addicting, but they just don't feel like food in your hands. TL;DR Dye, tough package, decent taste"
"I really like the crispness of the cracker.  I have to watch salt and since they have no salt, it makes it easier.  Mine always arrived with no broken crackers and arrive promptly and as promised.  I never have any problems with the crackers staying fresh.  I highly recomment these crackers.  I am always on the lookout for salt free or low salt foods.  Finding one that tastes so good is always a treat. TL;DR rice crackers"
"I LOVED these things!  They're my favorite flavor, and they make an excellent snack.  I tried the chocolate, and oddly enough, as much of a chocoholic as I am, I liked these better!  They're like tiny little delicious shortbread cookies (which I'm normally not even a huge fan of) and they just really hit the spot!  Will definitely have these on a regular basis in our pantry! TL;DR I agree with the first reviewer"
"This is my second review request for this mustard.  Again, I will say that it is my favorite mustard and hard to find in select stores.  I was so happy to see that I could purchase it on Amazon.  This is sure a great place to shop from my mustard to my hard to find shampoos.  This mustard is wonderful on all kind of meats.  My husband is not a mustard lover like me, but he does like this brand and selection. TL;DR best mustard ever"
"Hubby grew up on this product and recently wanted retry it. I find it kind of ironic that it's indeed finding a resurgence lately.....Sunday newspaper coupons as well as TV commmercials for it. Since he's Diabetic, I buy the ""no sugar added"" Vanilla flavor [his favorite]. I tried a sip, and neither of us can detect an aftertaste, however we are both ""no sugar added"" junkies. Neither of us are ingredient experts so we don't know what gives it a sweet taste. But we do know it provides him with 21 essential vitamins and nutrients which he definitely needs for his very active job. I mix up a couple bottles @ a time [12oz bottles recycled from salad dressings], put in the fridge and he just grabs one in the morning on his way out the door to work. He can quickly dring a bottle on the run while working, and get some sustanence when he really needs it. The Subscribe/Save makes the price like $1.00 a box cheaper, no shipping costs, and we always have it on hand in the pantry. Love Amazon! TL;DR Keeps Hubby Happy/Healthy!"
"I purchase these unsalted, dry roasted peanuts from this company on a regular basis for use in making candies. I've had absolutely no problems with the product or the shipments. TL;DR Ongoing Purchase"
"I got this a few months ago with high hopes but it was barely OK, kind of grainy, did not dissolve in milk. TL;DR Just OK"
"Well, what can you say about dog food in a product review? My dog loved it... 'nuff said. It has a nice ""meaty"" look to it and, were I a k9, I believe I would enjoy the food as well :) TL;DR My dog loved it..."
"My wife had seen this at Walgreens but a week later they'd apparently dropped the product line.  After searching at all the usual suspects we were unable to locate it anywhere.  Then we found it here and grabbed a couple of boxes to try out on a birthday cake.  It really does taste great and my wife and young daughter both loved it.  It was quick and easy to make, and just as easy to frost a sugar free birthday cake. TL;DR Great for Diabetics Who Love Chocolate"
"Could not find them at Sam's at Christmas time to make my peanut clusters, so was very happy to be able to get them off of Amazon!  Thanks! TL;DR Planters Redskin Spanish Peanuts"
I love these! Very hard to find in stores! So it's convenient to order online but they were a bit pricey. All in all a good buy. I received them in a matter of days and they were very fresh! TL;DR Delicious but pricey
"Buyer beware. The coffee blend for Obsidian appears to have changed (along with the k-cup packaging).  If you are a first time Obsidian buyer it may not matter to you that the Coffee blend has changed but for me, a faithful Obsidian  coffee drinker, it is a huge disappointment and deal changer.  Until recently, Obsidian k-cups were only available at a certain large chain. Now that they have expanded availability, they seem to have changed the blend/ quality of the coffee.  While the roast remains the same, the bean appears to have changed. No thanks TL;DR Not what it used to be"
Wonderful quality for this excellent eccentric culinary pearl. Reconstitutes very well and has wonderful flavor. This is a mushroom that has medicinal properties due to its pronounced levels of beta-glucans and alpha-glucans which are long chain sugars called polysaccharides known to stimulate the immune system in significant ways. Some caution is due with regular and or excessive use of anything that stimulates the immune system. Love of all. PEACE TL;DR Dehydrated Agaricus subrufescens/himematsutake mushrooms.
"Every time we'd stop somewhere to buy a soft drink, my Mother-in-Law talked about NuGrape being her favorite soft drink when she was a kid and how much she'd love one.<br />When I saw these I ordered them.<br />She was so happy you'd think they were Vintage wine!<br />I tried one and they are really good.<br />One got broken in transit but, fortunately, it never leaked through the carton and 11 arrived safely.<br />Make an older person Happy and buy her/him a carton of these. TL;DR Make an older person Happy!"
"The Balance Bar Gold Lemon Meringue Crunch bar is a good energy bar. At 28 percent sugar, 14 grams for a 50 gram bar, it is in the lower range of sugar content for energy bars. It is not too sweet.<br /><br />The bar has a nice lemon flavor. To me, it tastes a lot like lemon meringue pie. I suggest that key lime would also make a nice flavor for this kind of bar. As the product description says, ""No pie we've ever tried came with the satisfying crunch and nutritional punch delivered by this energy bar."" That may be somewhat of an exaggeration, but the bar does taste good and does have a balanced set of natural ingredients.<br /><br />One observation is that each bar weighs in at 200 calories. This makes it good for vigorous exercise, but perhaps too much to take a whole bar for a snack. On the other hand, we have been having snow storms every few days this year. I think that shoveling qualifies as vigorous exercise, so I can eat as many of these bars as I want to without worrying about calories. TL;DR Miniature Lemon Meringue Pie"
"IT WAS FREE WITH A GREAT MEMORY FOAM MATTRESS TOPPER SO, WHY COMPLAIN?<br /><br />NOT THE BEST FOR MY HEAD, HOWEVER, I NEED TO ELEVATE ME FEET WHEN LYING DOWN SO IT'S A COMFORT FOR THAT. TL;DR Great for Elevating feet."
"I use these in the office for my 4-cup coffee maker.  Previously, I had ordered the 4 pack of canisters of filter packs, but that product is no longer offered on subscribe and save.  I was a little concerned when I first ordered this product because of the lack of photo, but it turned out fine.  Each filter pack is individually wrapped in separate packaging (like you would find in a hotel) and the 100 of them arrived in a large cardboard box. TL;DR Perfect for small coffee maker at work"
"I was very happy to see a natural dry cat food at Walmart.  I've fed my three cats (ages 11, 6, and 5) this food for months and they all like it.  No diarrhea, no barfing, no problems.  I checked the FDA recall list and it is NOT on it.  The closest search match on the FDA site is NUTRO Natural, not the same product... TL;DR My 3 cats all eat it!"
These bars are awesome.  I eat one before I work out and they give me lots of energy. I am also on Weight Watchers and they are only 3 points. Not bad for a great snack. TL;DR Best fig bars ever
"I've had been using Pamela's Fluor since 4 years. My family loved the wafles, pancakes and cookies made with this fluor.Give it a try it, and sure you will love it. TL;DR Pamelas fluor you can do anything with it!"
"I received this in the mail a few days after i bought it, but all of the cans were broken, so i couldnt drink any vernors, DO NOT BUY SODA FROM THIS GUY. TL;DR Cans were broken"
"These are not like the original Jacks Links beef sticks, this are tangy, spicy and long  :-).  At first I was upset like the other customer thinking they were going to be like the original ones but after eating more than 5 I started getting used to them with their spicyness.  They are good and now I miss them :-(.  Putting myself on the waiting list. TL;DR Spicey, tasty goodness"
"I never liked Cherry's unless they were fresh picked, but this does it for me.<br />I love the dark chocolate and liquor combination.<br />Beats them all in this product line TL;DR Wonderful for Cherry Lovers"
"I've been faithfully using Dove conditioner for, well, awhile, but I'm always interested in trying something new, so I had no problem with giving Clean Scalp & Hair Beauty a shot.<br /><br />O.M.G.<br /><br />This conditioner is seriously amazing. Firstly, it comes out nice and thick, which, to me, is always a sign of a quality conditioner. The conditioner smells amazing and I was really hoping that it would work as good as it smells.<br /><br />IT. DOES.<br /><br />It not only got my hair nice and almost completely tangle-free after my shower, it did the same for my 8 year old daughter, and anyone who has an 8 year old daughter with almost waist-length hair can definitely appreciate that!<br /><br />Sorry Dove - I think I'll be cheating on you! TL;DR Smells amazing and soft hair!"
"These are so good, and worth the money.  Everyone in your family will love this.  Good alternative to chips, or other snacky junk food. TL;DR Great take anywhere snack"
"Cinnamon is wonderful quality, flavor is sweeter and better than anything you buy in a store. I generally use a half teaspoon in my cup of coffee in the morning. Packaged in a resealable  aluminum-plastic package Delivered ahead of scheduled arrival. Very happy with purchase. TL;DR First class cinnamon"
"I love Larabars, and have about 1 a day during the week - so much so, that I have been ordering them in bulk to save a few bucks.  I very much like the spiciness of the Ginger Snap flavor, and is probably my 4th favorite flavor (after the brownie, bluberry muffin and pecan pie).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the latest bars I received were moldy, and they don't expire for months.  This item is not eligible for return, which is unfortunate.  $25 into the compost....what a waste! TL;DR Moldy!!!"
"I noticed that a few customers have had a bad experience with the freshness and delivery. I am not denying anyone's trust of their tastebuds. However, I would be remiss if I did not state that I have always received these fresh and delightful-tasting. They have never been delivered broken, as I have ordered 4 cases to-date. I actually prefer the flavor of these to O.N.E. brand. Although O.N.E. are quite tasty, VitaCoco are a little bit sweeter, on average. Lest we forget these are fresh from coconuts; none will taste the exact same. And the resealable 17+ oz. boxes boost its ""star power"" in my review. I drink them when I go to the gym. They rehydrate me much better than purified or spring water, and come in a resealable container, making them ergonomical for the gym, too. Sports drinks cannot even be compared, with their sticky, fructose-mouth feel. I always longed to find something that hydrates better than water alone and without the sticky, sugary taste in my mouth and heavy feeling in my stomach like sports drinks leave behind. VitaCoco does just that. It has 5 electrolytes, namely Potassium, which has been suggested to help prevent muscle cramping...pretty big benefit during physical exertion, would we say?!<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend VitaCoco coconut water. For me, these are just what the doctor ordered. TL;DR Delicious - Always Came Fresh"
"This is a pretty good quality and tasting organic walnuts.  Of course because it is organic it is like twice the price of other walnuts.  Still not sure if the organic nuts vs. non-organic nuts will really make a big difference or not to our health?  The only real dissapointment was that you get much more ""pieces"" than you get ""halves"".  This is the key thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars. TL;DR Pretty good quality and taste"
"Somehow a fruitcake called Trappist Abby sounded ""pure"" to me so<br />I didn't check ingredients - mia culpa. After attempting to<br />read them, I at least recognized ""high fructose corn syrup"" The<br />disappointing taste of this fruitcake led me to consider the contents so,<br />finding them less than pure, I pitched it. TL;DR Unreadable ingredients - PLUS - High Fructose Corn Syrup"
"I was really looking forward to this salt substitute but it falls far short in my opinion. Tastes like a glorified version of Mrs. Dash and far from salt flavor. If you want something really good try Himalayan Pink Salt sold through Amazon --- it's outstanding !!!! I purchased the one with the grinder and it could not be better. Yum , real salt but good for you. TL;DR It's just another form of Mrs. Dash"
"This is another one of our favorite Kernel Seasons flavor.  The BBQ and Nacho Cheddar are the other favorites.<br /><br />It's good to mix things up a bit and have different flavors on hand, because you certainly can get sick of eating the same flavor over and over, especially if you eat popcorn almost every night like we do!<br /><br />These six packs at Amazon are the best deals, but you may want to order a single pack of various flavors first to try them out.  Unfortunately, the Ranch and BBQ and several others are usually not sold at grocery stores (although you can get the Nacho and White Cheddar easily at most stores). TL;DR Another Great popcorn seasoning!"
Perfect blend of wonderful tea flavor and sweetness.... not too sweet to take away from the tea taste.... love it TL;DR delish
i use this instead of sugar as sweetener. Its super nutritious and once you get used to the taste its awesome. Has a strong raw taste. TL;DR strong taste and very nutritious
"The first order of Pig Ears were large (4x6"" average) and thick, but my second order of Pig Ears are half the size and thin.  Definitely, a lower quality. TL;DR Small pig ears"
2 cats have pancreatitis and one of which has a chicken allergy (we think) and this is the only brand of food other than the prescription only stuff that the furballs like and is ok for them TL;DR pancreatitis cats
"This is an excellent product and you might be tempted to use more than the recipe calls for.<br />However, you better do a LOT of cooking or have several friends to share it with.<br />16 ounces equals a LOT of bay leaves. TL;DR Excellent product for you and your friends"
"My dog absolutely loves these treats!  Right now I have him in obedience class and I use these to reward him when he does a good job at class! I also give them to him when we're at home at it's between meals.  I highly recommend these for all dog owners, your dog will love them! TL;DR Chicken & Venison Jerky Dog Treats"
"This is a very refreshing tea! Plain green tea tastes like cut grass to me! The lemongrass flavor makes it a whole different animal! It is one of my favorite green teas. I have not tried it as iced tea, but i think it would be wonderful. TL;DR Refreshing"
Make your own rice and use the Eden bean of your choice for a better dinner.  The canned beans are great. TL;DR Not their best.
"I love blueberries so I was really looking forward to trying these...wow, am I glad I did! The 4 lbs. of dried fruit is packaged in a sealed plastic bag that is tucked inside the cardboard box shown in the picture...once opened, the bag fits nicely inside a one gallon zip lock bag for storage. About the size of small raisins, these dark blue fragrant gems are sweet, chewy, and full of mouth watering blueberry flavor. So far I've mixed them into hot oatmeal and yogurt and, of course, eaten them straight from the bag. Fresh blueberries are still my favorite but these will definitely satisfy me when I can't go pick my own. The subscribe & save price is very fair and worth every penny. Yummmm! TL;DR Yummy, chewy blueberry goodness..."
I just cannot believe that Omaha Steaks has been irradiating their burgers since February 2000.<br />Here is their link of proof:<br />[...] TL;DR These burgers are irradiated
The packaging was intact and all but when I opened the box I found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn't break apart (even when I tried smashing them against the concrete). At some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together.  It is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart. Not exactly what I wanted. TL;DR poor quality
"We love Crystal Light drinks and we drink them all the time.  In the summer we drink a lot of iced tea but we also watch our caffeine intake.  This Crystal Light flavor is ideal for us as it is almost caffeine free and the light raspberry flavor just makes the drink better without overwhelming the taste of the tea.  This is one of our favorite flavors of Crystal Light and we think that you will like it also! It is best when served cold for the ideal taste.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />* Low Sodium.<br />* 99% caffeine free with only 10 mg of caffeine per serving.<br />* Non-carbonated and easier on your stomach.<br />* One packet makes 8 servings and there are 5 packets per container so you get 40 servings per container and this item features a pack of four.<br />* Only 5 calories per serving with 5 mg of sodium and less than 1 g of carbohydrates.<br />* Each serving provides 10% of your daily requirements of vitamin E, vitamin A and vitamin C.<br />* Less expensive than carbonated beverages. TL;DR A refreshing and light raspberry flavored tea!"
This product is amazing! If you need a pick u upper with all natural ingredients this product is for you! It will give you stamina and guard you from colds and flu simptoms! TL;DR Perfect food!
These are some of the best you can get for fans of non-flavored coffee.<br />Newmans and Caribou are some of the very best and the other two are also very good!<br />Enjoy! TL;DR some of the best!
"These are pretty good, my kids like them.  Are far as fruit snacks go, these are about as healthy as they get. TL;DR Tasty. Pretty healthy."
"My Grandchildren [and great grandchildren] love these Gumballs,We keep them in a container that my wife made that resembles an old time gas pump, miniature, of course.The kids really love them. Thanks for a good product. and a good transaction. TL;DR Kid Magnet"
These are the best cheerios on the market!!!!! All the stores in my area shrunk the Cheerios section so I am glad Amazon added this to the subscribe and save program.  Now our cheerios ship automatically.  Great buy!!!! TL;DR The Best!!!!!
"So this is the first green tea ive bought and the second ive tasted. The first one i tasted was alittle better tasting. This stash green tea however does taste lets say, 'natural'. what i mean by that is it taste exactly like what it is, all natural dried herbs. It does look like leafs though not just crushed up almost powdery stuff like the other bag i drank. Im not quite sure what green tea is supposed to taste like but this one is NOT good but its NOT that bad either and its also NOT sweet at all. But hey i am drinking green tea for its health benefits not for its flavor. Overall though i DO recommend this green tea just like the name says it does appear to be premium green tea judging by how it looks and the 'natural' taste, so if your just after those health benefits you wont be disappointed if you want good taste this probably wont make you happy. TL;DR ITS ALL NATURAL AND IT TASTE LIKE IT....VERY HEALTHY THOUGH.."
"We bought the package of Pop-Secret Microwave Kettle Corn ""100 Calorie Pop"" 10 ct. Snack Bags and it almost ruined my microwave. I have a very expensive Jenn Air microwave with a POPCORN sensor on it. The first bag I tried, after about 30 seconds the microwave started moaning and buzzing really loud. I went over to take a look, and it was like a light show going on inside. I quickly opened the door, and could feel the pressure from inside push the door open! I figured maybe it was just that particular bag, so I tried another. SAME THING HAPPENED. If my microwave breaks anytime in the near future I would bet that this popcorn incident is to blame. DO NOT BUY-SERIOUS SAFETY RISK. I am calling Diamond Foods to complain. It's a good thing my kids were not making this popcorn on their own! TL;DR DANGEROUS---Buyer Beware!"
"I love this salad dressing. It has a great flavor that is hard to describe. It is kind of a nutty/hearty flavor, with a nice subtle hint of nutritional yeast and tomatoes. Creamy texture, similar to tahini. Beautiful orangey color looks great on salads. It is also great for a dipping sauce for carrots and celery. It is vegan too, which means it is suitable for vegetarians as well. TL;DR My favorite dressing!"
"I have this like Almond Butter, Since I have to wait to get><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002OK2FCA"">SunButter Organic Sunflower Seed Spread, 16-Ounce Plastic Jars (Pack of 3)</a>> It DOES NOT have Added Salt or Sugar!

"This product is way too good. The nuts are fresh, the chocolate is delicious and I could not stop eating just a few. I have self control over other foods and treats, but not this one. I doubt I will buy it again. It is just way too good. TL;DR Way too good."
"I bought these for my 10 week old puppy to keep him busy for a little while during dinner or in the morning when I get ready.  I was previously using the N-Bone Puppy Teething rings but these are smaller and less expensive. My puppy can chew through one of the small ones in about 15 minutes but it is made to be eaten.  It keeps him busy for a few minutes, which is nice.  I would reccomend these to keep their attention for a short time.  A lot of other reviews mentioned that there was a strong smell, so I specifically checked this, they do have an odor but I had to hold it to my nose to smell it.  Overall it is a good product. TL;DR My dogs love them"
"Fue un regalo para mi hermana y le agrado mucho, llego en tiempo y forma todo OK.<br />muy recomendado, las flores estuvieron frescas y el jarron es muy lindo TL;DR Excelente regalo&iexcl;&iexcl;"
Makes a great Latte without the trouble of brewing expresso. great tasting not bitter. We love the monin products especially the sugar free flavor syrups. TL;DR expresso without having to make it
"Super easy to make and fat free!  The taste, however, is a bit bland and uninteresting.  I suppose it is too much to expect from something fat-free, though. TL;DR Good, but not great"
"I was excited for a good cup of hot cocoa, but this product just did not meet my expectations. I have used the three smallest size settings on my Kuerig and the cocoa is always too watery. Very dissapointed! TL;DR Too diluted"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H1567O"">Cardini Original Caesar Dressing, 20-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> This is my favorite dressing for any green salad and having a good supply is a must in my household. TL;DR Cardini dressing"
I purchsaed this salt as a replacement for Laury's seasoned salt with Tobasco. There was not much of a comparison because the Laury's salt was just heads above this product but unfortunately they discontinued making the Laury's Tobasco salt. Alas! TL;DR It's OK
"After Eights are delicious.  They are light and tasty and just what you want at the end of a nice meal.  I love that each mint is wrapped separately in an elegant little envelope.  Our dinner guests always enjoy eating them.  I do store my thin mints in the refridgerator, but they taste just as good at room temperature. TL;DR Delicious!"
"I had forgotten that I ordered these. I went to check the mail (in Alabama in July) and couldn't figure out for the life of me why I started smelling vanilla from 20 feet away from the mailbox. Obviously once I held the package in my hand I remembered. I used most of these beans to make my own vanilla extract (which was amazingly easy and SO worth it). I have also used them a little in baking and to make some vanilla bean ice cream. Every use I have found for these has been perfect. I think I have one still in the bag in the back of my cupboard but I'm unsure as to whether or not it's still good.<br />Making your own vanilla extract, buying some pretty bottles and some ribbons/labels is a great Christmas gift idea. TL;DR Amazingly fragrant and delicious"
"I first tried the double chocolate brownie cookies before they improved them, and they would've earned more like a 3 or 4 star rating.  I decided to give them another try after I noticed the new packaging proclaiming ""Now even tastier!""  They are beyond delicious.  You don't have to go looking for flavor - it's right there.  It's a great treat for anyone, let alone those of us cutting out or cutting back on gluten.  They're the right density, moistness, and chewiness, just like the perfect brownie.  It is true that you only get 12 in a box and they are kind of small.  I ration them so I only go through a box a week.  It's not the box to reach for if you're really hungry.  They make a great quick-fix, though. TL;DR Definitely Chocolate"
"The rub of course is for a comparably sized florist boquet you will spend close to $100 delivered.<br /> This company will have the flowers delivered for $35. So thats why I gave them 5*'s, the price. No the flowers arent hand delivered in a pretty vase, they come in a box and the person has to arrange them.<br /> But the flowers I gave were very fresh, the packaging was excellent and came with a cold pack to keep the flowers fresh.<br /> I have ordered with ProFlowers before and this company here on Amazon is 10x better. The ProFlowers werent sent next day for the base shipping fee, these flowers were. The box didnt include a cold pack to keep the flowers fresh, these did. The ProFlowers only lasted a few days, these flowers have lasted a week and still look good.<br /> Also these flowers were more abundant and had a lower price than ProFlower flowers.<br /> So this company is the new winner of this market. And this particular boquet was very nice to boot. TL;DR Pretty good flowers though not quite up to florist quality boquet"
"Heard of them through a family member. My order was shipped and received in less than a week after it was placed. Fast, efficient and will continue to use and recommend them to other people who miss our PR coffee! Thanks! TL;DR Excellent service!"
"I tried integrating this into my German Shepherd puppy's food.  He is currently on California Natural Lamb and Rice puppy formula, but I have a hard time finding it - so I thought I would switch to this Royal Canin.  He loved it.  But then he started getting diarrhea.  The diarrhea may have been from something he ate in the yard and not the Royal Canin.  Regardless, I donated the Royal Canin to a dog shelter.  This is after I read reviews on it, and discovered it has some bad reviews.  It has lots of fillers in it.  I prefer a more natural, healthier dog food (this is my opinion after what I've read).  There are good websites to compare pet foods and read professional reviews on them. TL;DR Has a lot of fillers"
I got these treats for my two cats who are not really that picky.  They seemed to like them and begged for more like usual.  They are pretty firm for a semimoist treat.  They almost look wax like but the cats chows them down with pleasure.  I have ordered them more than once from Amazon already. TL;DR My cats liked them.
"I drink a lot of cappucino, so I decided to try this drink. It is only vaguely reminiscent of real cappucino. That said, it was rather tasty, a nice light drink. If you don't care much about true coffee flavor - and they do name this a ""coffee drink"" - it might be worth a try. TL;DR Not cappucino, but not bad."
"I switched to this food in an effort to stop the daily vomiting with my six cats. They ate it for about a year with no problem. The vomiting decreased to almost nothing and most of the cats seemed healthy eating it, except one which started getting a bald spot on her back.<br /><br />Then, about a month ago, they stopped eating it. The same food sat for a week, so I dumped it and opened a new bag, thinking something had happened to that bag. Same results. I also realized that it had a smell I never noticed before, kind of musty or moldy, very unappetizing and it tainted some items I had in the pantry where the unopened bags were stored.<br /><br />I don't know if they changed the formula or if I got three contaminated bags, but I'm out $60+ because of it. TL;DR Cats stopped eating it"
"I was intrigued by the flavor combination of this; I had never thought to try aloe as an ingredient, and even if I had, I would have never paired it with passion fruit. So I went in curious. I was disappointed.<br /><br />The drink looks strange - olive green with translucent, slightly darker green bits floating in it (the thick opaque label hides this fact at first glance). But I was okay with that. One swig, though, and I felt like I was chewing my drink - the bits are slimy and numerous. The taste was pretty sweet at first, but I did not the tinge the aloe gave to it, and the aftertaste sticks with you.<br /><br />A few swigs later, I resigned that I wasn't even going to finish the bottle. It was tehn I noticed that the bottle isn't one serving - it's 1.4375 servings (an 11.5-ounce bottle with a serving size of 8 ounces). This strikes me as a ploy to make the nutritional info look better.<br /><br />All in all, I won't be drinking this again, unless it's free and I have no other option, and even then I would have to think about it. TL;DR Strange texture and taste turned me off"
Holy mother of chocolate!  I never knew you could make chocolate so dark.  It definitely will satisfy your craving if you are a dark chocolate fan.  It was a little much for me so I'm going back to the 72% version.  You've got to love Ghirardelli for giving us so many choices. TL;DR CHOCOLATE
"got two of these for my daughter she put it away for holloween lots of stuff well worth original price,i paid 5 bucks TL;DR spooky package"
"This is a great creamer, it is hard finding Irish Creamer in our hometown and my husband loves this stuff. The only problem I had was when the box arrived, one of the creamers was smushed open and the creamers weren't in a bag just the box so I had the wonderful task of washing each little creamer and finding the culprit in a soggy box. I highly recommend using this creamer, it has a true Irish Cream taste without the alcohol. The price is very good and is lower than what other bulk foods websites are offering for the same brand/type. TL;DR Great creamer for the price"
"I was a little disappointed... It was too mild for me.. I tried brewing stronger, but not my cup of tea. TL;DR not so great"
"I had to laugh at the product description. Those are the words to describe certain chocolates, not a water! Still, as a bit of a water taste snob, this is indeed great tasting water. We have well water that is absolutely vile to drink. I've found that there are great taste differences in bottled water, be it spring or filtered. I usually choose spring waters, but this product brings up the point that it can be produced anywhere, thus leaving a smaller carbon footprint.<br />PH levels in the body are a hot issue right now...the new 'mangosteen', if you will. There are products to raise the pH of your own water, which is normally in the 7 range. If you've been following the pH trend in health, this water is a terrific beverage option. TL;DR Silky smooth taste???"
"With lots of minerals, this salt it actually works well with the body and taste amazing. The plastic bag was strong and the salt was in perfect condition. For over 10 years, Himalayan salt is the only salt we use! This packaging and quality met my expectations and I will order again. TL;DR Yummy - best salt ever"
"I only purchased this for the HcG diet, I got the whole case of twelve boxes and used only two.  It did the job as in I used it to snack on, but it tasted like I was eating a crunchy cardboard box.  I guess I can feed the rest to the ducks. TL;DR Did the job"
"ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />Okay, what I received was not what I bought.  The shipper was not Cultures for Health, and despite the clear description of the product on the Amazon page, I received LIVE cultures, not the dehydrated grains that I thought I had purchased.  It feels very dishonest to me.  I bought this product because someone I trust recommended Cultures for Health dehydrated water kefir grains to me, as they had a good experience with them.  I am not pleased with this apparent duplicity!!<br /><br />I have brewed the water kefir anyway, and will see what results I get from the product.  So far, I have nothing to say (positive or negative) about the quality of grains (i.e., how well they brew, and whether they have longevity).  When that changes (positive or negative), I will weigh in again.<br /><br />REVISION:<br /><br />I have since brewed the water kefir, and it has produced a good product.  So, the grains are good. TL;DR what the heck?! - a revised review"
"Bought this for my husband for Valentine's day and he loved it.  Nice big cookies, with alot of flavor. Twelve cookies come in a package.  All are individually wrapped, so it stays nice and fresh. TL;DR YUMMY!"
"Company shipping the tea very fast.  Fair prices.  But the tea itself, just doesn't so it for me.  Very bland and I see no evidence of any health benefits, namely the weight loss effects.  If you want tea that tastes good...try something else. TL;DR Bland and no signs of health benefits"
"Got this for the grandkids. They would only drink the milk chocolate variety, which they said was delicious. I bought several boxes so am hoping someone else wll enjoy the other varieties. TL;DR Milk Chocolate is good"
"Light, crispy, whole-grains and mocha chips. Open one, have a quick sniff, and you're suddenly in the best coffee shop in town. 130 calories, equal parts sugar and fiber. Spectacular. TL;DR These are just plain GREAT."
"Contains no cactus needles.  Works great for peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on toasted rye. TL;DR Excellent, with a flavor all its own"
This is the absolute best gum flavor ever.  It really tastes like Key Lime Pie and the flavor lasts a long time. Yummy! TL;DR BEST. GUM. EVER.
We're hooked - We love the Artisan salts and use it in our grilling at every opportunity.  Yummy! TL;DR Love it!
"First of all, these are COOKIES people. You aren't supposed to eat them with no abandon. Like everything, moderation is key, and then it's fine to eat these. Obviously if you sit there and eat a whole package every day for a week, that isn't very healthy.<br /><br />Secondly, if you are expecting American style cookies, then you will be disappointed. These are not the same in the least. These are made with what they call Biscuits in Europe. They are *slightly* sweetened, almost cracker like in texture. The frosting is not made out of crisco and sugar like American cookies are, so it's not all oily and disgusting. But it also tastes VERY different. The cocoa is not super strong, but it's a nice compliment to the biscuit portion.<br /><br />If you're used to sickening sweet cookies, then you'll probably think these taste weird.<br /><br />Personally I love these because they are more subtle in flavor and not so sweet it makes my teeth hurt. They're really good with tea. TL;DR HIT Cookies are a Hit"
"According to the manufacture the xylitol used in this gum is produced in the USA from birch, not GMO corn from China. This gum has a pleasant taste it is not too strong or over powering. Xyloburst, like most xylitol gum does not have long lasting flavor, but it does last long enough and it does not get rock hard once the flavor is gone so you can chew it for a while. The gum does a great job of controlling  bad breath/ refreshing your breath after meals. The added oral hygiene benefits you get from the xylitol is also a plus. I have been chewing this gum for a while and I have nothing bad to report, TL;DR Great Gum"
This product is a plus.  The sole is delicious and easy to make.In less than 45 minutes you can serve an elegant meal.  I have ordered these several times and have never been disappointed.  My guests believe that I have spent considerable time in  preparation of this dish! TL;DR Stuffed Sole
"You cannot beat this product. Same for all the Tinkyaka rice pastas. You cannot tell the difference between these gluten free items and durum wheat pastas for texture, flavor (as a full blown celiac I really appreciate products that resemble, are as good as, what I used to eat before I was diagnosed). You can reheat without the decomposition that happens with quinoa pastas. Leftovers freeze well and reheat well in either oven or microwave. Recommend the brown rice Tinkyada products where available because the protein and fiber count is a just little higher. Amazon is less expensive than any grocery store and they deliver to your door free of charge! TL;DR If you are restricted to a gluten free diet by your doctor"
"I buy this for my mother, who loves this product. I have heard great things about this from my aunts and uncles too.<br />I usually buy in large quantities (15 sachets per box, and about 18 boxes)(or 9 bags of 30 sachets/bag - if the count is 30, then they come in a large plastic bag instead of a little box) for my mother from the veryasia website directly because it has a flat rate shipping of $4.99. They carry this at the local Asian grocery store too, and it is around the ballpark of $4-5 per box of 15. The 30 count one usually is around $8. The direct website's price (veryasia) is around that price too. However, it would cost me more than $4.99 to ship all that to my mother, so that's why I order it.  I have placed about 3 or 4 of my large orders already. I do an order every 5 months, and they all have arrived well. TL;DR Great Product"
"This is a convenient little energy drink additive (key word, it's a concentrate and it's meant to be added to something else). Simply hold it over your drink, give it a squeeze, and it will shoot a dose into your drink. As far as what to put it in? I wouldn't recommend water. Alone, this tastes like medicine. If you add it to crystal light or something, it's good. You'll taste it, you'll know it's there, but it isn't bad and it will turn your regular beverage into an energy drink. TL;DR Mix with something Flavorful"
There was a lack of information about this product shows a picture that contains a variety of candy. There was one candy I saw that I wanted the box set for. It was the BUG CITIES!!!! It shows that it has them but it does not. Do not be fooled. TL;DR Misleading
"Mix of tea, decaf, flavored and other coffee.  Not as advertised.  Should of paid attention to the reviews.  Not worth a return but would never order again. TL;DR Random assortment"
The product was very well packed and fresh.  I am very happy with the taste and it was also an extremely nice addition to my breads.  I will definitely look to buy more when this shipment is used. TL;DR Excellent taste and great value
I have two dogs - a one year old WestiePoo and a 12 year old Bichon - they fight over this toy.  It is very sturdy and they love the fact that there is rawhide to eat also.<br />It definately keeps them busy and occupied. TL;DR Both my dogs love this toy!
"These treats are great for training our miniature poodle.  Who is very self willed.  He never seems to tire of these treats. But with that being said we dont give him a lot.  Only one when he does something we are trying to get him to do.<br /><br />I heard one pet owner makes her own.  Havent figured out how to do that yet.  So this is what we are doing now.<br /><br />The price is cheaper than our local pet store.<br /><br />But in my opinion, this company is make a boat load of money, hand over fist.  Knowing the price of liver, cheap, cheap, cheap.  I wish I had a freeze dry machine.<br /><br />Great item for those that are not the do it yourself freeze drier. TL;DR Natural Competitive Price - Dog Loves It"
"This is a Wonderful substitute for flour when on a gluten-free diet.  The bag has various recipes for cookies, muffins, deep frying batter and banana bread, as well as pancakes and waffles. We use it to make gravy and sauces too. TL;DR Wonderful Flour Substitute"
"I don't normally drink strong coffee, so this variety was good for me. Good flavor, but not too strong or bitter. The only down side is that several k-cups (probably 6 or 7 out of the first 2/3 of the box) failed and left an excessive amount of grounds in the brewed coffee. If not for that, it would be 4 stars.<br /><br />At the price I paid ($27.75) it is a pretty good value as well. TL;DR Good coffee, good price"
"I was looking for a decaf coffee K-cup with good flavor and Timothy's has delivered.  I wouldn't classify it as extra-bold, nor particularly espresso flavored, but it's definitely got nice well rounded flavor. TL;DR Very nice decaf coffee!"
"The only reason I purchased this product was to have a natural sweetener as a substitute for sugar. The ingredients did NOT list sugar (on Amazon page), but when I received the shipment I saw that sugar was one of the ingredients. TL;DR It has sugar in it"
"When I was little, this was always the syrup that my Grandma had when we were at her house.  I hadn't had the Karo syrup in easily more than 20 years, so it brought back a lot of memories!  Wish it was still sold in stores around here...  very tasty! TL;DR Love this syrup"
When all the dried cocoa is used up in the K-Cup the cocoa is pretty good.  But two out of three times my brewer leaves 1/3 of dry mixture in the bottom of the K-Cup.  When this happens you get a cup of chocolate water.  Might as well say you have thrown away fifty cents.  Stick to the old fashioned cocoa packages and set your brewer to the hot water setting. TL;DR Waste of Money
"Again...who's doing the taste testing for these Argo Tea folks?  Folks coming back from a camping trip in the Sahara?<br /><br />Have to say it's better than their ""Mojitea"", but not by much.  The taste here is just overpowering as well.  It's...thick.  Too thick.  Tea should be refreshing.  I shouldn't have to brush my teeth afterwards.<br /><br />That said, I drank the whole bottle (after the initial, first sip, WTF is in my mouth reaction), which is more that can be said for the Mojitea, sitting in front of me about to find it's way to the trash can.<br /><br />Seriously.  Sun Tea.  Back Yard.  Go. TL;DR Better than their Mojitea"
I love that Honey Maid came out with convenient packaging. I am a huge graham cracker fan and now I can just grab them on the go. You get just enough in the package to fill your snacking urge without having too much or too little. I love how they stay fresh longer since you get 6 smaller packs within the box. This is a great snack for you on the go or for your children at school. I highly recommend these convenient fresh stacks if you like graham crackers. TL;DR Same great taste but new packaging
"I love this tea! I shared it with my family, and they love it too! The smell is wonderful. I add a bit of honey to sweeten it. TL;DR Great Tea!"
"These biscuits go very well with the PG Tips tea I ordered, and they even taste good on their own. Normally I'm not big on this kind of biscuits - they're either too sweet or too bland - but these have a mildly sweet taste that's surprisingly addictive.<br /><br />I'm not happy with the packaging though. In the pack of 7, only 3 turned out perfect, 2 were slightly crumbled, and half of the last 2 were badly smashed. TL;DR Very good"
"This product is the straw that broke the camel's back, making me 100% convinced I should not eat anything made in India.  Of course, it helps I have a long history of frequenting Indian groceries for staples such as frozen naan and papadam...and it doesn't help that I frequently find half-exploded cans of botulism-encrusted, expired, imported Indian goo in any random neighborhood Indian grocery.<br /><br />So here's my report on first opening the package:<br /><br />The jaggery looks like unreasonably yellow tofu cube looking sugar blocks; they are not the lovely and natural blond or brunette of colombian panela or mexican piconcillo.  The smell is horrible, something like the plastic on a bad capacitor that has burned out, the smell of a soldering iron, something strangely industrial and/or metallic and/or plastic and/or burning.  Brake dust.  Computer on fire.  Pthalates burning in a trash heap.  Scumdog millionaire sets the pool toy factory aflame next door to the sugar fields.<br /><br />...This is food???<br /><br />Ok, I thought, maybe it's the packaging that I'm smelling, so I drop them in some water to bring to a boil.<br /><br />First thing happens, yellow color starts emanating from the cubes.  ""Oh"", I think to myself, ""It's been hit with yellow #5, or at best, Turmeric"".<br /><br />Next I notice the jaggery starts to bubble.  Bubble?  My mexican piconcillo doesn't do that.  It's just sugar, right?<br /><br />Finally, as it dissolves, I waft the scent of brake dust, caramel, something strange like a fake beef or meat flavor, something strangely umami but muskier.<br /><br />Then I dump the whole thing and toss out the 2 lbs of jaggery I bought.<br /><br />No more Indian food.  The irony is that you have a perfect product that nature produces, then you have to adulterate it, overcomplicating it with garbage, making it unacceptable.<br /><br />Attention India and China: I will not participate in your industrial-waste-laundering-through-food scheme. TL;DR Poisonous tofu cubes made of sugar and brake dust"
"So I got this for my Belgian Malinois who is ball-crazy and always destroys both plushy toys and kongs alike. A friend of mine who has a large shepherd said her dog loved to toss it around the house, chew on the treat on the inside, repeat. He absolutely loved it. In hopes mine would love it the same, I got it. BOTH treats were out of the ball in about five minutes(not exaggerating!) but lucky me my dog loved the bounce the ball had and continued to play with it. I put some rolled cooked bacon mixed with raw beef in the very center of it, and he is hard at work right now trying to pry it out of the center. Overall it was a good buy, but not because of the ""challenge"". Only because my dog loves the ball itself. I wouldn't purchase the treat inserts again, thats for sure! TL;DR My dog is just way too smart..."
"I bought it as a change for the Nescafe Tasters choice (which is instant coffee), but we didnt like it at all...we gave it away.  A much better choice is the Godiva Hazelnut ground coffee... TL;DR Didnt like it at all..."
"I must disagree with the reviewer who said the fifth avenue was a Clark bar wannabe.  In my opinion the Fifth Avenue far out excels the Clark bar.  This is my 2nd order.  The candy bars are extremely fresh and too yummy,  I ate them all !  I will continue to buy candy from Amazon. TL;DR Far out excels Clark Bar !"
"Olive oil has great taste and value.  I didn't want to spend all day looking for the perfect olive oil; this one had good reviews and a good price per liter as compared to grocery store varieties.  I use olive oil for everything (as opposed to any other types of oil), so Zoe's is a good compromise on quality and value for a large amount - good bang for the buck.<br /><br />My biggest (really only) complaint are the annoying tin cans.  Every pour from the can results in wasted oil coming down the side of the can or resting on the top of the can.  I feel like any money I saved buying this oil is being poured down the side of the can.  Plus, I get to clean it up, every single time.  That annoyance alone is not worth any saved money.<br /><br />Bottom line: I do like the taste; I do enjoy cooking with it; I hate the cans.  I would consider buying this oil again in a different container type if the price was still right. TL;DR Love the Olive Oil; Hate the Cans"
"I expected these cookies to taste like animal crackers, but they are so much better.  Real chocolate flavor and very crunchy.  Best of all, low in calories and all natural.  Love them! TL;DR Yummy Little Bunnies!"
"I have been making wine, and purchasing wine kits for many years.  This kit was literally half the price of what I have been used to paying.  Plus it also included corks and labels which the other kits do not.  The wine was excellent.  I highly recommend this item! TL;DR Montepulciano wine kit"
I was looking for a very similar size and shape cookie made by Archway in a red bag when I found these. These are very close but a little drier then the Archway cookies- still like them very much. TL;DR Very good cookie!
A disappointment....i threw it away.  i thought the egg would be high quality and comparable to Cadbury quality.  Did not think egg was high quality milk chocolate and egg was way way overpriced.  Next Easter will buy Cadbury milk chocolate. TL;DR i know Cadbury eggs...these are no Cadbury eggs
"I really liked this product. For me, there's not much need to have a dry powder regularly on-hand, but it does make good shakes, so I'm glad that I tried it. TL;DR Delicious!"
"Yes, the first ingredient is meat, but do not be fooled. The following ingredients include multiple soy ingredients to make up most all the protein content. All the soy and corn ingredients are conventional which means they are cheap, GMO, ingredients. The unimpressive ingredient list also includes multiple artifical colors...these are for the owner's benefit. If you want a healthy dog that lives a long time, find a better, natural dog food that doesn't rely heavily (if at all) on grains(Amazon offers a multitude of options). Dogs aren't designed to eat such high amounts of grains. When factoring cost remember that dogs won't need to eat as much if it is quality food, and ultimately you'll spend less on vet bills. TL;DR Your dog will eat it but it doesn't mean they should!!"
"I have ordered the Maple Almond Butter multiple times, and two times, I received a bad batch.  The first time (jars), Amazon (excellent customer service) refunded my money.  The second time (squeeze packs) I decided to contact Justin's directly via Facebook.  Justin's told me that a batch of plain almond butter had been packaged as maple almond butter and that I should send ""Todd"" an email and they would replace it.  I sent the email, but never got a response.  When you get a good batch, it is wonderful, but for this amount of money, I'd expect the quality control to be a lot better.  I think they may be growing too quickly and they can't maintain the quality with the faster pace of sales.  It's very disappointing because I like the product when I get a good, properly labeled batch. TL;DR Bad batch"
"One reviewer stated that these don't work with full size adult roaches, however I've captured three using these traps. I was also surprised to discover that these work great to control small fruit flies, coffin flies, and gnats. The key is to always place them along the wall or in corners. Theyre good to place behind furniture and especially near electrical outlets, as these are the most common paths that insects take when navigating through your home. If you catch nothing at all, move the traps to other areas around the house and try again. They're cheap enough that you should buy more than you think you'll need and then place a couple in each room. Keep in mind that the more you place strategically around the more likely you'll trap insect that treads close enough to catch the scent and investigate. Good luck! TL;DR Traps full size American cockroaches, nymphs, spiders and flies"
"I love Zipfizz. I get quick energy, but not like the shakey caffeine energy. I feel better able to focus, and it definitely helps my running and strength training workouts. Best thing is that there is no crash. I take Zipfizz everyday and I think the vitamins help prevent me from getting sick as well. Win Win! TL;DR Quick energy, no crash"
"This tiny little plug of rabbit goodness is adored by both our cats and our dogs, making it a very useful treat! Both the dog with hare paws and our Manx cat jump to get hold of them - poing indeed! TL;DR *Poing*"
Our family always looks forward to enjoying the special holidays blends from Green Mountain coffee.  The pumpkin spice is especially our favorite. TL;DR Pumpkin Spice cups.
"Make sure you don't pass these up the next time you're in the market for cat treats.  They disappear very quickly around here!  They do provide some nutrition so they are getting more than just something on which to chew for awhile, but the flavor is pretty unique and they always know when I bring them home from the grocery.  It's pretty funny to see our cats dash for the bag!  Highly recommend! TL;DR Great flavor!"
"I received this as a gift for my birthday, and as impressive as it looks, the products inside are pretty bad tasting. All the chocolates tasted stale, and were of bad quality.  The additional candy is very cheap and not impressive.  I felt bad throwing it out. TL;DR Very Stale"
"Our dentist recommended Xylitol suckers or gum for our daughter who gets cavities really easily. We opted for the suckers and we are very happy with them. They could probably be a little more flavorfull, but we love the fact that they are sugar free and feel good about giving them to our children. TL;DR Great Suckers"
"package arrived  I guess it was delayed because of all christmas deliveries, but the coffee is great!  I would highly recommend this product! TL;DR good bold coffee"
"This is a good coffee for people who don't like their brew all that strong.  A friend who likes the lighter roasts loved this brand, and went ahead and bought his own 3-pack.<br /><br />Personally, I need more flavor and body in my morning cuppa coffee.<br /><br />This grind did work well in DSY ""pods"" such as Keurig. TL;DR Nice for a medium roast"
Good long lasting flavorful gum at a great price.Hard to find in my neck of the woods(Long Island).Won't kill ur teeth too! TL;DR great gum
"I was first introduced to the Peanut Butter & Co. products by a coworker who races for their cycling team.  He gave me a jar of the Maple flavored PB which was AMAZING!  I got the packets of Bee's Knees PB for weekends and other times when we never seem to have anything to eat.  This past week I took them on travel with me and not only is the PB really delicious, but it's super convenient and it fits great in a purse.  We got to the airport late and didn't have a chance to get anything to eat, so I just ate the PB right out of the pouch.  It is super yummy and doesn't separate at all in the pouch.  A great snack and a great company.  I will definitely be getting more! TL;DR Awsome"
"If someone where to ask me what this product tasted like, I'd call it a sweet ""Spreadable Graham Cracker"". It is sugary with a faint taste of cinnamon. It is based on Speculaas cookies that are popular in the Netherlands and Belgium. This kind of thing is new to me. You can also get this at the Wafels and Dinges truck in NYC, if you want to try it out. TL;DR Spreadable Graham Cracker"
I LOVE my candy!! I used to each these as a child and then I found them when I was on a cruise. I looked and looked and looked and could never find them.....until I checked on Amazon!!!!!!!!! Thanks so much (I cant stop eating them!) TL;DR All Smiles
"Break them up and add them to your cereal.  Or break them up and add a bit of milk or dried blueberries, nuke them in the microwave and enjoy ""hot"" cereal.<br /><br />I break them into little pieces, add some milk, and sometimes some fruit and microwave for two minutes.  For festive occasions add a tiny ort of butter!<br /><br />As others have mentioned, you can add toppings.  Just chewing one of these is an exercise.  But it's not a bad one.<br /><br />Getting older is sometimes about making prudent decisions about what to put in your body.  You won't find these at a gourmet restaurant, but they are excellent in your arsenal of low-carb, low-fat, fibery, filling foods. TL;DR Good Health Option"
"I have been eating this stuff for a decade and a half, ever since I worked in a teriyaki restaurant slinging yakisoba and udon soup bowls at the tender age of 18.  There are lots of good reviews on this product already and I agree with all of them... this stuff is HOT but also TASTY.  I ALWAYS have a bottle of this on hand.  My latest favorite thing to do with this sauce is to mix it with an equal part of Frank's Red Hot and a splash of vinegar and use it to drown a plateful of pelmehni (Russian dumplings).  That mixture, by the way, is also fantastic on wings.  On it's own, Rooster sauce is a MUST for me in ANY curry... it adds heat and complements the flavor perfectly and I also love to drizzle a bit (just a bit) into my chicken soup (not weird....I used to dump truckloads of Rooster into my Udon noodle soup!).  Really, the uses for the Rooster are endless.... but if you regularly cook things like stir fry or curry (any style) and you like a bit of kick.. this is a MUST HAVE pantry staple.  Plus, it's fun to dare people to eat spoonfuls of it.  :)<br /><br />I'm hungry. TL;DR Gotta go with the Rooster!"
"She's a picky eater when it comes to snacks and I wanted something natural, without chemicals and these are great. The ingredients are simple and there's no chemical soup.<br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is the shipping cost! The product itself is 5 star ++++. TL;DR My dog loves these!"
I agree with the previous reviewer. This product is not of the quality I expected. It's one of those ordinary bottled products that fails to satisfy people who are looking for the real stuff. TL;DR Not the quality I expected
I ordered 12 bottles.  I received 11 and two of the lids were broken.  To top it all off water was starting to leak through the bottom of the box.  Not happy. TL;DR POOR PACKAGING - DO NOT ORDER FROM AMAZON
"I was skeptical about how to get rid of tartar on my 4 year old golden retriever.  First he loves the treat and after giving it to him for 4 weeks, probably every other day or so, I have noticed significant reduction in the tartar build up he had. TL;DR Really works to reduce tartar"
"Simply put, this is the best coffee that's ever been brewed in my house. I'm buying 10 pound to give as Christmas presents. TL;DR Unsurpassed"
"I first found this tea at a favorite store (Smokehouse of the Catskills, Veteran, NY) that sells a lot of interesting foods imported from Germany as well as their own smoked and fresh meats.  I'd enjoyed this brand's mint tea for years, so despite some irritation at their giving up the lovely brand name ""Pompadour"" for the far less pleasant (to me) ""Teekanne"", I decided to try their other flavors.  The fennel is lovely; I like it at least as much as mint, and it has a positive effect on an unsettled stomach.  People who dislike licorice or anise flavors would be unlikely to enjoy it, but I really appreciate both the aroma and the taste, and am happy to find it on Amazon. TL;DR Different, delicious herbal tea"
I love Market Spice tea. The decaf is just as good as the regular.  Great service handling my order.  Will definitely order again. TL;DR more tea time!
Simple elegance. Subtlety and wonderful bouquet.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea to others who are looking for something delicious and classy.<br /><br />Give it a try! TL;DR Tasty and delicious
"My old dog is close to ten years old and like many big dogs, he suffers from back-end arthritis.  I give him the glucosamine each evening in his food.  His teeth are somewhat worn down, so water plus the Liquid Health softens his dry dog food so it can be eaten quickly.  He did not turn up his nose from the very first time, so it has no medicine taste apparently.<br />He gets up from a resting position, not as fast as he might have years ago, but he does not whimper or show signs of pain.  It is a good product and works for my Beau.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00178TEW4"">K-9 Glucosamine MSM - Improve the condition of animals suffering from joint ailments,32 oz,(Health Herbs)</a> TL;DR Old Dog Does Better"
I bought this at Big Lots between .7 and 1 depending on the shape of the pasta and it was ok for the price.  It tastes diferent than regulat wheat pasta.. but tasted fine eith the sauce and in a salad. TL;DR good for the price
POP! POP! POP! LOVE IT! WHAT MORE CAN I SAY? ENJOY IT WHILE WATCHING A MOVIE ... AND HAVE A NICE DAY! TL;DR Jolly Time Kettle Mania
"The convenience of having my cat food brought to my house, and saving money (competitively priced with local store) and time is great anytime you can do it.  Selection is good, and the multi packs are great too.  So far I'm happy with this.  I'm not sure my delivery person likes getting my orders.  &lt;grin> TL;DR Cats love it, I love the price..."
"makes a delicious cup of coffee. dark, fresh,and the price is resonable.Would definitely order again.A hot cup of this cofee helps motive me in the morning. TL;DR Good coffee"
"When my vet said to switch my cats from dry to wet food (for health reasons, potentially teeth reasons) I researched healthy cat food and really decided Science Diet was the way to go.  I tried all kinds of flavors, but my cats love this one.  It has never disappointed in the year I've been using it.  Much easier to order off Amazon, as the pet stores can run out of it. TL;DR Kittehs love it, consistent quality"
The chocolate was given as a Christmas gift and when it was recieved was covered in a white chaulky film.  I tried contacting the company without ANY responce.  HORRIBLE product and CRAPPY customer service!! TL;DR OLD CHOCOLATE
"We have a border collie/husky. She is 13 years old and we love her dearly. She has such a sweet disposition. I keep the Zuke's treats in a basket in the utility room. Whenever I go to that room, Sasha follows me and starts doing some of her tricks on her own hoping she will get one of her treats she loves. Judy Watson TL;DR zukes"
"I have 3 little yorkies. I decided to get them these ""bones"" so that they have something to play and chew on.<br />All 3 of them really loves these and cannot stop eating on it, I actually need to take it away or they will not stop!<br />All though I thought the size is too big (even the small ones) it really is a great product!! TL;DR Great Product!!"
"Spicy World Citric Acid came very well packaged (Oct 2012) and is of very good quality.  We used this to make homemade dish washer detergent (many easy recipes online!) As well as a very inexpensive version of ""lemonade powder"" without the unnecessary additives.  Kudos for a good product in solid packaging! TL;DR excellent packaging, excellent quality for making homemade dishwasher detergent and lemonade"
We have several of these machines at work and I've tried lots of different flavors and blends...this is one of the few I can keep down without my body convulsing with an involuntary shudder.  Lots of these instant coffees are very bitter or far too strong.  This one is actually very tasty. TL;DR Best in show for K-cup French Roast
"I really love licorice and enjoy a number of different types. This stuff is inedible. I might see if my chickens will eat it; but I'm afraid it would make them sick. I hate to leave a bad review, but I just wasted good money on this product and wish I'd known how bad it was. TL;DR RJ's Natural? licorice"
"sweet, rich and creamy taste and in my opinion surpasses the starbucks equivalent.  The 8.45 oz serving is plenty it gave me a good jolt. TL;DR sweet and rich flavor"
"If I was just judging these as gluten-free chocolate chip cookies I'd give them no more than 3 stars, but going against other mixes they are easy to make (even by children), and are relatively inexpensive, making them a 4 star product as long as people aren't comparing them to homemade.  They are slightly gritty from the rice flour and they don't hold together exceptionally well, plus they fall apart the next day.  But they do well when eaten partially frozen and actually make a decent cookie for a GF ice cream sandwich.  For slightly less spreading use Spectrum shortening instead of butter. TL;DR Pretty Good For a Mix"
"The beans are good quality and the coffee is tasty.  The flavoring is a little light and often leaves you guessing as to which flavor you are supposed to be drinking.  The quality of the coffee makes up for it somewhat but if you are paying for flavor and want flavor you should get it.  Not an amateur coffee drinker  I order 20 lbs. per month and frequent several area cafes. TL;DR great cup of java, good beans but could use just a tad more flavoring"
I must eat gluten & sugar cane & dairy free.  These bars allow me to avoid my allergies and they taste delicious.  I eat at least one every day. TL;DR delicious bars
"A few years ago, my mom and sister went to china, and the best thing they were able to bring back was a tin of chinese dragon pearl jasmine tea; or just plain ""Jasmine tea"" as it was called there. I loved it right away, and bribed my sister $20 for the last bit of tea before it ran out. after a long, fustrating search, I found this tea here on amazon, and decided to give it a try. I'm really glad I did, because this tea is an almost EXACT duplicate of what they brought back, except this time the tea came in fancy silky packets, and the writing on the tin was in english, not mandarin.it's got the same delicate aroma, and is the perfect cup of tea after dinner, or just to relax and unwind. If you've never tried this type of tea, you should, even my non tea drinking friends LOVE this tea, and always ask for it when they come over. TL;DR BEWARE, this tea is addicting"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F70R9C"">Good Earth Original Tea Blend, Tea Bags, 18-Count, Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  This is the best, strongest cinnamon tea that I have found - and - it is good and healthy, too!  Very very enjoyable! TL;DR Take tea and see!"
"Great product and really fast delivery.  I use this ofetn in many dishes for that extra kick.  Some find it a little hot, but I think it is great for queso, and other Mexican style dishes. TL;DR Can you say Queso?"
"This new Raisin Bran with Cinnamon and Almonds is the right step in differentiating the class Raisin Bran, but the cinnamon is far too subtle and the almond slices too few to make a significant impact.  Bolder flavors and textures are needed.<br /><br />It's not as good as Raisin Bran Crunch, and definitely not as good as Honey Bunches of Oats: Raisin Medley. TL;DR Better than regular raisin bran..."
"This coffee is roughly double the price of what you get at the Nespresso site.  Plus you'll probably get it fresher there.  As for the product itself?  It is great tasting and convenient. TL;DR It is about the PRICE, not the product."
I have used these for a little over a year now and they have held up very well. Great bags and great price. They do hold a lot and I love how you can roll them up fairly small. TL;DR Great bags
"If you are attempting to get someone to eat a little less meat with out them knowing, I would not make this mix my first attempt.  I can tell straight away that Fantastic Foods Vegetarian Sloppy Joe Mix is made from soy.  It has that distinct taste and texture, similar to meatless burgers, which I don't like.  Attempting to hide that taste with BBQ sauce and cheese has not helped.  The Taco and Chili mixes are far easier to cover up that taste and feel.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing this product again.  If you want to give it a try, purchase a box locally, because if I had a pack of 12, 11 of them would be in the trash. TL;DR Really Like Taco and Chili Mix by this Company; Don't care for the Sloppy Joe mix"
"My only gripe is it did not come vacuum sealed or with a safety seal.<br />Not that I think any one can mess with popcorn, BUT, the lid is large, so I put the jar on its side (I tilted it while opening) and popcorn came spilling out all over the floor.<br />Almost every kernel pops. Overall, a very good product, but only as exciting as, well, popcorn can get. TL;DR Very Good popcorn"
"I had researched my purchase before deciding to order from this vendor.  I ordered 20 stalks of ""Lucky Bamboo"" and plant food on Sunday evening.  When I checked my email on Monday morning, I had a message giving me the shipping status of my order as well as a very well written series of suggestions on how to plant and care for the plants.  The information matched every source I had previously read.<br /><br />The plants arrived on time.  They were packaged very well.  The plants are amazing.  They have great color, healthy leaves and very abundant roots.  Smelling of the stalks at the roots, there is a very earthy ""green"" smell, that I'd read is one of the best indicators of health.  The stalks are firm, and are all as long or longer than the inches promised in the ad.<br /><br />I WILL buy any other ""Lucky Bamboo"" from Kun in the future. TL;DR Perfect Customer Service.  Great Product."
"Great seller. The product was as described.  The seller shipped the product quickly.  Good, fair price. Honey Stingers are by far the best training/race day nutrition you can buy.  They taste great, easy on the stomach, and organic.  I love them. TL;DR Good stuff"
I purchased this to use as a moisturizer and it definitely does the job! My skin feels super soft and the coconut oil just melts into it. TL;DR amazing!
"This granola is fantastic, as are ALL of Udi's granolas.  Not only are they gluten free, but they have an awesome simple ingredient list. They are sweetened simply with honey, which I really appreciate. I hate it when there are multiple sugars or things like brown rice syrup in my food. I try to eat as simply as possible.  This granola fits the bill. I love it on ice cream, yogurt, or just by itself.  I am so happy that Amazon.com offers it in bulk too because the price is great and I am CRUISING through it.  Glad to have a lot of it in the house!  I highly recommend this to anyone searching for a delicious, simple, and gluten free granola. TL;DR Awesome GF granola!"
Perfectly packaged. I take these to the gym to have as an after-workout pick me up. Protein and fat and just a little sugar. Marvelous. TL;DR yum-o
as i do not eat dog treat all i can say is my dog seemed to enjoy them very much TL;DR for the dog
Actual treats are 3 times larger than the picture on the box.  My King Charles Spaniel cannot even chew them they are so big.  They are roughly the size of a double stuff oreo and hard as a rock. TL;DR Treats too Big for Small Dogs.
"At 190 calories, these bars provide a great calorie boost with very healthy ingredients.  Cranberries and almonds have loads of healthy benefits and naturally combining them into a convenient bar is definitely a one of a KIND product.  I am very satisfied with the taste and they are my friends' favorite choice when grabbing a snack to go from the pantry.  They have a short ingredient list compared to similar bars.  Purchasing through subscribe and save makes the amazon price the lowest I could find and very reasonable per bar. TL;DR Cranberry & Almond - Tasty, natural and nutritional"
"If I could suggest one change to make to these potato chips, there would be none. They are perfect just as they are. The chips have a bit thicker cut, a more complex potato flavor than regular chips, and just the right amount of salt--it's there, but it's not overpowering.<br /><br />These are the first Terra chips I have had. I was initially craving the Terra Sweet Potato Sea Salt chips and wanting to try those, but due to the larger portions they cost a bit more than I wanted to spend for a first purchase. Instead, I went with Terra Blue Potato Chips based on their reviews, and I am so thankful I did. I have a new favorite potato chip. TL;DR Wonderful potato chips - Perfectly salted, thick and crunchy"
"Used Dynasty Hot Chili Oil in a Shrimp recipe.  It completed the taste necessary making the meal outstanding. I was not familiar with this brand, but was totally satisfied, and would not hesitate using any other product from Dynasty. TL;DR Shrimp Delight"
This seasoning is great with ground Turkey (or beef)...it is a little spicy--in a good way!  The seasoning really makes great Albondigas and fantastic tacos.  Lots of sour cream is a must! TL;DR Spicy and loaded with Sabor
This product I would recommend to anyone who likes peas; it is different and delicious; the taste is great and if you can't get your children to eat peas they will definitely enjoy these.It also great to use in salads instead of croutons because they are healthier for everyone. TL;DR Healthy Snack
"I really enjoy having the K-Cup Carousel to not only clean up my counter tops, but to display the many varieties of great K-Cup coffee we have.  Out of the box the K-Cup Carousel was ready to use.  It spins freely and holds 35 K-Cups.  This is a must have for those of us whom fancy ourselves as domestic barista's. TL;DR Less clutter"
"It is hard to please everyone in my family, but everyone loved the Shepherd's Pie I made, using this product. My picky son asked me to make this often, so here I am looking to buy more! TL;DR Family loved it!"
When I was a kid these used to be sold by schools as fundraisers and were not available any other way.  Let me tell you when I found these I was estatic!!  The candies arrived fresh and just as delicious as I remember from my childhood.  These take me back and now my kids also love them!! TL;DR Childhood Candy Favorite
This is the only stevia I use because it tastes sweet with no aftertaste and it dissolves easily into cold liquids and beverages.  I use it daily. TL;DR The best Stevia
"If you have a woman in your life GET HER THIS!!!! My girl didn't believe me when I told her how amazing this stuff is...until she tasted it, I honestly think she loves me more based soley on the fact I got her this chocolate lol it's powerful stuff man INVEST! TL;DR Great Gift"
I love ginger! But I don't like the gross ginger teas you can get at Asian import store - they're a bit too gingery somehow and just taste bad. This is a perfect blend of both ginger and green. I haven't been able to find anything else like it. It's the best tea you'll find in a bag! TL;DR Delicious!
"Like many other Vine reviewers I was sent a package of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JGQ15Y"">Oreo Peanut Butter Fudge Cr&egrave;me, 11.3-Ounce (Pack of 3)</a> cookies to try out.  Let's start off with the fact that these are not traditional Oreos.  We found them to be quite tasty, but they aren't traditional Oreos with two cookies and creme in the center.  So what are they ?<br /><br />While we were trying out this new Nabisco offering, I had a sneaking suspicion that I'd had this cookie before. A cookie with peanut butter...  covered in chocolate...  Ya know, if I didn't know any better, I would swear this was a Girl Scout Tagalong.  True, the Scouts don't use a chocolate cookie for their base, but the end result was very similar. They were even packaged the way the Girl Scouts sell them in individual slotted trays.<br /><br />Now that's not to say the Peanut Butter Oreo Cremes weren't tasty.  In fact, they disappeared rather quickly around our place.  Everyone seemed to enjoy them.  I just couldn't help but feel that they should have been delivered by the local Girl Scout troop. TL;DR Deja Cookie ?"
These cookies are delicious and healthy.  I will be buying these to share with my family. Quaker couldn't have made a better cookie! TL;DR Yummy
"This is not the most healthy choice in terms of ingredients, but I do notice that it has lower Saturated fat and sodium than the South Beach bars so that's also a plus!  Same great taste and everything, as well! TL;DR Healthier"
I bought these for my little West Highland because they looked so good.  When I opened them I thought I would eat them because they smelled great.<br /><br />These jerky strips made my dog  VERY VERY SICK.  I am taking him to the vet AGAIN today.  He is a tough little dog.  It takes a lot to cause him problems.<br /><br />I started giving them to him about 3 months ago and he has not been well since.  I haven't given them to him for 2 1/2 months.  It took me a couple weeks to track the source to his sickness.<br /><br />I posted this on my local craigslist and I received several replies regarding people who had dogs that have been very ill after eating these.<br /><br />You should have the strips evaluated at a lab like I'm doing.  It speaks for itself.  Don't take my word for it - but your dog might wish you did!<br /><br />If I can help people protect their dogs I will do it.  Obviously if someone is buying these for their dogs it's because they want them to have the best!  If you want that for your dog - please pass these up!<br /><br />I gave this product one star because I couldn't give it zero.  I guess the one star would be for the great aroma and texture of these toxic treats. TL;DR Please beware
"This is the best beef jerky I've ever had! The quality of the beef shows, and the kick from the habenero is enough to let you know it's there, but not too much to be overwhelming. Tender, not too salty, and full of flavor - give this one a try! TL;DR Great buy!"
"Regretfully, these pods don't work in my brand new Ariete Cafe Prestige espresso machine.  All I get is colored water.  Yuk!!<br /><br />I know the pods are the problem because the machine makes wonderful espresso using the coffee beans I roast at home.  I had hoped to use the Lavazza pods to avoid the mess of using loose coffee grounds.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I made the mistake of buying 150 of them from Amazon and now I can't return them.  I tried using them to make American coffee but the results were just as bad.  I also tried cutting the pods open and using the ground coffee inside to make espresso.  That didn't work either.<br /><br />What a dissappointment. TL;DR Makes colored water in my new Ariete Espresso Machine"
"The product description for this bottled water makes various health claims: in addition to hydrating better than regular water, Essentia is supposed to boost the immune system, help maintain restful sleep and heart health, and so on. There are two justifications for these benefits: the increases electrolytes and the pH of 9.5.<br /><br />These health claims are the sort of thing that really need to be evaluated by scientific trials, not by individual experiences. But a bit of quick googling about ""alkaline water health benefits"" shows that the scientific literature is pretty thin. There seems to have been one study saying that alkaline water increases bone density, which is a good thing for people worrying about osteoporosis, and another study saying that it improved hydration. Meanwhile, various anecdotal sources say that it can reduce acid reflux, which seems particularly plausible just from a priori reasoning: if you're having problems with acid, you might be able to neutralize it by adding a base.<br /><br />I don't personally suffer from acid reflux, so I can't assess its effectiveness there, but if it's a problem that you do have, then it might be worth giving this water a try since you'll be able to see very quickly whether it works for you. The potential benefits against osteoporosis, on the other hand, are longer-term, so without seeing further scientific studies I wouldn't personally want to embark on a program of drinking expensive bottled water indefinitely, since it would be harder to judge whether it was actually working. The interest for me, then, was mainly in the improved hydration.<br /><br />I'm a casual runner, and I hate to carry water with me, so it's not uncommon for me to end up with a slight dehydration headache even after consuming water when I get home. That happened once this week already, when I went for a 5-mile run just after noon.<br /><br />I drank my 1.5 L sample of Essentia over two days (along with other fluids, of course). On the first day, I didn't run at all, but walked about four miles. On the second day, I went for two short runs, 1.8 miles each way to the bookstore and back in the middle of the afternoon. It was sunny out, so I felt pretty sweaty by the end of it. I drank Essentia before and after the run, though there wasn't much left by the end, and so I also drank about 750 mL of regular water as well.<br /><br />I didn't end up with a dehydration headache, and I also slept well that night, but there are too many other variables at play for me to attribute these good things purely to the Essentia. Maybe the difference from my previous run was the much shorter length, or the time of day, or just the overall quantity of water that I consumed afterwards, regardless of whether it was Essentia. While I'm intrigued with Essentia's claims, I'm not entirely convinced. I'd be willing to try drinking Essentia over a longer period of time if it were provided to me for free, but for the moment, the benefits aren't clear enough to me that I'm willing to purchase it in quantity for myself at more than $2/bottle. I'll await further studies.<br /><br />The one thing I can comment on with confidence is the taste, which seemed pretty average to me. There is something slightly different about it, but I find it hard to describe: it almost seemed reminiscent of carbonated water, except it's not carbonated at all. Anyway, the taste was fine, but I didn't find it unusually good; it was pretty clearly purified tap water (like Dasani), rather than spring water. The taste was better than Dasani, but not something that I'd pay extra for; I'm generally happy enough with the taste of tap water.<br /><br />So with an average taste and health benefits that could use some more research, this isn't something that I'm going to buy any time soon. Still, people with different health needs (particularly acid reflux) may find it helpful to them, and it will be interesting to see whether further research turns up any more relevant evidence. TL;DR Well, it doesn't work miracles"
"I figured you could rip off the typical Anime freak/nerd/whatever but this is just dumb. These sodas cost a buck in Japan. ONE BUCK. And you'll selling it for FOUR!? This stuff is delicious, melon is my favourite, and these sodas aren't as sweet and full of unnecessary ingredients as American sodas are. Just five ingredients: carbonated water, sugar, High Fructose Corn Syrup, citric acid, and the artificial flavour of the product you're buying. That's it! Cute little 6.6 fl oz to boost (or you can buy the larger ones for like three bucks) and the marble is a cool effect, just a little confusing on how to open the bottle at first, especially if you're craving soda. This stuff is worth buying.........but not here. This is a total rip-off. Unless you're adamant about Amazong and willing to stay at home and pay for shipping and handling, and the greedy price for cheap soda, have at it. It's your money. Your call. I'm not the government telling you how you should spend your money. ........I just highly recommend you go somewhere else for your Ramune. Like Japan. Or a Japanese store. Not here. TL;DR Whoa! HOW MUCH!?"
"To me, when I hear 'mojito' I think mint and lime. This Crystal Light flavor is kind of like a very light, refreshing Limeade, but I can't really pick out the mint flavor.  So I think it is a stretch to think this would satisfy a craving for a Mojito, BUT it is still a really good refreshing drink.  It was a big hit with everyone in my family, including my 4 and 8 yr olds.  My kids called it lemonade, which it is closer to than a mojito.  I added a little fresh mint leaves from my garden, and it was very good.<br /><br />Summary, is it a 'mock' mojito? Not really. But it is still very good, and makes a nice summer drink. TL;DR Great taste, but it isn't very 'minty'."
"I really enjoy this and can enjoy it because the calories are so low. I like to sprinkle it on yogurt...apple, banana, plain...it's really yummy. My daughter puts it into her protein shake in the morning and has said dipping banana pieced or celery is also good. We've finished the jar and are starting on the 16oz pack. I hope this is a product that will stay around! TL;DR Sprinkle it on Yogurt"
"""Erythritol"" has become one of our favorite sugar substitutes since I became diabetic a few years ago. My wife uses a little bit of added sugar to bring the sweetness up for the rest of the family in things that need it, but I am happy with it as a one-to-one replacement for sugar in most things.<br /><br />I have not noticed any glycemic impact to my blood sugar or ""laxative"" effects seen with other sugar alcohol sweeteners (which is a very important consideration :-)<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />CFH TL;DR Great Diabetic Friendly Sweetener - Highly Recommended!"
If you like a soft cookie this one may be for you.  The Chocolate and Almond flavor comes through in just the right amount.  Each cookie is sealed in it own pouch so when you open it up it is fresh.  They come 6 packs to the box.  If you need fiber in your diet you can get 4 g per cookie.  You also get 180 calories per cookie.  While the label on the box states that the cookies are made with Whole Grain Quaker Oats (and they are) they are also made with wheat.  If you read down the ingredients they also contain soy bean oil.  While this is not important to most people it is to any allergic or sensitive to either ingredients. These would be great to keep in the car for a quick snack or to put in a lunch box for children to take to school. TL;DR Tastes Good
This stuff certainly smells strange but my dog loves it and its a great addition to his raw diet.  I mix it with fish or organ meats and feed it once a week. TL;DR Dog loves it!
"I just had to test out the Ghost Peppers after hearing all about these things. They're not that spicy and do pack a punch, but I am used to eating very spicy foods. These peppers will mainly be used for topping off my pizza and other foods. I ground most of it up, and the peppers will be used to spice up dishes. These are a lot hotter than Thai chillies, however I love the flavor from the ghost chillies. I saved a few in the original package since since it came in a Ziploc type package. Thanks for the fast shipping and I'll be buying more! TL;DR Good tasting peppers"
Bought this tea after reading about the benfits of controling weight.  I drink alot of coffee and also wanted to find something that I can subsitute.  This tea taste great and all have said no aftertaste as some teas do.  Have been recommending it to others. It's very light and just use a little splenda...I feel milk would make it too weak. TL;DR Oolong Tea is wonderful
"It holds the beans.  It's sturdy.  It's well constructed.  It's also undersized, and it crushes the beans. TL;DR Good not Great"
"Fever Tree is a good product. It has a little spicier flavor than Q tonic water. My personal preference(and these things are very subjective)is Q. TL;DR Honestly, Q tonic water is better"
"Good tea, in my opinion not the best, but good. I look at this tea as an everyday tea that is pleasant to drink. The first thing that I did learn is how strong it is. Steeping about 90 seconds is about as strong as I like, not like Tetley or Lipton teas. Overall a good product, but unfortunately I will not be buying these again, there are plenty of other great teas out there. TL;DR Good tea."
"These granola bars are quite delicious. Out of the three bars that Kashi makes, these are my second favorite (next to the Trail Mix ones). These make a good snack. TL;DR Very tasty"
"Is it just me or does there seem to be a LOT of sauce in their spaghetti these days?! In fact, the whole can is practically tomato flavored water and at around $1.40 per can, not a very good deal at all! If you want to give your kids a GOOD spaghetti lunch, buy some tupperware and send them to school with that! In a similar sized container you could pack in about 5 times as much actual spaghetti!  In fact, I dare everyone out there to do this little test at home:  Open up a can of Chef Boyardee Spaghetti with meatballs, dump it in a collander to drain off the sauce into a bowl. Then look at what is left over. Put this on a plate and then ask yourself if THAT looks like $1.40 worth of pasta!! Nuff said! I won't even go into the taste of this garbage. Give me a break! TL;DR Rip-Off"
"Thank you this great product.There is no staining or odor with this brand. I have 2 one year old labs and they like to chew.  These rawhide are great, keeps them busy for hours and they leave our stuff furniture, shoes etc. alone! Will order again.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />sdchubs TL;DR Great product"
"I bought four packages of these mint Oreos to dip in chocolate and they were a huge hit.  The mint flavor is a special treat I can only find around Christmas.  It has a nice, thick green mint filling (I didn't buy double stuffed, it's just the regular size cookie) sandwiched inside the Oreo cookie we all know and love.  Together, they are the perfect partners.  Great on their own, but amazing with chocolate. TL;DR Yummy."
"It helps with the digestion process. It also makes me sweat more while working out. The taste is good compared to other teas. I've been using this product for over a year now and combined with other factors I noticed an improvement of my health. If you are looking to lose weight, you can lose some pounds the first months. TL;DR Great product!"
"In southwest Ohio there is a Mecca for foodies. Jungle Jim's is located in Fairfield, Ohio. The last time I was there they had the Marabou Swedish Milk Chocolate bars, the large ones. I fancy the dark chocolate one. I too discovered this magnificent chocolate while in Sweden about 20 years ago. I got two words for this product, mmmm, mmmm! :) TL;DR Marabou Swedish Chocolate"
"I loved the idea of this, however, I couldn't get past the test. Everything about the drink tasted artificial as hard candy. I didn't find this drink enjoyable at all, and certainly not worth serving to guests as a non-alcholic option. TL;DR Not to my taste"
My 2 year old adores these crackers.  I recently was very ill and could not get to the store to buy them for her so I purchased them from a My Favorite Things through amazon.  Since the price was $8 and because the picture looks like a big box of crackers I assumed I was in fact buying a big box of crackers.  Wrong!  They were selling a little bag for $8 + $5 shipping.  When I contacted the seller to complain they were unwilling to do anything for me.  Thankfully Amazon stepped in but really I think they should ban this seller from their site.  Talk about price gouging! TL;DR Buyers beware.  This item is a tiny small bag of crackers not the big box you would think it is.
"I like organic. We do organic milk and meat (and vegetables when we can afford them).  My children like macaroni and cheese - not my homemade casserole that I sweat and work over--of course lol).  But only Mac that comes out of a box. [My hubby likes my casserole btw]<br /><br />In any case, you would think organic *Back to Nature Macaroni & Cheese* that comes out of the box would be popular at our house but it's not. Simple put, my children won't eat it.  We have tried three different kinds --white cheddar, regular, and special shapes--all with the same results.<br /><br />Perhaps it is because of the *lack of chemicals* that the cheese sauce comes out a little grainy. Or maybe I just made it wrong, but my testy tikes won't gobble this down like non-organic, over-processed wheat Kraft Mac.<br /><br />Two Stars. Maybe I just had a couple of bad boxes. Or maybe I just didn't make it right that day, but my two (boy and girl) would not eat this macaroni and cheese product. If you are going to try it (products do get IMPROVED every day) then my advice would be to buy ONE box and try it; and not a case. TL;DR Try a Box Before Buying a Case - a review of BTN's Mac & Cheese"
"We love this bread mix.  We use a little extra dark molasses than the recipe calls for, and that, combined with the flavor of the Guinness, gives you a rich, tasty loaf that works well<br />with sweet butter, or as an appetizer with smoked salmon and a<br />dab of horseradish cream.  Sometimes I add golden raisins to the bread before baking.  You can't go wrong here, this is<br />delicious and easy to make. TL;DR A delicious bit of Ireland in your own home"
"When I was first diagnosed with Celiac Disease (Gluten Intolerance), I was surprised at how many cereals contained food additives or other items that I couldn't eat.  Even if I ignored the cereals that were made directly from wheat / barley / oats / rye (the 4 things I cannot eat), there were still many other cereals based on soy, rice or corn (maize) that had barley malt in as a flavoring, so I couldn't eat them.  I tried many cereals until I found this one and I have had this as my mainstay ever since. It is tasty, has an excellent texture and I am sure anyone would like it. You wouldn't need to be on a special diet to enjoy this as a breakfast dish. TL;DR Excellent option for people with Celiac Disease"
"this stuff is intense. its both very salty and very sweet. it has a very peanuty taste, the texture is a very creamy/liquidy. its good. but very strong, think salted caramel intense. 1 tbsp and you're good. TL;DR intense"
"My wife and I drink a tremendous amount of tea. I just went through our pantry a couple of hours ago and found no less that 23 different varieties stashed here and there. These varieties include quite a number of different brands. Not of the different blends we drink, the on constant is that fact that we continually return to Earl Grey; it could sort of the considered the corner stone of our tea drinking. Yes, we like variety, but for general everyday use, we are never without Earl Grey.<br /><br />Now of the various brands of this blend we use both Higgins' & Burke (That which is being reviewed here) and for years have also used Twinings. Which one we use depends greatly upon which is available at the local store at a given time and which one happens to be on sale during that time. To say that we are ""frugal"" would be a kindness. I can tell you that in our opinion and according to our taste, that either brand is quite satisfactory. Now I know that each individual's taste differs greatly so I can only comment on our personal likes and dislikes. That is one of the reasons I am quite happy with the fact that we now have a wonderfully large variety of not only blends, but also brands to choose from...it has not always so.<br /><br />This tea has a rather rich earthy taste and if you drink it straight some may detect just a hint of bitterness. Since we both use sugar in our tea (my wife also uses cream), that is not a problem with us. To be frank, most of the Earl Grey tea we have encountered, no matter the brand, has that hint of bitterness...that is the nature of this particular blend. We are perfectly satisfied with this Higgins' and Burke and will continue to use it.<br /><br />If I may though, I would like to offer a couple of suggestions. Use pure water. Water found in many city water systems simply is not adequate due to the various junk they add to it. If you find yourself with no other water source, then it is best to use purified bottle water. The second suggestion is to let it steep long enough. The directions for this particular tea suggest 3 to 5 minute timing. I personally have found that closer to 6 minutes is required to bring out the full flavor of almost all tea bag tea.<br /><br />Anyway, this is an excellent product. We have used it in the past and will most certainly use it in the future.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks TL;DR EARL GREY...OUR OLD STAND-BY"
"I received this tea for a Christmas present. Dilmah is packed in Ceylon, therefore can carry the seal (see it above the name) of authentic Ceylon tea. I had never tried it before. Delighted to find it a clear, orangish color, smooth, with a pleasant 'wine' aroma, as well as smooth, light taste. No tannic aftertaste. The tin it comes in makes me equally happy, with a hinged lid and insert to help keep out air and light. Very lovely gift for yourself or someone special. Enjoy! TL;DR Delightful!"
"Pros: When Gevalia says Dark Chocolate, they mean it<br />Cons: Since when did 6oz become a cup?<br /><br />I have always preferred South American coffee to other regions.  A lot of commercial brands have been selling junk from the area but South America's better beans have a smooth taste with very little bitterness.  Gevalia appears to be using some of these better arabica beans from the area but honestly I wouldn't know one way or the other due to the deep, heavy chocolate flavor.  It reminds me of the days when I used to mix cocoa into my coffee cup, long before I became a coffee snob.  I would use this as a dessert coffee because the smooth chocolate flavor is quite nice; especially when cream is added to bring out the flavor.<br /><br />My only gripe is with the directions, ""1 rounded tablespoon for each six ounce cup of coffee??""  I guess you will need to do some calculating to equate to a real cup of coffee as you'll need more than 3 scoops to equal the size of that Starbucks Venti you've grown to love.  As for making a full pot, you should be fine using the same scooper you normally use. TL;DR Who are these gevalians and why are their cups so small?"
"Better than organic oats advertised elsewhere. Takes lots of water. These are not minute oats, so my oatmeal cookies come out right, not all crumbly and soggy. (Instant oats have their place, but not in cookies). TL;DR Good quality, delivered on time, human edible."
The best sugar to purchase.  Has a strong molasses taste. Sugar with actual vitamins.  Better for you than white sugar with no nutrients. TL;DR Sucanat
"Product was as described,will be using product from now on,but will purchase it at the grocery store,as they are selling it now,at a lesser price. TL;DR Sweet Leaf"
"Generally speaking I find that the changes companies make on classic snacks are really more about grabbing more shelf space for the company than really producing appealing product.  The family of Oreos is a good example, with the originals being the only really tasty family member.  And as a fan of Fig Newtons, I have to say I was skeptical about these new fruit thins, but what the heck, right?<br /><br />Well these things are really good.  Like original Newtons, part of their appeal is that they're not icky sweet.  If anything, these new fruit thins are even less sweet than Newtons, and the sweetener is sugar, not hfcs.  You may or may not care about that.  I think it's important.  What's also important is that a deal of the sweetness, as with Newtons, comes from the fruit.<br /><br />While the cookie itself is made with white flour, it does boast 2g of fiber from the addition of some rolled oats in addition to the dried fruit.  The result is a crisp cookie that has a nice, fruity flavor and no nasty aftertaste.  There are three large cookies to a serving at 140 calories.  That's not a bad snack, really, when you consider how little you get in most of those 100 calorie packs of cookies.<br /><br />This is perhaps not the most wholesome snack you can eat, but you could do far worse, nutritionally, and unless you like the uber sweet, artificial-tasting cookies that flood the supermarket shelves, you'll probably really enjoy the new Newton fruit thins. TL;DR Clear winner"
"Carrington Farms organic milled flax seeds are delicious with a slight nutty flavor kind of like wheat germ. But flax seeds are so much better for you and the texture is great! To get the full benefits of flax seeds, they must be ground or cut in some way or will pass straight through the body with all the nutrients still inside the seeds. They are a pain to grind yourself and measure exact amounts without a scale. These packets are fantastic because they are pre-measured, the flax seeds are already ground, they do not become dangerously rancid, and one a day on cereal or in a bowl of soup is a powerhouse of nutrients and positive health benefits. Centuries ago, Charlemagne made it law that people in his kingdom consume flaxseed because he believed in its health benefits so much! One of these packets has 2 grams of protein, 3 grams of soluble/insoluble fiber, zinc, B vitamins, 90mg of potassium (and only 4.8 mg of sodium!), sulfur, magnesium and on and on and on....<br /><br />The importance of balancing Omega 3 to Omega 6 appears to help so much with almost any type of inflammation from arthritis to intestinal inflammation. The proper balance also can help with depression. As well, some studies have indicated that consuming an adequate amount of milled flax seeds everyday can lower cholesterol as effectively as statin drugs without the side effects. Milled flax seeds seem to help diabetics because of the fiber and micro-nutrients, and also help people with a number of skin conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, and those who just want over-all better skin condition. It may even help those wih dry eye syndrome. It's good for weight loss too with all the micro-nutrients and beneficial oils which help burn fat.<br /><br />I believe Carrington Farms is packaging a little miracle in each packet! Stay with it once you begin with the milled flaxseed. Depending on how out of balance your Omega 3 to Omega 6 may be, balancing may take some time. I noticed almost IMMEDIATE improvement in my well being, arthritis pain, and blood sugar control. Not enough good could ever be written for such a wonderful product! This is a TEN STAR product as FIVE STARS are not enough! TL;DR GREAT taste! GREAT convenience! GREAT health benefits!"
"I bought this coffee for my husband and he just loves it.  It comes in a air sealed bag so its very fresh.  Its not to strong either<br /><br />Great coffee will definitely buy more when we finish this one TL;DR Great coffee, very fresh"
First had the tea in Mexico and instantly loved it.Tried to purchase in the states; but had no luck until I decided to check Amazon.Bingo!! Had success and have recieved my second order recently. Very happy with Amazon and my favorite tea. TL;DR For Black Tea Lovers
"my friend told me how she loves these YummyEarth lollipops, so I bought a bag to share at work.  everyone loves them like crazy and we're almost done with them in just a few days.  really packed with great flavor.  different than other candy.  very fruity and real tasting, not like overly sugary fake flavor of regular candy.  just awesome taste.  pretty cool, too, that it's organic. TL;DR the best lollipops I ever had"
I will not purchase cytomax again until the old formula is brought back. The new stuff tastes terrible! Please bring back the old formula. TL;DR Please bring back old formula....
The title pretty much says it all.  While the taste may not be as good as the offerings from you local espresso stand it isn't bad and doesn't seem to have the chemical aftertaste of some other sugar free drinks.  The powder dissolves pretty well although it will leave some noticeable residue if it isn't stirred a couple of times while you are drinking.  Throw a envelope or two in your briefcase and you won't have to drink the office coffee that was sitting on the  burner for the last 4 hours. TL;DR convenient guilt free indulgence
"Delicious, light and refreshing. 75 calories per 16.5oz can. Poured it on my cereal this morning and it was great!! We even make oatmeal with it. Delicious with pineapple juice and a little rum and/or cranberrry. Delicious on it's own as well. TL;DR YUM!!!"
"So I orignally thought uh, bad granola bars but I tried one because my parents are health nuts. OMG it doesn't even taste healthy which is a good thing! LOL! It has a lot of fiber which I have noticed a difference in myself, which is very good. Plus I save money rather than spending $.89 - $1.25 on snacks in the vending machines at work. IN 1 MONTH I'd spend $20 - $30, in two months on average $55.00. With the economy I'm looking to save as much as I can! If your a busy person like I am what your getting here it's abt $.58 a bar and your getting a 2 month supply. If your not sure go to your grocery store and get 1 box to try it out. PS ALL the Fiber Plus bars are good not just the antioxidants ones, try the strawberry almonds ones, yummo TL;DR Soooo good, good way to save money too..."
Caribou makes a mean cup of coffee. It basically tastes like you just paid $2 for it. Medium flavor and I mix my coffee with heavy whipping cream. Good stuff. TL;DR 2nd favorite all around coffee pod
In the past I have not had good experiences with Snackwell's products. I am talking to you Devil's Food cookies. But since I am a fan of carmel corn I decided to give this a shot. I am glad I did because it tastes very good. And the fudge is just the right amount of sweetness without going overboard. If you are dieting this is the perfect amount to satisfy your cravings. The real test is limiting yourself to just the one package a serving. TL;DR Tastes great and perfect if you can eat just one
"First found ""Sweet & Crunchy"" peanuts at a military commissary in Ft. Worth.  We loved them and have been looking in all our local stores for more.  We have not been able to find them anywhere.  I tried looking at Planter's website and ""YEAH"" there they were.  My family has really enjoyed these nuts as they are exactly what the title says---""sweet and crunchy"".  Delicious---makes a great afternoon snack. Shipping and delivery was very fast.  Thanks! TL;DR Love ""Sweet & Crunchy"" peanuts"
"i tried this tea at a bagel shop, i was curious at first because i real picky when it comes down to tea, when i sip the tea i was like oh my God this tea is so awsome!!! so i ask the girl to tear of the box so i can take it home and see if i can order it on amazon and to my surprise i found it!! i was so happy that i found it on amazon,i ordered it today and i cant wait to sip on my favorite hot cinnamon spice, i paid $1.48 for one tea bag when i can buy 20 teas for 5 dollars oh my God!! Thanks harney and sons for making the best tea and thank u amazon for carring the tea!!! TL;DR hot cinnamon spice tea"
"In this, my 4th year of home brewing, I have decided that crushing grains and watching thermometers was just to much. I drink 5 gallons of beer in about 2 weeks so the trouble of grain brewing was not worth the time.<br />I use this extract along with dextrose and hops to bend the beers flavor to my will.Very good base if you like a darker beer and the added hops can give you an IPA flavor without the multigrain,multihopped mess that I tried to cook from scratch. I do not use this extract as a stand alone beer malt but it is a neat short cut to a better brew than most kits. As I said, use it as a base and add other ingredients and your beer should turn out fine. My last batch using this extract is about to be repeated. TL;DR Pretty good base for your Beer"
"I originally had these breadsticks in a restaurant and could not find them in a supermarket or local gourmet shop.  I was thrilled to find them at Amazon and am delighted with receiving them.  They are delicious - light, crunchy and always fresh.  My family is enjoying them as well.  Don't hesitate to try them - you will certainly enjoy eating them. TL;DR Fantastic Breadsticks"
"I've been making some dietary changes in 2012 to try to improve my health and eating oats for breakfast is one of the easiest changes I've made. These steel cut oats are the best tasting I've found; they are easy to cook using the settings on my rice cooker and making a big batch to last a few days saves me some time and effort in the morning so no excuses to skip breakfast. I can make it very simple with some agave or sugar, or with a handful of homemade ""trail mix"" - dried tart cherries, chopped almonds, and coconut.<br /><br />I always check prices first but Amazon is usually well priced on this brand compared to my local stores.<br /><br />Very [leased with this product and highly recommended. TL;DR the best way to start the day"
"If everything in the U.S. were up to Bob's Red Mill standards, we'd be doing great.  Packaging, prompt delivery, quality -- all good, every time. TL;DR Like All Bob's Red Mill Products A++++++++++++++"
"Such a deal on my favorite coffee! The price was low, shipping fast and the coffee is great! The coffee was shipped in a sturdy box and arrived so quick. I love my Keurig and Emeril's Big Easy is so good and very tastey. TL;DR Best deal for the BEST coffee!"
"These sandwich cookies have a shortbread-like exterior and plenty of sweet-tart lemon filling.  They've been my favorite commercially baked cookie for years.<br /><br />Dare is a Canadian company and also makes chocolate, cocoanut, maple and perhaps other flavors of sandwich cookies, and they're all excellent. TL;DR If you like lemon, you'll love these cookies"
"Again, on time, priced right and as advertised. This is why<br />Amazon is one of my favorite sites. Good job. TL;DR On time, as advertised. The best surprise is NO surprise."
So PG Tips Special Blend was an excellent bagged tea. So excellent that the think tank at PG Tips / Unilever decided to discontinue it. They claim this blend is the replacement. The Strong One is a worthless brew if you ask me. PG Tips Special Blend was an excellent tea this replacement is terrible (undrinkable). If anyone at PG Tips is listening please consider reintroducing Special Blend - remember what happened to the new Coke? If it isn't broke don't fix it. TL;DR Weak replacement for PG Tips Special Blend
The rising prices of some coffees led me to experiment with new brand names of coffees with lower prices. I've found it with the Wolfgang Puck's blends of coffee. A great bold non-acidic flavor. Never worry about a lingering bad aftertaste. Excellent pricing. TL;DR Favorite coffee
This hot sauce is so different from vinegar based sauces. It really is a perfect blend of spices and heat. This is my new favorite hot sauce! TL;DR Great sauce!
It was so easy to grow and my cat loved it. I highly recommend this purchase. Your cat will love you forever! TL;DR Cat grass
"Different brands of red tea have slightly different flavor undertones. Many have a hint of something that reminds me of things like olives or cough syrup. This brand just has a vague vanilla undertone, which is exactly how red tea should taste. It's delicious, and I have a cup every morning and sometimes another cup later in the day. TL;DR Love this stuff!!!"
"I'll start off by saying that this gum has a very good flavor. The electric watermelon also mixes in with some sort of banana flavor making a perfect combo. Its a great addition to the 5 collection and would recommend this gum to anybody here who enjoys the 5 gum series. My only negative sight on this item would probably be the lasting time. Flavor only lasts about 10 min, or so then begins to fade.<br /><br />ALSO: Item has only 10 pack not 12, so I had to ask for a refund of $5.00. Be Careful! TL;DR 5 Prism Gum"
"This tea is better than any other mint tea on the market. It combines spearmint with peppermint for a unique taste. Plus, unlike many other brands, the bags come individually wrapped. Each sip leaves you feeling satisfied and refreshed. TL;DR The best tea ever"
"First of all, I am not really into all that really hot, spicy food. Some spiciness is alright, but bland food is fine with me. Here at the house we were watching some funny videos on youtube, people eating these, and after some talking about it, I bought this 15-pack, and I have to say, the people in the videos weren't trying to be funny; this stuff is unreal!<br /><br />If you just hold it by the stem and bite a piece off, you'd better have a butt-load of bread and dairy products on hand, because the experience is something you'd never expect. I chewed it on the left side of my mouth, and quickly felt like there was a blow-torch searing my tongue and inner cheek. It took my breath away for a moment, and I lost my voice. Then my throat started to burn, and I could feel the heat radiating from inside my body. I drank some 1% lowfat and then got the cold sweats. It definitely is a different experience.<br /><br />So if you want to make your prepared foods with an extra punch, or are just into some college-hazing type pranks, this is doubtless something to consider. It's amazing that something this volatile is even edible. TL;DR On those youtube videos, they aren't exaggerating!"
"I use potatoes a lot and by the time I have to cook and peel and slice them--I'm almost too tired to eat them. I also live by myself and if I buy the bags--they usually spoil before I can eat them all.<br /><br />I love these sliced canned potatoes, I use them in soups and fry them for breakfast and they are so good with ketchip on them.<br /><br />Libbys seems to be the best I have found, in quality and flavor.<br />Everything I have purchased from Libbys at Amazon.com has been really great. TL;DR What a time saver"
"Rich, aromatic and tasty. I love this product and will purchase more in the future. Everyone in this office loved it! TL;DR Delicious"
"I was very lucky to receive a gift package of Lake Champlain hot cocoa mixes. Very lucky. The three varieties included were: Traditional, Mocha, and Aztec. Three wonderfully chunky one pound cans of hot cocoa mix. Oh, boy! This is an all-natural product without additives or preservatives. The Lake Champlain company has been reverentially producing chocolate goodness from its factory in Vermont for over 25 years. They offer a variety of chocolate indulgences, including gift baskets and gift samplers. In addition to the addictive hot cocoas, they also tempt you with truffles, caramels, chocolate bars and other items of divine decadence. The hot cocoa mixes are rich and satisfying, made with milk and soothing to the soul and the senses. The flavors of the mixes are so full-bodied that I even added spoonfuls of the hot cocoa mix into the batter for brownies, cookies, cakes and etc. I also made my own gourmet mocha madness mixes by combining the hot cocoa dry mix with instant coffee granules and powdered creamer. I had my own private stash at work, and the scent of my cocoa-powered coffee creations had others asking what I was drinking. I was benevolent and shared some of the mix. I think I started something ; ) TL;DR Cocoa Mojo : )"
"A number of reviewers have complained about the matcha packaging. serendipiTea apparently listens to their customers, when I received mine the matcha came in a bag inside a green tin box which prevented any spilling. So don't let the negative packaging reviews stop you from buying this product.<br /><br />For first time matcha brewers, don't add too much matcha and don't use boiling water, unless you like your tea extra bitter. One level teaspoon per cup is more than enough.<br /><br />Delicious matcha for a low price, no more needs to be said. TL;DR Worth every penny"
"My dog loves these and everyone I have shared with agrees it's a great snack. Why feed grains and ""dog bones"" when you can offer a high protein healthy snack that promotes good health! TL;DR Healthy Snack."
"Well, some 10 years ago I began chewing Trident White, then switched over to this. I haven't been to the dentist in just as much time, until recently. Dentist gave me a clean bill of health, and was very surprised I had not had a clean up in over a decade.<br /><br />Has to be the gum. TL;DR It must be the gum..."
"I found this to be very weak. I like other Timothy's products, but won't buy this again. TL;DR Pretty weak"
"If I didn't have to add so much of this to my mug I would have given it 5 stars. It is wonderful; so much so that two different stores are often sold out. That tells you something.<br /> It is so irritating to race to the coffee aisle and .... nothing. So I got this for free shipping.<br /> If it isn't sweet enough for you, here's a suggestion: add a teaspoon of sugar to the cup . lol The chocolate or mocha tastes too much like hot chocolate mix. I have 3/4 of a can and my vanilla is almost empty. Add too much and you'll get candida and itch all night. It might be worth it !!<br />Thanks , Amazon!! TL;DR DELICIOUS WITH EXCESSIVE AMTS OF PRODUCT"
"This is the first Loma Linda or Worthington meat analog that was not thrilled with. I love most of their products and use them all the time, so I didn't hesitate to order a case of Swiss Stakes. For my taste, they are bland, blah and boring. As a stand-alone Swiss-style ""steak"", they just were pretty tasteless. The gravy is OK, but nothing to write home about. I'm using up the remaining cans by cutting the ""stakes"" up and putting them in Chinese dried noodle soups. I'm also thinking I can make them into burgers, as long as I load lots of ketchup and mustard on them. TL;DR Too bland for my taste"
I race homing pigeons and raw spanish peanuts are the best source of great protein and fat.  These peanuts are the best bulk quality I have ever seen! TL;DR Terrific Quality!!!!
"I bought a bottle of Blackberry Balsamic Vinegar last fall at a county fair, and since it is now running low, I attempted to find the brand that I had purchased at the fair, but to no avail.  When I found the Blackberry Ginger Balsamic Vinegar at Amazon, I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is as good as, if not better than, the old stuff.  I will definitely reorder! TL;DR It Doesn't Get Any Better!"
"I wrote a review just yesterday regarding Diamond's so-called Natural ""Lite"" Lamb and Rice Dog Food.  I was shocked to read that ""powdered cellulose"" was one of the top ingredients.  Well, guess what?  ""Powdered cellulose"" is in this ""natural"" cat product, as well.  Why would any caring cat owner feed his or her beloved pet powdered cellulose?  I guess Diamond has to use some kind of filler, in order to reduce the amount of ""real"" food.  Powdered cellulose is certainly cheaper than chicken; and, after all, it's all about the money.  Moreover, the 18 lb. bag arrived in a cardboard box that looked as if it had been dropped from an aircraft, AND the bag itself was split!  Approximately a pound of food was loose and leaking from the box.  Shame on Diamond for its awful ingredient and on Amazon for its crummy packaging and shipping.  I'm stuck with a split bag of awful food and the bill for it, as well.  Don't make the same mistake as I did. TL;DR Terrible Ingredient, Again--Don't Buy!"
"The taste could be better, but I have more energy and feel like it is a great way to start my day. TL;DR Very good."
"It doesn't taste as spicy as the jar that a friend recently brought back from England.  Regardless, the mustard Amazon shipped is good and at a good price.  However, when I'm done with these jars I'm going to get <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MSZK04"">Colman's Dry Mustard Powder 16 oz</a> instead.  It will keep longer and is a more general cooking ingredient. TL;DR could be spicier"
"This definitely is not as good as brewing a fresh pot of tea, but it is very convenient for on the go. I use it at work where we have a cold water cooler, and use two tea bags in a 20 oz cold cup. Works perfect, tastes good, and brews quick! TL;DR Awesome convenience product"
"The Probar fruition strawberry snack bar is very good.  I especially like the ingredients of dates(one of my favorites), oats, and strawberries, all mixed together to form a tasty, fruity concoction.  They remind me of Fig Newton cookies(another fave!).  It would be interesting to try any other flavors that Probar makes.  Being organic, and Vegan, the snack bar would appeal to a number of people who are looking for a healthy go-to snack.  I don't know much about the Chia seeds, but think that they are similar to flax, in their usage.  All the other ingredients seem to be natural, and not harmful.  I only gave the bars 4 stars because they are a little too chewy and gummy.  I would have preferred a slightly drier bar - I'm sure the culprit is the dates(which I do adore!).  They are a deliciously fine product when you crave a quick healthy snack! TL;DR a healthy go-to snack"
"I am sure this is a great product.  Madagascar vanilla beans and alcohol.  It's very easy to make your own for about the same money and you get a lifetime supply of pure vanilla extract.  All you need is madagascar vanilla beans (purchased on Amazon) and 80 proof vodka (liqour store), and amber colored jars (do an internet search it's very inexpensive). I made my own vanilla a few years ago, bottled it, labeled it and gave some as gifts, and I am left with a lifetime supply of the very best vanilla extract I've ever used.  Once the the folks that I gave it to as gifts, they have asked for the recipe and have made their own and thank me constantly for sharing the recipe and a saving them tons of money. TL;DR There's a better way"
This item does make fairly good baked goods but not worth the high price in my opinion.  Does not compare with regular baking four at all though. TL;DR Good but way overpriced!
"I tried chocolate and am normally not a vanilla person but since the taste and quality was exceptional, I figured I'd give it a try.  This drink is simply incredible.  They pack so much organic nutrition in 11 ounces and the taste is out of this world for a protein shake.  My only request is give us another flavor!!  My whole family is hooked. TL;DR Perfect Post Workout Shake!!  Delicious!  High Protein!"
"these are great and are definitely for those that love cheese. i personally love when cheese on pizza gets a little crispy around the edge. these are like a pack of just that. they are crunchy,salty and have great flavour.. they are a little oily but if ya set em on a paper towel for a bit it would absorb some of the oil.my kids love em too. TL;DR great little snack"
I love this tea and drink it most mornings. Ginger and lemon are good for digestion and thins mucus plus I get some antiocidants from the green tea.<br /><br />I have trouble finding this tea at the grocery stores and was delighted to find it online. TL;DR Great hard to find tea
"The Eden Cannellini beans have a nice texture and a simple flavor that blends well with other foods. I also find them more digestible than some other beans.<br /><br />Good mashed as well as whole, I have used them in place of tahini with garbanzo beans to make a nice, light hummos, mashed them and mixed them with seafood and herbs/spices to make a South-American (Brazilian?) style fritter (dried shrimp is traditional I gather, but anything you like can be good -- the beans hold everything together and are mild enough to let the other flavors shine through. Lightly dredging in flour gives you a crisper surface if you decide to try it...), and more. TL;DR A tender bean with many uses"
"I originally found this Roasted Garlic Juice at one of those roadside shops that sell a variety of foodstuffs, plants and ice cream. That was about a year ago and unfortunately, the place is now out of business. I was getting low on it and was glad to find it here on Amazon, as I couldn't find anything even close at any grocery store in a 50-mile radius. Store Managers were saying they never heard of pure garlic juice. I told them if they carried it, they would sell a lot.<br /><br />I have used this product for many dishes and marinades and the flavor can't be beat! It is pungent yet smooth and will bring out the flavor in any meat or dish you can imagine. I prefer the Roasted over the Cold Pressed, but both are great in their own way. It's nice to be able to pour or spray.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are a garlic lover, buy this!!!!! TL;DR Great Product! This is REAL Garlic Juice!"
"This item is not the filet or gourmet product I expected.<br />flavorful, yes. but the small can size and the bones and skin make the item overpriced.<br /> you would not have known this by the description given.disappointed, I cancelled future orders. TL;DR BONES & SKIN"
"I have never ordered this candy before but was unable to find bulk amounts locally.  I was a little nervous about the flavor as well as the claim that 2 day shipping was possible.  I was so pleased when the package arrived just as claimed, on the 2nd day after my order.  I was even more happy when I tasted the gummis and they were delicious and fresh!  I'm so excited, I'm ordering more right now!  We are using these at my daughter's wedding reception in 2 weeks and I know they will arrive in plenty of time! Thank you!! TL;DR Love it!"
These are my favorite. I would highly recommend them. It's kind of like Starbucks Mocha Latte... only without the milk. TL;DR Amazing
"This drink is healthy more for what it doesn't have than what it does. There are no preservatives, strange industrial-sounding chemicals, minerals, artificial flavors or colors, or high fructose corn syrup--which has been getting a knock from some nutritionists lately.<br /><br />ALthough listed above, here's another look at the ingredients:<br />Ingredients: 100% Juice (Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Apple, Grape, Acerola and Cherry Juice Concentrates). Natural Flavors, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C).<br /><br />I took a few sips without looking at the label. THe bouquet--if one may sue that term for a drink costing less than $1.00-- was nicely black cherry, but the taste seemed ""off.""  However, the brain is a wondrous thing: After reading the list of multiple fruit concentrates on the can, my taste expectations changed and I enjoyed the drink more.  There's nice carbonation bite in the aftertaste, and it's light and refreshing--perhaps due in part to the absence of corn syrup. I may have detected a slightly metallic taste but that may have been psychology too as I was holding a metal can.  Ideally, this would come in a bottle, but perhaps that would drive up the price.<br /><br />The nutritional quality seems, once again, more impressive for what you're not getting than for any particular benefit. It kept me ""hydrated"" with no fat, 130 calories, 15 mg of potassium, 35 mg of carbohydrates (33 mg of which are due to sugar (fruit may be good for you but it's apparently high in sugar content), 100% of Vitamin C due in part to adding Ascorbic Acid (VItamin C). There are no other measurable VItamins listed, no fiber (not a surprise) and no protein (not a surprise either).<br /><br />Price<br />Let's compare this to another quality (i.e., slightly more expensive cherry drink, Dr. Brown's Cherry Soda. A 24 pack of 12 ounce cans (288 total ounces) costs 24.99, compared to the Switch's regular price of $24 for 24 cans at 8.3 ounce per can (199.2 total ounces). That comes out to 8.67 cents per can for the Doc, and 12.04 cents per can for the Switch. Dr. Brown's has an incredible cherry flavor (and it does come in bottles, but at 15.75 cents per ounce) but you're getting high fructose corn syrup, caramel coloring, sodium benzoate as a preservative, and Red 40 for additional coloring.<br /><br />I think the price is reasonable given all of the so-called ""Vitamin Waters"" (here's a novel idea, take a vitamin with some water from the tap), and for those who practically NEED a little carbonation to feel refreshed, this is an excellent product. For pure cherry taste, however, I'd probably go with Boylan's or Dr. Brown's high quality, but more traditionally soda-like drinks.  Bottom line, Switch is worth trying, but if you're buying through Amazon, make sure you spend $25 or more so that you don't pay shipping! TL;DR 4 1/2*  Tasting and Other Notes for ""Switch"""
"I normally buy this product from my local grocery so there were no surprises.  Although Amazon offered much better pricing. TL;DR Good Earth Tea, Tea for Sleep"
I've tasted other brands of flax milk but this brand is the best by far...and it is creamy. Other brands are not really creamy and have a slight after taste...a little too nutty I guess. I can't wait to order this through Amazon...I hope the shipping is reasonable. TL;DR The best flax milk on the market
love to order my coffee on amazon.  easy and shows up quickly.<br />This k cup is great coffee.  dcaf is very good as well TL;DR caribou
"Excellent flavor, blend, and not excessive on the sugar. I would buy two again. Good packaging and communication. TL;DR Chai Tasty"
"I love these meal replacement bars. I warm one up in the microwave almost every day for breakfast. They are nutritious and delicious and keep me full all the way until lunch. I decided to go with the ""Subscribe and save"" feature and get these for a great price! TL;DR Fantastic!"
"I have used this parchment paper for a long time and am very please with it.  I Bake a lot of bread and line my pans with it.  I put the dough to rise on a paper lined rimless baking sheet and when ready to bake, I slide it onto the baking stone, paper and dough together.  I have reused the same sheet over and over. TL;DR Like it!"
Very good 5 minute meal.  My son can't get enough of them.  The Amazon price is substantially better than any other I have found. TL;DR Really yummy and the best price around.
Who's the nut that thinks someone is stupid enough to buy this coffee at such elevated prices?<br /> you should be ashamed of yourself. TL;DR stupid prices
"When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!! TL;DR Overpriced - not 18lb bags!"
"My K-cup holder is full of various brands of coffee but for me it is Green Mountain, Nantucket Blend.  Buying from Amazon has always been a good experience: price is right, arrival as promised and, if purchased correctly,i.e. quantity, etc., postage free.  The various brands in the K-cup holder shall remain for guests. TL;DR Kcup Favorites"
"I love this flavor. I live in colorado, though, so the shipping is costly. It can only be a very rare treat, as I think the cost of the product and the shipping came to over 2.00 a bottle. Glad it is still out there somewhere, though. TL;DR Great flavor, but......"
My husband loves this soup. We add things to it to thicken it up and also use less water. TL;DR Very pleasant
"I haven't used it for broth per se, but it is excellent as my seasoning base for greens, black-eye peas and limas!  Tastes great! TL;DR great stuff!"
"I loved this movie as a kid, but now ordering it for my 9 year old, I was shocked to watch it again and hear not only several profane words, but the ""f"" bomb, as well as many sexual references. I think they were a bit lax in their rating system back then-- definately more of a PG-13. TL;DR PG? Not!"
"I tried the cranberry almond and it is excellent! The Goji Berry is equally as good.I enjoy this Oatmeal because it is Nutritious,easy to prepare, tasty, maintains its texture when cooked and can be prepared with a variety of liquids. So you can be creative when cooking.You can be assured that you are enjoying an excellent breakfast when you eat this product. I will buy it again!! Thank You Holly!!!!!!!! TL;DR murphyx3"
"This product is packaged in plastic bottles.  I buy all of my spices, extracts, etc. in glass containers only. I would not have ordered this had I known it was shipped in plastic bottles. Because the price was low, we discarded the un-opened plastic bottles rather than try to return them. TL;DR Plastic bottles"
"I am the only coffee drinker in my family of five.  And I am not a die hard coffee drinker at that.  For years I've been trying to coerce someone else in the family to drink coffee w/ me so that my coffee maker can be brought out of the cabinet at least occasionally.  Fortunately, my teen daughter agreed to drink coffee w/ me if I would buy this Chocolate Velvet, which we found in a local grocery store.  She loved it, and now we enjoy heating up the pot every morning.  This coffee is a medium roast with just a hint of chocolate.  Very smooth flavor.  We enjoy it w/ sugar and half 'n' half.  Well worth a try, especially if you can get a small sample bag.  Just noticed that Amazon offers this flavor in decaf, so I will be switching to that when our current bag is gone.  Probably won't be long! TL;DR Enjoyed w/ a new coffee buddy"
"I've always made homemade vegan mac 'n cheese, but it was a little time consuming.  Finally, I found this product.  While it's not as good as my homemade, of course, it is an excellent choice for a quick meal.  I love nutritional yeast, which is a main flavor in this box, but for those who aren't familiar with it, it may be a slightly odd flavoring.  Not bad at all, just different.  Especially if you're expecting it to taste like traditional mac 'n cheese from the blue box.  If you like nutritional yeast you'll love this box.  If you've never had nutritional yeast, give it a try!! TL;DR Finally, a vegan mac from a box!"
"Heat-wise, this is on par with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DG55M"">Blairs After Death</a>.  It isn't as hot as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DID5R"">Dave's Insanity</a>, but is still plenty hot enough to get most peoples' attention.  It has a nice unique flavor that is great on sandwiches, wraps, chicken, pork, and many other dishes.  If you like the heat level of Blairs After Death but want to try a different flavor, this is worth trying. TL;DR good stuff"
"I ordered this product a while back because of its superfood benefits such as increased energy.  I'm not quite sure how to explain the flavor but when I add it to my smoothie made with very sweet strawberries and oranges it remind me of a sweet tart. I have never tried it alone. When I did use this consistently for a couple of weeks, I found I had increased energy. I would definitely order it again. TL;DR I liked it."
"Tender, not too sweet or salty or BBQ flavored, and best of all no nitrates (for those like me who have a sensitivity to them). Better flavor and texture than any beef jerky I've ever had. I love this stuff... unfortunately I've only been able to find it at one convenience store so far, and it's nowhere near my house! Not very convenient. Irony?<br /><br />Anyway, I hope Amazon and/or some grocery stores near me start carrying this stuff soon. It's freakin' amazing! TL;DR Best Jerky EVER"
This coffee beverage tasted pretty good...it was strong but slightly bitter so I couldn't see myself drinking it every day.  The caffeine gave me a nice morning boost.  The calories aren't too bad for this kind of drink. TL;DR Strong...with a jolt
"Product came very well packaged, small cooler pack to keep chocolates form melting, I live in miami and this was one of my concerns, the chocolates were delicious a real hit in the office, extra caffeine was needed, would recommend and buy again, TL;DR excellente."
"My dog, (a one year old female Great Dane) eats her way through a normal rawhide bone in under a hour. Not with this one. You'll notice three things with this, and the other Chunky Chews items, right away.<br />First, they're a lot heavier than normal rawhide.<br />Second, they sound and feel more like plastic or wood when you tap on them or hit them.<br />Third, they reek of quality construction.<br />Later you'll also learn that they aren't messy and the dyes don't transfer either. What I mean when I say they aren't messy, is that there always seems to be a dry place to grab this ring by. Unlike a normal rawhide that feels like slime when the dog's leaves it laying somewhere and you need to move it.<br />I've tried, (I should rephrase that to ""my dog has tried"") all the different flavors and shapes of rawhide they offer from Chunky Chews, and the ring, in either flavor, is the longest lasting and best value for the $. The other shapes are also long lasting and made very well, but they don't have the durability of this shaped toy. And considering it only costs a couple dollars more than the other shapes it's well worth the extra 2-3 $.<br />If your dog has anything less than a chainsaw far a mouth, this toy will last. TL;DR Rawhide Ring from Hell!"
"At last a marmalade that reminds me of that which I had when I was a youngster<br /><br />Flavor, texture, consistency is ""on the money."" Try it...you'll be more than satisfied.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for picking up a product that is truly outstanding. TL;DR A WINNER !"
Love this rice and will order again. Cooks up nicely in microwave. I recommend this product  to anyone that likes brown rice. TL;DR Village Harvest Organic Brown Rice
"I have been buying the plum baby organics food pouches (which I still love) and thought I could try making homemade baby food to give my baby different combos of food that the pouches and other store brands didn't offer. I have had every machine (Baby Beaba, Baby Bullet and Baby Chef) and they were all returned. Finally I found the Brezza! Super easy to use, has a great steam option (which was what I missed in the baby bullet) and easy to clean. Couldn't be happier with this product and now I can make fun food combos. Also, I usually buy products from Amazon however this time I bought from Babies R Us.  They were running a special where if you bought the food maker you got the spatula and cutting board attachment for free. TL;DR Feel like a ""real"" chef"
"I use this wonderful product daily by mixing 3 or 4 tablespoons with orange juice or Sunny D for fiber.  After years of purchasing flax seed at the health food stores at a much higher price, I decided to try this product.  This has become my product of choice in an ongoing battle with constipation.  In addition, my cholesterol numbers have been great and I attribute that to the omega 3 in the flax seed I take daily.  I split each shipment with a girlfriend and she has noticed an improvement in her cholesterol numbers also. No more need for laxatives or stool softeners, which are more expensive.  Must be drank immediately after mixing, or it will thicken.  Great taste, easy going down.  One day, I'll try baking something with this product. TL;DR Flax Seed for Fiber"
Best quality and taste !! I use this product alot and it is consistently above all other products. Comes highly recommended. TL;DR Must buy
What can I say??? This is delicious on any day.  Sip til your heart's content. TL;DR Chocolate Heaven
"Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal! TL;DR Sweet with a nice kick!"
"First of all, 10 days ago Amazon ran this coffee on a great special, about $4.70 per pound.  This was my first try; I should have bought more because Amazon has about doubled the price in less than two weeks.  This is a medium blend and grind as advertised.  The top is tightly sealed; it was the hardest pull off top that I've ever encountered, and you could hear the air express as it was opened.  The aroma is great in the can, when brewing, and in the cup. The taste is, for me, somewhat artificial although not obnoxious, but it cost a star in my book.  There is no residual acidity or aftertaste.  The expiration date is fine, at May 2012; it won't last anywhere near that long. TL;DR Good coffee, good value"
This ginger ale is made with sugar not corn syrup and contains real ginger.  It is refreshing and the smaller can if the perfect serving TL;DR real ginger ale
"These South Beach Diet Bars are extremely delicious...I purchased the Almond Snack Bar that is whipped, so it is light on your stomach while it fills you up...it satisfies your hunger and chocolate craving...it is an excellent choice to grab for a quick snack...I'm diabetic so this is a good choice for me, since it is low in carbs and calories...it is also high in protein and is a good source of fiber...the taste and texture are perfect and I really enjoy eating them...I highly recommend them and I plan to order some more very soon...I order mine from Amazon and I received them quickly at a good price...I order all of my supplies from Amazon and get excellent service so I highly recommend that you order from Amazon, also...try the South Beach Diet Bars, I'm sure you will enjoy them and get great service by ordering from Amazon. TL;DR South Beach Diet Bars"
"Beware of this product--I always shop on Amazon and figured why not get my dogs something--well these were cheap and seemed like such a good price for a big supply of treats---and if you are buying dog treats, you know how expensive they can be....well, I don't have 100% proof that the treats did this to my dog, but the week I was giving these to my lab and to my other dog, a maltese, the lab was getting sick throughout the week--throwing up, etc....I don't know if he was not eating them properly--maybe he wasn't chewing them all the way up, but he doesn't always chew up food and doesn't throw it up---I don't know--I hate to blame these treats, but when we stopped giving them to him, he stopped throwing up---so I think something was wrong w/them.....just use caution--a cheap price isn't all that cheap when your dog gets sick and you spend 3x as much on cleaning products to clean up your house!!  My maltese didn't seem to be bothered by them, but then again he really didn't eat but maybe one of them---another sign that something must have been wrong w/them as he eats ANYTHING!!! TL;DR DO NOT BUY--My dog got sick!"
"These were so good and highly addictive.  None arrived broken, which was a plus for heating them in the toaster.  I had to withdrawal myself from them gradually.  A great instant breakfast for on the way to work. TL;DR frosted strawberry poptarts"
This sample pack came with some great flavors and introduced me in to my all time favorite now and it's the Wild Mountain Blueberry! Delish! TL;DR Great flavors
"I've been feeding my little guys Natural Balance for a while now and they love it. Their coats have never been shinier and meal time is always a breeze. They're not huge fans of NB's wet food, but the dry is at the top of their list. I love the fact that it's grain-free and the price is very good for what you get. A 10-lb bag usually lasts me about a month since I mix it with wet food. Definitely worth it for your furry friend. TL;DR 5 Paws Up!"
"I was very pleased with the size of the boxes, they are movie-theater size. Also, the expiration date on the box they came in says they expire in 2013, so I guess they aren't supposed to go stale anytime soon. I doubt I'll have them that long though! Still it's nice to know that I'm getting a fresh product that won't get old before I have a chance to use it. I'd rather have some candy squirreled away for those sugar cravings then waste it on spontaneous purchases at the gas station where the candy is over-priced. The first time I bought a case of candy from Amazon I felt a bit ridiculous, but the expiration date is always at least 6 months out. Sometimes it's nice to have the extra candy around for the holidays too, to throw in a stocking, or Easter basket. I like that there is a variety of flavors, because one flavor could get boring for an entire case. TL;DR Movie Theatre size, good value!"
"Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him. TL;DR not much better than I the salmon flavored one."
"This tea is wonderful. Don't let the ""white tea"" put you off, it's really more of a light earl grey with a subtle hint of rose. It does have caffeine in it. If you are a tea-drinker I would definitely suggest you check out this tea, the subtle aroma of rose, but not heavily perfumed taste, is very uplifting. TL;DR Great value"
"Not too long ago, our daughter arrived at our house after a year away from home with bags full of clothes that were full of moths. To this day, she rejects that notion that she brought such a scourge to our family home, but the facts speak for themselves. The day before our daughter arrived home, there was not a moth to be found. The day after she landed and unceremoniously dumped her bags in the front hall closet, I opened the door to that same closet and turned on the light only to be met by the frantic flutterings of a newly arrived population of moths that were scurrying as quickly as their little dusty wings could take them into the dark corners, away from my dropped jaw and curses. I took action immediately. First, I closed the door, hoping for containment. Second, I gently scolded my daughter with the reminder that, unlike her, we actually enjoyed the pleasure of a clean, vermin-free home. Third, I went online to check out the relative safety of the more toxic insecticides such as ""moth crystals"" that kill everything--adults, larva, and eggs. Fourth, I decided that I could not seal the hall closet tightly enough to prevent toxic fumes of the conventional insecticides from entering our living space; Fifth, I searched for safer alternatives and found...you guessed it...Safer Brand 7270 Clothes Moth Alert Trap. I read the mixed reviews for Safer Brand. Many were promising, but some were halfhearted. Having wrestled with all manner of crawling interlopers in my home (lice, fleas, etc.), I concluded that the less enthusiastic reviews were most likely a result of user error or, at the very least, the purchaser's own lack of diligence in follow through after correctly applying the product. I, on the other hand, am one of those classic obsessive compulsive types who takes on a challenge like this with the determination of a marathon runner (make that ""triathlete""). My husband would smirk at such an analogy since the only experience I have that even approximates exercise is the vigorous typing I do on my computer; but, hey, one finds analogies where one can, right? So, on with the story. After reading the instructions and carefully positioning about three traps in every closet of my home, I also followed up with a thorough vacuuming of each closet and put the more seductive wool/silk items into thick, black, plastic bags (the kind you get at the hardware store that are usually called ""Contractor's Bags""). I also installed a third tier of defense by placing a few bowls of cedar balls in each closet. Finally, I left one small wool scrap hanging in each closet to lure the moths. I am nothing if not devious. Then, I waited. In fact, I was gone for several weeks on vacation, and when I returned, much moth activity had occurred. The verdict? The traps worked wonderfully when combined with my other ""moth attack"" measures. The corpses of dead, desiccated moths littered the traps. There were no holes or visible eggs on the wool ""lure,"" but I disposed of those scraps just to be safe. Then, I continued to search for moths in the less accessible parts of the closet--higher up on the walls, in the seams between carpet and baseboard, and in all the ceiling corners. I found no moth activity. I replaced the first batch of traps with a second round after a few months, and I continue to have zero moths to this day. End of story. TL;DR If used properly, Safer Brand effectively controls moths"
"I have been drinking these for over 3 years and I love it.  I drink it at home, work, before/after the gym... anytime really.  I find myself more hydrated and consuming more than water alone because of the light flavor this has to offer.  Great product!  I wish there was more flavors. TL;DR Love it... make more flavors."
"I'll leave others to comment on the taste, but since someone mentioned the lack of trans fat, I just want to point out this is NOT a healthy drink, in case anyone thinks it is, because it's mostly sugar. I don't want to get too deep into nutritional debates but you can find out on your own. The bottom line is, added sugar, in any form, is very bad, even you're managing calories perfectly. TL;DR Great taste but know what it is"
"We tried this popcorn after the local grocery store had it on sale.  We loved it.  Not salty, and chemical tasting like others.  reminded me of the popcorn we made in the hand popper.  I checked with the manufacturers website and if you let them know you want it, they will let your retailer know. However, it is bag for bag cheaper here.<br />We had no problems popping it using the 3.0oz popcorn button on our 1000 watt micro. TL;DR Great Popcorn"
"I am pleased at how quickly the fondant came. I have not tried it yet, as I am waiting for by first fondant attempt for a wedding shower. *fingers crossed* TL;DR Delivered, Stat!"
"I have been doing a low carb diet for a year now, and I love these. They are a great snack between meals and I really like the taste of them. The pizza is my fav. so far. TL;DR Yummy!"
"These are the best Cucumbers I have ever grown! I planted some last season and they really are ""Sweet Success"". They are the easiest seeds to start and grow like crazy. Keep them off the ground on some type of trellis or tomato cage and you will get cucumbers that average 2 to 3 lbs each. No kidding, these cucumbers were as big as the Zucchini we grew! They grow to be huge and can be between 12 to 16 inches long. They never turned bitter and we couldn't eat or give them away fast enough. There growing season was long here in So. California. I planted in the ground in April and picked the last cucubers on Christmas day. They were still delicious...<br /><br />I had some seeds left over from last season and they sprouted in just a few days.<br /><br />I will buy these again as soon as I see them available. TL;DR Please Get These Back In Stock !!!"
"Package arrived on time & as advertised.  I should've bought 3 or 4 since I'm already out.  I'll order again for sure. TL;DR By gum, that's good!"
"cereal is really tasting with the maple, not only for breakfast but during the day, WHOLESOME, HEALTHY i usually have it with cup of mixed fruit on the side TL;DR Deliciuos breakfast or anytime"
"I purchased this coffee medley because it looked good in the advertisement. When I got it, the medley was TOO diverse and contained stuff I did not like. TL;DR A coffee medley"
"This is a great mix of Torani flavors at a great price! The only thing I would change is instead of regular chocolate, I would prefer white chocolate.<br />Good variety - you can have a coffee house in your own home. TL;DR Great choices"
"Excellent K-cup coffee . Robust, flavorful and almost as bold as advertised.  One of my favorites.  Worth a try TL;DR Black Tiger dark roast"
"***<br /><br />One thing I don't like about PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound is the price as offered on Amazon right now.<br /><br />I do like the bag, though.  One reason is there's a photograph of a dog on the front, and that dog looks really startled.  It's kind of arresting, and you find yourself doing a double-take, because you so rarely see a dog look startled, with great big wide-open eyes.  Also, he's wearing a police badge on his collar because he's a police dog.  (Arresting, get it?)<br /><br />Another reason I like the Beneful bag is that Eukanuba, my dogs' normal brand, comes in a paper bag with a grease-proof liner whereas the product under review comes in a sturdy plastic bag, like thick Tyvek, that has a simple zip-type closure with a little handle that works every time.  I like the bag so much that I now store excess Eukanuba in it.  Also, last time I bought a bag of Eukanuba and placed it on the floor of the backseat of my car, a woman backed out in front of me and I had to hit the brakes quickly, which meant that my dog, which was also in the backseat, got thrown forward and ended up falling off the seat where, unbeknownst to me, he placed a foot right into the middle of the Eukanuba paper bag and punched a paw-size hole all the way through both layers, which would not have happened with the Beneful bag.  Imagine my surprise when I pulled the bag from the backseat and strewed dog food pellets all over the car and the garage floor.<br /><br />I was not surprised the dog did not set about snarfing down the food he had liberated from its bag, and here's why.<br /><br />***<br /><br />AD LIB FEEDING<br /><br />I have successfully fed all my pets, five cats [see update at bottom] and two dogs so far over the years, ad lib, and I strongly recommend you try it.  Ad lib is short for the Latin phrase ad libitum, which means ""at liberty"" or ""at one's pleasure.""  Feeding ad lib means you eat as much as you want.<br /><br />The benefit of my pets' feeding ad lib throughout their lives is that I can leave out weeks' worth of food at a time rather than having to measure and dole out portions every day.  From the moment I've gotten each new pet home the first time, I've always made sure there was a huge amount of food available in their feeding vessels.  When they come to realize there will always be more food than they can possibly eat all at once, they automatically regulate their feeding to what they need.  None of those pets ever overfed themselves.<br /><br />If you ration out one day's worth of food a day, those pets will always eat it all up and wait for the next day's feeding, which they will always eat up.  They will quickly realize that the supply of food per day is limited, and they will want to always eat all of it, which means you must then continue to limit their daily portions lest they overeat.  Ad lib feeding is MUCH better.<br /><br />I feed my current dog -- which is also the best dog in the world and I can prove it -- from a tub that holds 30 pounds of Eukanuba.  I feed my current cat -- which is the prettiest cat for miles but socially inept -- from a large emesis basin I stole from my mother's hospital room several years ago.  (Hi, Mom, and I'm glad you didn't need to throw up!)  As a result I have to add dog food maybe once every couple months and cat food every three.  Let's compare ad lib feeding to daily feedings.<br /><br />Whether they feed on rationed daily portions or ad lib, your pets will need you to do the following each time you feed them:<br /><br />1. Locate and haul out the container of the pet's food.<br /><br />2. Open the container.<br /><br />3. Dose out the food into the pet's feeding vessel.<br /><br />4. Seal and store the container of the pet's food.<br /><br />If you perform these steps once a day for one dog and one cat, that's 730 such operations in a year.<br /><br />The way I do it, it works out to only about ten such feedings a year.  That's 73 times better, which is why I say ad lib feeding is better.<br /><br />But, just to make sure you understand, (1) you want to get your pet started on ad lib feeding the instant it gets home, and (2) you want to make sure its feeding vessel never gets too close to empty.  Your pet should always be able to see and smell that there's always more food than it can eat.  As I said, this has worked for me for a total of seven cats and dogs [see update at bottom] out of a total of seven dogs and cats in the sense that none of them has ever overfed.<br /><br />***<br /><br />My current dog, whose name is PheyeG'hdeaux, really prefers Beneful to Eukanuba.  Maybe it's because he got bored with Eukanuba and wanted a change of taste.  You know how if you eat your favorite food for too long even it, your very most favoritest food, starts to pall?  Maybe dogs are the same way.  It seem like they would be.  Cats too, and giraffes and hamsters and monkey-eating eagles, I would guess.  I know my dog prefers Beneful to Eukanuba because when I mxed the two in his tub he actually went to the trouble of rooting through the various pebbles to track down the Beneful ones.<br /><br />(People who've had a chance to observe and learn about PheyeG'hdeaux agree he's the smartest dog ever.  He learned Shake, Sit and Down in fifteen minutes, although to be fair he was trained by Annette, who is and always will be a former professional dog trainer, although to be fair she says she wasn't training dogs, she was training dog owners.  Anyway, to be fair, PheyeG'hdeaux isn't all THAT smart, and the reason I say that is that I beat him a good four out of five times in chess.  I'm all the time having to remind him about elementary things like, ""Don't bring your queen out too early"" and ""Don't forget about capturing en passant.""  Sheesh.  None of this has anything to with how good Beneful is or is not, which is why it's in parentheses.)<br /><br />I am concerned that the first ingredient in PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound is corn-based.  Humans don't process a lot of corn well, as you (ahem) might have observed, and I'm just guessing dogs don't either.  (Now I have to tell you about how, according to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316082678"">Bartlett's Book of Anecdotes</a>, ""After receiving a bad review from Munich critic Rudolf Louis, [German composer and organist Max] Reger wrote to him: 'I am sitting in the smallest room of my house.  I have your review before me.  In a moment it will be behind me.'"")  Also, if I may be permitted to continue in this indelicate vein, on Beneful PheyeG'hdeaux's, er, gaseous emissions have a different smell, although I can't say it's necessarily any better than when they're fueled by Eukanuba.  Funny how dog food manufacturers never discuss this particular asspect of the ingredients they choose, don't you think?<br /><br />Finally, as some of you might have come to expect, I have taken the product under review outside the expected criteria such as, in this case, nutritional value and price and convenience and taste.  I can tell you that when you grind up this Beneful into a dust and sprinkle it on a Caesar salad, it remains unimproved.  The salad, I mean.  Same with pizza.<br /><br />And especially ice cream.  Beneful dog food dust is truly awful on almost every flavor of ice cream.  But then, to be fair, so is Eukanuba dust.<br /><br />Also, if you pour some into cereal bowls and serve them to your kids with a spoon and a carton of milk, they will not eat a second bite no matter what you do or say, which is too bad because this Beneful dog food, even at the price at which it's on offer at Amazon right now, is a lot cheaper than the same weight of corn flakes.  And, come to think of it, the main ingredient is the same.<br /><br />Did you figure out how to pronounce PheyeG'hdeaux?<br /><br />***<br /><br />UPDATE OF JULY 27, 2012:<br /><br />Since I wrote the review above, a sixth cat has been added to the list of pets that feed successfully ad lib, so it's eight dogs and cats, not a mere seven. TL;DR It's OK"
"My boyfriend always want to have a small elegant bonsai and I got this for him. He absolutely love it! It came with careful wrap (actually, not quite easy to unwrap it ^^) and detail instruction about how to take care of it. The only thing frustrated us is the pot. One of the stand is shorter than the rest three so we have to add a foot-pad to adjust the height. Except that, we are very happy with the purchase. TL;DR beautiful bosai with disappointed pot"
"We have tried this a few times. Firstly I never seem to get it fully rehydrated, so I end up giving it to our pup as a soup. He eats it, but is not a big fan. It smells exactly like cup-o-soup or ramen and if you read the ingredients that is about what it is. I recommend that if you want to try it, DON'T start with the beef. Our dog is NOT a fan. The turkey is fine. All the flavors are the same they only swap out the meat. TL;DR go for turkey if first time"
These rolls are superior to the name brands sold in most supermarkets.  Purchasing 6 tins is also more economical. TL;DR Dolcetto Chocolae Wafer Rolls
This brown gravy is delicious and perfect for vegetarians.  I cannot get it at my health food store anymore so it's nice to know I can order it on Amazon. TL;DR Vegetarian Brown Gravy
Love this Gynormous box of pop tarts!  I bought it for the kids to take with them on the go as they are running out the door and they need to bring a snack with them!  It has been a life saver! TL;DR LIFESAVER
"I was skeptical when I tried this, but boy what a delight.  The flavor is deep but not too heavy, and the carbonation is just right; it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the juice.  It actually has a good ""mouth-feel"" - I drank it 15 minutes ago, and I can still feel a little hint of it.  It's like I had a thin slice of fresh kiwi and strawberry melting in my mouth. TL;DR Unbelievable good"
"Other reviews said the packaging was inadequate, broken or not air tight.  That was not my experience.  Arrived in good condition (I checked every bottle for a proper seal).  The sauce is very good compared to store brands and the price is reasonable considering the quality. TL;DR Packaging is fine"
"Love these! Got one as a gift a couple of years ago and my wife and I reorder them every so often. They make for a great Sunday Funday in the backyard and they are fun when guests come over. We also like the other flavors, but the Wine-a-Rita is my favorite. TL;DR Yummy and refreshing"
"Wonderful all natural snack, with it coming in boxes of 6 I know there'll be rice pudding with currants in my future TL;DR Yum!"
"I have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good I must say to my family and I that this is the best! I have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that. Nice flavor, great texture, well worth the price! I have bought this a few times on Amazon and will continue to do so! TL;DR My Fave Hodgson Mill Bread Mix!"
This pretty gift basket contains 8 samples of morsels that are great to go along with a cup of coffee. They are in a pretty basket with a gold ribbon / bow. It contains the following: Kettle Fresh Chocolate Fudge; Truffle Cookies; Caramelized Belgian Cookies; Chocolate Milano Biscotti; Cashew Roca; Dolcetto Cookies; Sweet Butter Cookies and Chocolate Chip Cookies. This would make a great gift for a friend. TL;DR Nice gift
"I've tried all kinds of gluten-free crackers and these are by far the best!  I have found no other rice crackers that even come close to this taste.  Even my friends who don't care about the gluten-free feature love them.  They're great with salsa, hummus, cheese or just plain.  Even my cat eats them. TL;DR The best gluten-free crackers I've found!"
"I began using this 2 nights ago as a nightly moisturizer and I'm already seeing positive results.  Other than occasional pimples, my only skip issue was wrinkles beginning to appear (I'm only 22 so either I don't drink enough water or I'm way too stressed for my age).  Though the deeper wrinkles have not completely disappeared, they are definitely diminished and barely noticeable unless you're very close to my forehead.  Love this so far! (And it smells wonderful!) TL;DR So far so good!"
GROVE STREET HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE KEURIG.  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE HOT CHOCOLATE AVAILABLE TO SOOTHE AWAY THE DAYS ANXIETIES! TL;DR I LOVE THIS HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE KEURIG!
"This is the coffee I love, thank you so much for offering it as the last supplier stopped selling it.  I will continue to get it forever! TL;DR Happy!"
"These are a great go-to snack/meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.<br /><br />The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy with a nice tang.<br /><br />The texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausage.<br /><br />Quick comment on quantity - there are three servings, 60 calories each, in the package.  This ends up being a little over a handful for the entire package.<br /><br />Great to have on hand for those on the go times. TL;DR Downright Addictive!"
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this oatmeal.  It is perfect for someone who is trying to loose weight because it really keeps you full.  I bring mine to work and fill it with water from the hot water tap on the water cooler (works perfectly). This oatmeal is an easy breakfast or snack for someone that doesn't have a lot of time to plan/pack a lunch/snack. TL;DR DELICIOUS!!!
"err, this must be our second load and it is so great for you: minimum additives, raisins and 60% dark chocolate: delicious if this is already part of your regular diet!  it is hard to find good healthy snacks with minimum processes and still satify the sweet tooth.<br /><br />my hubbie and I share this when we watch a movie and the portion is about right for a one a day treat. TL;DR Cant stop eating them"
"I came across these gummys at the video rental store, my wife and I quickly became addicted. The store went out of business and closed a short while after. We were in crisis mode. I quickly scoured  the internet and found this little gummy, gold-mine on Amazon. I bought two cases and after devouring them with my wife and dog, I am about to order more.<br /><br />The candies are just like they were at the video store, same quality, box and everything, the only difference is that they work out to about HALF the price on Amazon than individually at the store. If you love Haribo gummys then you'll especially love these.  While the flavors and texture of the Roulettes are exactly the same as the traditional Haribo Bears in the gold pack, these gummys are a more solid, concentrated, chunk of gummy goodness. They are just a little more chompy than the Bears with all the same juicy flavor. One warning once you buy them: YOU WILL FIND THE EMPTY WRAPPERS EVERYWHERE :) TL;DR Best gummy ever!"
"I really liked this hot drink. The ginger definitely gives it a kick. I drank it when I had a sore throat (and the beginnings of a cold) and it was very soothing. It has a nice sweet taste, but it's not overly sweet. If you're a fan of ginger, I would definitely recommend it. The ginger is very dominant. I'll be trying this again. TL;DR Super Ginger Taste"
"looked for product all over town, another similiar product has the market sewed up. Amazon.com came and saved the ""SUPER BOWL PARTY"" TL;DR good eating"
"Being a fanatic at eating sunflower seeds, I've tried just about all of the brands and many flavors. Without a doult, Spitz's Dill Pickle seeds are my favorite. So much so, I used to buy them by the case from a grocery store in a city about 100 miles away because grocery stores in my area did not carry them. Then I found out I can get them online and have been purchasing them there ever since. The 6oz bags are perfect for in the car or at ball games and the 16oz bags I keep in the house at my favorite recliner. I prefer Spitz brand over others mainly because they don't have a salty taste or leave your mouth feeling num after eating them. TL;DR Spitz Sunflower Seeds"
This is the best sauce I have ever used. I have tried others and this one is tops. I will purchase this one again. TL;DR Bull Dog Sauce
"I'm not a big fan of granola, trail mix, or any other ""health"" bar. My friend (who is a health nut!) gave me one for breakfast while I was at her home. I thought, ""This is going to be nasty."" (LOL) Little did I know that would start an addiction that has lasted for over two years :) The variety box comes with blueberry (my fav), strawberry, tropical, and cranberry. I personally despise all things cranberry and refuse to try those... my terrible nature... but it still works out ok because my family love them all (so I can buy them and know that they will all be eaten!)<br /><br />These are good for my cholesterol and calorie intake (YEAH!) They are a yummy, healthy snack that is not a candy. (YEAH!) If you like nuts, you will love this bar. It also has sunflower and pumpkin seeds. YUMMY! If I had the choice between a Trio bar or a Snickers bar, TRIO would surely win.<br /><br />FYI... After you find out whether or not you enjoy these, you can set up for a monthly (or every other month) shipment and Amazon doesn't charge shipping fees for it this way, which is very cool! Do try. You will enjoy these! :) TL;DR YUMMY! *Even if you're not a health nut!*"
Someone at Amazon clearly made a mistake with the price listed for this case.  This product can easily be purchased on sale for .89 for a 20 oz bottle at any grocery store.  If you offered a competitive price I would have purchased as a reoccuring item. TL;DR LIST PRICE MUST BE A MISTAKE
My chubby female dog lost around 2 inches already. she was getting bigger so fast that she had to get a bigger harness!!!<br />Now she is better. Hope she loses a little more. Also got newman's own organics beef canned food. They're super high in protein and super low in fat and carbs. The dogs LOVE THEM too!! :) TL;DR OMFG..!!!
"This is my go-to seasoning blend now. I wish I had discovered it sooner! I use it on everything...including fish, chicken, pork, shrimp, burgers, steak, potatoes, veggies, and in dry rubs, marinades, soups and stews. I've even been tempted to top my ice cream with it, but so far have been able to restrain myself! :-) For a blackening seasoning, I find it has a nice all-around blend of seasonings, herbs and spices without being too over-the-top spicy or peppery. Flavor is key here...not ""melt your face off"" heat.<br /><br />The larger cansiter is a much better bargain than the little 2 ounce containers, in my opinion. Amazon also has the 2-pack 24 ounce cansiters, and it's what I usually order when I'm running low. If you've never tried this stuff before, pick up the 2 ounce size to see how you like it...when you realize how good it is, you'll be glad Amazon has the big cansiters. TL;DR It's amazing, versatile stuff!"
This is a great product if you like anchovies. It is pretty pricy for its size but cheaper than similar products offered on Amazon. Service from Nettuno was great. TL;DR Anchovy Lover
"Great items,especially if you want to avoid the hassle of cooking.unfortunately,prices on Amazon are way higher than on Walmart.you can find them there at $1.50 a can.what else needs to be said?. TL;DR FAR cheaper elsewhere."
"I am not actually trying to avoid the caffeine in coffee just the tannin (it gives coffee its' color and decaf has a higher amount) and messes my system up.  Cafix is the best substitute I've found since I don't care for a sweet taste.  It might could use a bit more barley but again it is the only substitute I've found that I can use on a consistent basis and enjoy.  Thank  you,  Teresa M. Cawthon TL;DR looking for a great coffee substitute"
"The lavendar is so fragrant, I could smell it on my front step when it arrived. There was a bonus sample of rose buds included with the shipment as well as information and recipies for the lavendar. TL;DR So much lavendar!"
"I don't usually review products, but i wanted to let parents know that gerber will solve constipation problems wihtin 24 hours.  My 8 week daughter has been constipated since week 1, I did formula and breastfeeding together, I tried prune juice, pear juice, chamomile tea, anise tea, Karo, you name it!! changed her formula 5 times (similac, similac sensetive, enfamil gentelease, and similac alimnuntem (it smelled horrible and DD refused to take it, couldn't blame her). a friend recommended probiotics (Biogaia) which helped a lot but was sooo expensive ($30 for 5ml) it only lasted for 1 week. So i finally found Gerber soothe which includes the probiotics. My DD has been so happy ever since!! I also changed bottles to the (dr. brown) which really helped with gas...hope this helps!! TL;DR Love you Gerber...no more constipation"
My 13 month old son loves these!  He thinks they taste great and they are less messy than all the other biscuts that are out there.  I love how they are packed in bags of two so they won't go stale and they are easy to throw in the diaper bag when we go out.  I am also happy how they don't have any ingredients that I wouldn't want to feed to my son.  There isn't any soy in them and it is usually hard to find food that doesn't have any soy in it.  I also love the price for it being organic! TL;DR Best Snack Ever
"The Breadshop's 'Crunchy Oat Bran' granola tastes OK. I've had much better tasting granolas for less money. But my biggest disappointment is with the texture. I like granola with crunchy clusters and this cereal lacks that. The cereal consists of small bits that are relatively uniform in size and it impresses me as a 'whole' food that has been over-processed. I'd give it three stars for taste, two stars for value, and one star for texture, which averages two stars. TL;DR Granola without clusters"
I love this product. I have a hot cuppa with a tablespoon of Honey every morning. It taste great and the cinnamon and honey seem to help with my seasonal allergies. TL;DR Texas Mom
"I try to avoid having too much nutrisweet/aspartame, the sweetener in most diet drinks, because it can make me feel crappy after a while.  But I've always loved the little crystal light powders similar to these, so I finally went on the hunt for an alternative and decided to order ""Totally Light.""<br /><br />Win!<br /><br />They're just as good at Crystal Light and theyr'e sweetened with Splenda/sucralose, which I MUCH prefer.  The variety packs, like this one, also appear to be a better price than if you order all one flavor. Yet another win! TL;DR Great Alternative to Crystal Light!"
this is a very easy product put just a little in makes a awesome serving of cotton candy that everyone will love TL;DR very fun and tasty easy to use
"These are very tasty, i would recommend them to mothers who are smart enough to realize that processed sugar is bad for you. TL;DR Excellent"
"I bought this gum about three weeks ago and have never been more disappointed in a product. When you first chew up the pieces the taste is anything but spearmint. But it gets worse as you continue to chew it; what flavor there is disappears in less than 2-3 minutes and it is just plain nasty!<br /><br />As bad as the gum is, I also tried the Xyla mints and find them to be wonderful. The flavors I like most are: Wintergreen, Coco mint, Peppermint. Licorice mint is also pretty good. TL;DR Don't buy this stuff!"
the perfect snack and the perfect popcorn for my family.  lots of flavor.  there is no better popcorn out there! my family won't let me buy any other brand. TL;DR the best!
"This had a very clean and nice flavor! It makes Swasons taste like water and I do like the fact its from free range chickens and not some egg laying factory chickens that get boiled up after they live a short, brutal life in tiny cages. Its bad for the chickens, bad for our health and bad for our karma. This made a great soup base and everyone enjoyed it. TL;DR Flavorful!"
"I ordered this tea both for myself and as a gift (since it comes as a pack of 2).  The tea is packaged well for freshness, and it smells and tastes GREAT!  I recommend using 1.5 teaspoonfuls of tea to each 8 ounces of water, steep for 3.5 minutes.  I will definitely be reordering this tea once I start to get low on this batch.  Thanks, Octavia, for a great loose leaf tea product! TL;DR Very Yummy Tea"
"I thought I was getting K-Cups for my Keurig Brewer but instead this was nothing more than packets of hot chocolate mix to add to my hot water.  I don't need a special brewer for this and the chocolate is the same as if I'd bought the regular Ghirardelli Hot Cocoa mix.  Granted, Ghirardelli makes really good hot cocoa but don't spend the extra money just because the description says ""specially designed for Keurig"".<br /><br />I haven't tried them yet, but Green Mountain has recently come out with real hot cocoa K-Cups.  I just ordered a box from another website and if Amazon carries them later, I'll let you know if they're good. TL;DR Very disappointing"
"I was a huge fan of GFIC's Italian Cappuccino and was really unhappy when they quit making it, so when I saw this, same maker, same name, I thought I was getting the same product. Completely wrong. This item has a similar texture to their Swiss Mocha (liquid is somewhat thickened), and the flavor is totally different (again, more like Swiss Mocha). Would have been nice to know that it's a vending machine pack. Doesn't mix as well by hand. TL;DR Not the same Italian Cappuccino"
We currently have 3 cats and have been feeding Taste of the Wild for almost a year.  My cats love this stuff.  They run to the bowl to eat.  The best is however the reaction on their coats.  No more problems with itchy skin and hair loss because of grains that are in most pet foods.  Outstanding product!!!!! The only wish is that it would be be in larger sizes TL;DR Brings out the Wild
"After years of watching my older miniature schnauzer, Cosmo, suffer very bad itching, especially along the back, and starting to see the younger one get it too, it was truly a blessing to find this product which pretty much brought an end to their itching.<br />I've almost forgotten the sound of the chair hitting the table as Cosmo steps back and forth with his back under the chair's lower horizontal wood planks -scratching all of his hair off, and eventually his skin, but I still have pictures of the bloody red patches.<br />Thank you, Chicken Soup, for making a healthy natural product that doesn't give my dogs terrible skin reactions. TL;DR Cured dogs' bad skin"
"Not my favorite popping corn by far.<br />Fickle to pop.<br />Suggestion:  add coconut oil, add corn kernels, then turn heat on medium low with lid on pot, shake after a few minutes.  Be careful not to burn, and don't over pop. The remaining ones won't pop, you will only end up burning your batch.  You will have quite a few left un popped.<br />Add melted butter and sea salt, not bad.<br />Not better than cheap store brands found in plastic bags in your local grocery store, colors are fun though. TL;DR Just ok"
"Wonderful bold brew. Stands alone or with Hazelnut, Vanilla or half and half w/sugar or not, too. Tully's great blend! C'est Magnifique! TL;DR C'est Magnifique!"
I ate the noodles for dinner with spaghetti sauce at 7pm. I started feeling nauseous a few hours later which continued through the night. At @7am the next morning I vomited up the undigested noodles. Won't be eating those again. TL;DR Careful!!!
"Someone has given me a box of the assorted chocolates.<br />Do any of you ever read the ingredients?<br />An absolutely horrible stuff.<br />Wouldn't you expect for the Monks to make their own product<br />that is not only delicious but also free of all the carcinogenic coloring,high fructose corn syrup etc..etc.. etc..I wonder where on Earth are they getting all these ingredients? TL;DR full of poisons"
"Didn't like the flavor or the taste at all...nothing close to any cappuccino I ever had. Totally disappointed and now I am not sure what to do with remaining 52 cups!<br />Don't waste money by buying bulk, try one first if you could get it. TL;DR Not sure what to do with remain 52 k-cups :("
My daughter loves this cereal.  It has become her new favorite and she eats a bowl every morning.  It is not too sweet and still healthy.  (I am also a celiac and this is a bit too peanut buttery for me in the morning...) TL;DR Great cereal for my Celiac daughter
"I ordered a case of these a few weeks ago and while they are made with cracker material they are not crackers they are a cross between bread crumbs and crutons.  Not one cracker, in any of the boxes, are within ten percent of whole.  They are all pulverized!  There was no damage on the outer case, or any of the inners, but they look like they were either dropped from the 78th floor or tossed into the truck at 100 MPH.  It's total loss.  I would not chance it again. TL;DR I would call them Bread Crumbs not Crackers"
"Just like all the other flavors of Anna's thins. A real winner. Must be diet food, no? TL;DR Very tasty"
"I buy these dates from a local market in Houston, and I go through a box in about a week or two .. they're so good ..<br /><br />Yes, some of them are dry (which I prefer), and some are soft.  It really depends on the batch, but you get a bit of both in each package (ratios vary per package).<br /><br />Dates go perfect with nuts.  whether it's walnuts or almonds, but I found ""blue diamond oven roasted sea salt almonds"" to be a perfect match.  I stuff each date with 1 or 2 almonds, and I get a perfect combination of sweet and salty .. try it!<br /><br />This is an excellent snack that has lots of fiber, and it tastes great! TL;DR Wonderful Daily Snack"
This stuff tastes great!!  We love this in pasta sauce and on pizza.  I'm sure it has many other uses too which I will try.  We bought some at a fair but I cannot find it at any store so I'm glad they carry it on Amazon. TL;DR I love this stuff!
"Watery, weak, no coffee flavor & the chocolate flavor is very odd. Seriously, a packet of Swiss Miss blows this away. Whether they call this a coffee or a cocoa, it's a terrible rendition of either.  Good thing my kids like it so it gets used up! TL;DR Terrible coffee and/or cocoa!"
"I bought this Maple Syrup based on the reviews of this product and I am very pleased.<br /><br />In the past I had always purchased Grade A Maple Syrup at the market. I was not even<br />aware of a Grade B. However, I have found the Grade B to be very robust and full<br />flavored on my Belgian Waffles for breakfast.<br /><br />A great way to start the day! TL;DR VERY EXCELLENT"
"I was expecting this to taste like a store-bought frappaccino,sweet and creamy but with that ""factory produced"", in-genuine edge to it. I was surprised that it tastes more like something you'd pick up from a coffee house though! The actual coffee bean flavor stands out in a more robust manner than a typical canned coffee/capp/frapp drink. TL;DR Good--And I'm not a Coffee Fan!"
Totally what I expected and totally delicious! I shared the box with family and friends and everyone was so surprised that I was able to order these online! TL;DR Yum!
"My spoiled-rotten Chinese Crested is the fussiest eater alive (or perhaps just smarter than Mom & is holding out for people food).  I've had a tough time finding food she likes...but she ADORES Stella & Chewy's.  At first I tried re-hydrating it & she seemed a bit nonplussed, but one day I crumbled it in her dish & gave it to her dry...success!!!  She snarfs it down.  She also loves the freeze dried canine kisses from S&C, so she acts like she's getting a treat every time I feed her.  Love this stuff!!! TL;DR Healthy food for fussy ones!!"
"The McIlhenny's  have done what very few in this space have been able to manage. They have engineered<br />a habanero elixir for the extreme palate that tastes good on just about everything, and I do mean everything.<br /><br />I've got over 50 different brands of hot sauce in my collection and this jewel from Tabasco has pretty much<br />obsoleted all of them. It's got a mild island flavor reminiscent of a jerk/calypso sauce and it's guaranteed<br />to make everything from bar-b-que to hamburgers to collard greens to bloody marys and even salads tastes better.<br />It doesn't have that sting regular Tabasco has that hasn't been properly aged, but it will bite you, and it will<br />bite you hard if you're not judicious with the amount you're pouring on. The best thing about this sauce is that<br />is commercially available just about everywhere. And at this price ($2.40) it makes sense to buy several bottles,<br />cause they don't last long. And unbelievably, my local Publix stocks these 2oz. bottles for $6.99 each! Will rate<br />out at about 8,000 Scoville units, and thats enough for most aspiring pepperheads.<br /><br />Warning - This stuff is addictive. After a couple of weeks on this juice you'll get the ""hot sauce slobbers""<br />every time you walk through your grocery's butcher shop. Don't say I didn't warn you. 5 Scovies! TL;DR Tabasco has a new King!"
"I purchased this tub as a way to try out some new Crystal Light flavors.  I was told I had to cut back on caffeine, and I don't need the calories associated with sugared soft drinks.  These work well, for the most part.<br /><br />My favorite flavor is the raspberry lemonade.  I like the hint of raspberry flavor, and find that I can drink quite a lot of it during the day without getting bored.  I mix up a 32-oz water bottle of the stuff, using 2 packets of mix.  This seems to work well, especially when i down 2-3 bottles of the stuff per day.<br /><br />I also like the lemonade flavor, and the cherry pomegranate.  The strawberry - not so much.  It's their ""energy"" formulation, so it contains some ""extras"" that I think add to a slightly bitter ""sharp"" flavor - and it contains caffeine, which sort of defeats the purpose of my drinking Crystal Light in the first place.<br /><br />I've managed to lose 23 pounds in a little over 3 months using this along with cooking everything from ""scratch"" - no processed foods, lots of fruits and veggies, fresh meats and fish.  I do understand the controversy about aspartame, but given the choice between carrying WAY too much weight and consuming something that may or may not kill me eventually, I'll choose the latter.  Plain water just doesn't do it for me, and this stuff IS tasty. TL;DR Nice assortment of flavors ..."
"I asked my vet before I gave these chews to my Schnauzer.  He said it was o.k. to let her have them.  He said that he had used these chews before for his dog. All three of my dogs love them, I hope they will help some with the tarter. TL;DR C.E.T.  VeggieDent Chews"
"I've ordered these cookies several times and never had any trouble with the packaging as the other reviewer has. More to the point, the cookies are absolutely delicious, and are always quickly devoured after I receive them. TL;DR Delicious cookies"
Dont order listing is wrong NOT SUGAR FREE amazon refuses to correct! already contacted customer service and nothing has been done? TL;DR Not sugar free
"It may seem like a lot of muffin cups to buy at once, but these are absolutely the best ones to use.  Not only are they one small step in saving the environment, but they work better than regular ones.  Muffins come out so much more easily.  I like the look of the little brown boxes.  Some of mine will be used for small gifts for family and friends.  I live in a remote area now and don't have access to stores that carry specialty items like these so I have to buy in quantity from the internet.  I was so happy to find them available at Amazon. TL;DR I love these baking cups"
"So, I get home from work, and either have a choice of eating, waiting two hours, and going swimming or running...<br /><br />...or eating one of these, having a half glass of water, putting my shoes on, and just go exercise.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is great; it's a slightly salty vanilla cake frosting.  Five stars on taste and utility.<br /><br />Four stars because I'm paying more than a dollar for a tablespoon of cake frosting. TL;DR The vanilla flavor is great."
"Trying to save money on an otherwise premium cereal, they ruined the product.<br /><br />As was pointed out above, it's no longer organic. That's not my real concern though. The quality of wheat has clearly decreased. The cereal is somehow more bland, less sweet.<br /><br />It's a real shame. They took something that was loved by many and had hugely popular reviews and decided to skimp on quality, thinking no one would notice.<br /><br />Such a shame. TL;DR They ruined it"
"Tastes like regular bottled water, clean. pH is 9.5, higher than most bottled water (some is acidic).<br /><br />Nice to have in a 1L bottle, which is more like what one needs for hydration, especially in hot weather, instead of smaller bottles.<br /><br />Great to have around the house to keep hydrated.<br /><br />*Note: no measurable minerals for nutrition, yet enough to change the pH.<br /><br />Tastes great (really tasteless, as water should be!)<br /><br />Much like other higher pH bottled waters, yet in a 1L bottle, which seems to encourage water drinking, much like a big plate of food encourages some to over-eat, yet I think most people need to drink more water, so nice to have a big bottle to encourage drinking more water, + the high pH is supposed to be better for you. TL;DR Tastes clean - like regular bottled water, but w/ minerals to increase pH"
"Is Starbucks Italian Roast disappearing?  'can't find it in VIA packs or ground coffee in stores - no VIA packs sold here.  Please don't stop making this coffee available.  It is what it says - Extra Bold - not bitter - and for my two cents ""LOVELY""!! TL;DR Is Starbucks Italian Roast disappearing?"
"I was originally looking for Keurig coffee on Amazon and stumbled across this gem.  I bought it for work to centralize my coffee ""stuff"" and it has been perfect - k-cups, stirrers, sweetener packets, all fit nicely in one place...right below my Keurig!  The only thing that would make this product better would be if the dividers in the drawer were solid so stirrers didn't have a chance to roll around, but since I can tell it was originally designed to only hold k-cups I can't complain.  Great for saving space and looks nicer than the tall, spice rack looking k-cup holders out there - would def recommend. TL;DR Perfect For What I Was Looking For"
"I have a Labrador Retriever who was very excited to try these. She loves them.  This isn't saying much as she pretty much eats anything.  However, I left them on the counter, my teenager accidentally tried one.  He said it wasn't too bad.  He's not willing to switch from human to dog treats but it's nice to know they have been tested on human taste buds and pass.<br /><br />The size of the treats are quite large as is the size of the bag. They don't smell offensive as many dog treats do. They are organic. I don't feel like I'm giving my dog the equivalent of a doggy candy bar.  They are reasonably priced. Great product overall. TL;DR Dog and teenager approved"
"I have purchased the Super Bubble bubblegum in the local Walmart for years.  It is always soft and tasty; the grandkids love it.<br />The bubblegum purchased through Amazon.com is hard, very hard, and taste lasts only a short time.  The grandkids have turned their<br />noses up at it, and I am left trying to chew all this pound bag. TL;DR NOT Super Bubble gum"
Cat hates this as she will not even go near it.  I wish I did not buy 36lbs of this but oh well. TL;DR Cat won't touch it
You won't find any better chocolate for this price. This is by far my favorite chocolate. It's free from unnecessary additives and it just amazingly good. TL;DR Favorite Milk Chocolate
"These are sold at Lowe's in my area and are one of the few treats I will allow my three big dogs. They crumble under these powerful jaws, so I don't worry about choking with them. One of my dogs is diabetic, but these don't seem to effect her blood sugar at all. It feels great to be able to allow her some treats like the other two who aren't restricted. I like the product and the price - good value and quality both! TL;DR My dogs love them!"
"A pleasant surprise came when we tried the diet version of the SodaStream Cream Soda flavor. It has an even better flavor, less like caramel and more like actual cream soda. Also mixes well with the diet flavors of the ""fruit"" variety for a creamsicle taste! TL;DR Better than the non-diet version"
"Have only had this product for a month, but so far am very happy with it.  It appears to be very durable and is fast.  I wish it had a setting for a larger cup but it is fast enough to brew one of their mug settings followed by one cup setting. TL;DR Keurig Coffee brewer"
"This is so good I came on Amazon to find it. I purchased it once at Ralph's and I haven't been able to find it sense..ugh! That's ok, because as usual trusty Amazon has precisely what I'm looking for..YAY! TL;DR So Good!"
"I bought a pack of these recently at an Hmart here in Atlanta, and I could not keep my hands off of them! I bought them with the intention of putting them in some miso soup I was cooking, but they were so delicious by themselves it looks like I'm going to have to make another run to get these again for my soup... The best part is they aren't too bad for you at all, if you don't mind the MSG. TL;DR They must put nicotine in these or something..."
"Can some kind soul who has the can in their possession please type out the info on the Nutrient Label with kindly attention to:<br /><br />Serving size<br />Number of servings per container<br /><br />Calories<br />Fat: Total<br />Fat: Saturated<br />Protein<br />Cholesterol<br /><br />Amazon should require and pre-approve only postings with scanned nutrient labels for all products that the FDA requires such labels for.<br /><br />Thank you much,<br />Eric Furrer<br /><br />BTW: I could only post this ""request review"" if I gave it a star rating.  To be ""fair"", I gave it 5-stars but I have not tried the product yet.  The seller's Amazon posting itself, for not including Nutrient info, deserves less than 5-stars in my opinion. TL;DR Nutrient Content?"
"When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done. Even if I have just fed my girls, if they see us eating they will have a fit. We put some puffs on their walker or high chair trays and they are Happy again. We even pour these in their play pen & they don't even make a mess. At a restaurant if my girls are getting fussy, we'll keep giving them puffs and they are happy. We give them puffs while we are heating their food, if not they'll normally throw fits until we are feeding them.<br /><br />We've tried the Gerber flavors: Bananna, Strawberry/Apple, Apple Cinnamon & my girls love them all. TL;DR ~*~*~My Girls LOVE these, PERFECT SIZE for Little Fingers~*~*~"
These flossies  are absolutely wonderful. Our two Westies get 1/2 of one each day which helps keep their teeth clean. TL;DR Great Product
"this is not a good deal at all. i can go to a local grocery store and get the exact same thing, and the exact same amount it ounces and cans, and only pay 79 dollars. Also dont have to wait for it! TL;DR bad deal"
My Irish Setter eats this treat slowly and it is the perfect fit for her.  My Lab gets the braided stick because he is more aggressive with his treats.  The Setter gets one each evening and is very satisfied with it.  Worth the money I pay for this product TL;DR Bully Sticks
"I first started buying these when they only had three or four flavors. Now they've expanded their flavors and I like the new assortment, especially the blueberry and strawberry flavors. All the flavors are yummy. There isn't one that we don't like. Also, the ingredient list is more specific than it used to be. No corn syrup, which is the main reason I purchase these. I also like that they are organic. Sure, they aren't exactly like ""normal"" lollipops, and they contain sugar, but I'd much rather give my children these than artificially colored and flavored candy. TL;DR Much Improved"
"I ordered this by mistake to begin with.  Then I was punished every time I opened a can to eat.  It is impossible to squeeze the water out of the can as the tuna mush just pushes out and over the lid.  When you add mayonnaise to it, you cannot have a tuna sandwich as you have to eat it with a spoon, it is so soggy.  I guess I will give it to our feral cats to eat and buy some albacore even though it is twice the price. TL;DR Pure mush"
Good flavored coffee at a good price. Getting harder to find in the stores. It has a nice subtle cinnamon flavor. TL;DR Harder to find in stores
"-------------------------------------------------------<br />Illy Issimo Coffee Drink,<br />Cappucino, 8.45-Ounce Can<br />-------------------------------------------------------<br />I'm a fan of Illy coffee, an Italian brand best known for their vacuum-sealed whole beans and ground coffee varieties. I try to keep a can or two around in case civilization breaks down and I either want a little morning jolt before the aliens attack, or if need something to trade with the survivalists and atomic mutants.<br /><br />This aluminum-clad product is a pre-made, sweetened coffee drink not unlike the gooey Starbucks bottles that they sell in convenience stores, though not as syrupy, and maybe with better coffee. I found it pleasant, and refreshing on a hot afternoon. Worth checking out, although the coffee flavor could be more pronounced. Kind of weird that the drink is licensed to (or owned by) Coca-Cola, from Italy, and manufactured in Denmark. But hey, it that's the flavor of globalism, it tastes pretty good! TL;DR Sweetened coffee in a can"
"These vitamuffins are absolutely yummy.  I first bought the already made muffins at the supermarket for $5.00, quantity of 4.  I thought they were delicious but didn't want to spend so much money on just 4 muffins.  Then I found the mix on Amazon and thought it was absolutely worth the money.  You get 12 muffins from each box which is twice as many muffins for about the same price and they're so easy to make, you can't go wrong.  Just be careful when making them though, the box says to put the oven at 400 degrees and bake for 23-27 minutes but the first box I made got burned on the bottom when I listened to those instructions.  The second box I made came out perfect.  I pre-heated the oven at 300 degrees and when I put them in, raised the temperature to 325 degrees and baked for approximately 17-18 minutes, checked them once in between that time.  I don't know if my oven just gets too hot or what but just keep an eye on them.  Other than that, it's a great and healthy snack and if you're on Weight Watchers like I am, for 1 point a muffin, you just can't get anything better than that to satisfy that chocolate craving. TL;DR Yum-O....."
"the creamer is very good, but the packaging was horrible. out of the 200 packs, i was only able to save about 185 of them. need to find a new way to package the product so us consumers aren't wasting our hard earned money. TL;DR good product, BUT....."
"These oysters have been a great buy for us.  At less than $1.00 a can, they are a fantastic deal and they are beautifully smoked.  So far ours have been very small, which we prefer, and our case was packed in sunflower oil instead of cottonseed oil, which is healthier if not heated.  They aren't oily, very smokey, and great with hot sauce, horseradish, and good bacon.  Try some! TL;DR Great Price Great Taste"
"There may not be much inflation in the economy but there has been in the Amazon customer ratings. I can remember when a ""4"" from 10 or more people was close to a lock when it comes to product adequacy. This product's cumulative rating should have meant that Eight O'Clock French Roast would at least be drinkable, but it doesn't and it isn't - drinkable that is.  Really folks, those of you who think this is a GOOD French Roast have been drinking too much Taster's Choice Freeze-Dried (which I would accept a cup of before I would take one of this swill.)<br /><br />I never, NEVER throw food or other consumables out unless it tastes rotten. Half way into the first bag of this stuff I threw it and the other 3 bags in the garbage and sighed in relief. I had gotten rid of the worst rotgut bean coffee I had ever encountered. Really. TL;DR Given a choice between Folger's and Eight O'Clock I'd take the Folger's"
"Oh my! I love this stuff! I am not a good cook and I don't like to experiment with making Gluten Free foods because I waste a lot of time/money on things I end up hating anyways. This is a GOOD buy. When my sister was diagnosed with Celiac, she tried this mix and had me try one of the cheesey bread balls. I was immediately hooked. It was soft, you can refigerate and reheat the leftovers and there are lots of different things you can use this for. Goes great with soups, a variety of suppers and as a treat. At the moment Amazon is fixing the listing or something so they are not selling them at a good price, but when they have them back up, I will definately be ordering more! The pizza crust mix is great too. I was a big fan of self-rising pizzas and that is what the mix is like! soft wonderful pizza crust. I can't reccomend these enough to people! Even ones who don't HAVE to eat GF like me. TL;DR Chebe cheese bread is SOFT and DELICIOUS!"
The Lays Limon chips are the best I have tasted yet.  The Dill Pickle even falls shy to the emmense Lime taste.  Its a fresh and satisfying new combination that will leave you wanting more.  Just as addictive as the Salt and Vinegar chips  but better! TL;DR Zesty and Fresh
"Our veterinarian recommended Blue Buffalo. We have a very itchy corgi mix and was hoping this food would be the answer. We switched from Iams premium protection. He had no stomach troubles with the switch which we did over about a week. He has been on it about five weeks now. At first it seemed to be helping, but I had also started bathing him more frequently. This week I noticed more hair loss than normal and now he has some bald patches and sores in his armpits. I guess we will be switching him back and try to find something new.<br /><br />I don't think that there is anything wrong with the food, but there is something in it that makes our dog's allergies worse and not better. TL;DR Wished it would have worked out"
"I would give his product 4 stars but becase of the price, I'm dropping it to 4. The price of all k-cups over the last year have risen ridiculously in price! But the is a good, bold coffee without tasting like you're licking dirt! TL;DR Great bold flavor"
"We have no complaint about these. We get the 5 lb bag and keep it in the freezer taking out what we need every so often to another container and then resealing. The quality has been consistently good as a subscribe and save item for us. Highly recommend. TL;DR Fine quality, great price."
smells good and tastes good ... wish there are bigger size available to purchase. overall very good products. my roommates loved it as well lol. will buy it again soon. TL;DR excellent
"This was the first time I'd had it, and love it.  Just wish I could find locally. TL;DR Delicious"
"The rating above is for the chocolate itself, not for the taste of the chocolate I got from Amazon. My chocolate arrived as if it had melted and cooled a couple times and was flaky, this gave it a not so smooth texture, although the flavor was still there, I don't like the grainy feeling of melted and then cooled again chocolate that much. So I mostly use it for baking and ground it up to put in cereal and trail mixes.<br /><br />Try not to order this during the summer like I did. Other than that, the chocolate is great. TL;DR Sweet and tangy berry bits in great dark chocolate"
Dr Oz recommended this tea to try with my skin care routine so I have not tasted it.  Dont use to much tea on your skin.  Its powerful. TL;DR Tea
They were very tough and my teenage boys would not eat them.  I ended up giving them to a friend with a young child who had less discerning taste.  Candy is candy at that age. TL;DR Would not recommend
"In the whole of it, these Graham crackers are in fact quite good. The are sweet, and have the 'kick' of the oats in addition to add a unique flavor to them.<br />There's also the fact that they are pretty healthy, with much whole grain, only 110 calories a serving, and an all-natural pretty short ingredient list.<br /><br />But...something about them bugs me at the same time. For something that should be used as a snack, they are almost /too/ filling. Sure one could say ""just eat less"", but two 'sheets' isn't that much in the first place, so while hunger may satiate it just doesn't 'feel' like there's been enough. They are also very dry, even moreso  than most sweet cracker types.<br />There's also the fact that quality control doesn't seem to be the higher -- a couple of the crackers seem a bit burnt.<br /><br />So yeah, they ARE enjoyable, but not really up to snuff. TL;DR Good, but not great. Too filling, and too dry"
"I had high hopes for this product, because it is healthy and affordable.  But neither of my 2 Chihuahuas liked it; one just sniffed at it and walked away; the other dog chewed on it for a short while and then walked away from it.  One dog likes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KUO2XS"">Nylabone Nutri Dent Original Minichews for Mini Dogs, 72-Count Pouch</a>, and the other dog likes <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B3W4N8"">6"" BULLY STICKS - Free Range Standard Regular Thick Select 6 inch (10 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply</a>.  I was looking for some alternatives that were healthy and more affordable.  I guess I'll be sticking with their current treats for now. TL;DR dogs didn't like it"
"I wanted to try something new so I picked this item.  I have not been disapointed in it at all... Just add Honey, Hot water and tea.... Love it 3 glass a day. TL;DR Great Idea to Start with"
"Of all the gluten free foods I have had to eat lately, these are actually really good. I will definitely be buying these again TL;DR Really really good"
"These are tablets of sodium saccharine, 1 grain per tablet. They're much more convenient to use than the powdered saccharine in the pink packets. If you prefer saccharine as your artificial sweetener of choice, this is an easy way to portion it out. TL;DR It's what it says it is."
"These were so delicious that I ate the entire contents of six tins in less than 2 weeks.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, they dissolve very quickly, unlike Spry mints.<br /><br />Although they taste better than Spry lemon-mint flavor, I'm re-ordering only the Spry because I'm just interested in using a few xylitol candies after meals for improved dental health, not losing all control and pigging out night and day. TL;DR too yummy"
I love Swanson Chicken broth.  It is a quality product and I can trust the brand.  I use it in my soups and even to substitute water when I cook rice to give it a little more flavor. TL;DR Its Chicken Broth
"I absolutely love these cookies!  I eat pretty healthy (a lot of fruits, veggies and whole grains) and these are a treat when I eat them.  Just the right amount of chocolate to satisfy the sweet tooth while being healthy at the same time!  I like these and the other Kashi cookies, I think they are called the happy trail mix or something.  Also if you don't eat them right away it does help to put them in a zip lock baggy otherwise they get a bit hard if left open in the box. TL;DR Yummy!"
"Delicious! This is the exact same Tazo Chai Tea concentrate served at Starbucks. This decaf version tastes just like the regular. Make it with an equal amount of skim milk for a fat free treat. Mmmm! No other chai tea comes close in flavor -- it's simply the best. Be sure to refrigerate the carton after opening. I bought it through Amazon from Baker's Box and had no issues. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIYJM"">Tazo Tea Latte Chai Tea Decaf (12x32 OZ)</a> TL;DR Starbucks Chai Tea Latte"
"At the crucial moment of temptation, when I feel I can't resist a Snickers bar any longer, one pack of these is the most satisfying thing in the world. And my 5-year-old son loves them too, which is great, because I can put these packs into his lunch and know he's getting a nutritious ""treat"" instead of sugary empty calories.<br /><br />True, these are not for people who hate Splenda. However, I don't find the amount of Splenda excessive. I find it just right. Most importantly, the almonds are huge and fresh and perfectly roasted. And I love the tiny portable serving sizes. Yes, I can (and have) portioned the almonds out myself into baggies from the canisters. But the pre-made packs stay much fresher and the portion control is a very attractive feature, so I don't mind buying the packs. TL;DR Perfect for low-carb dieters and nutrition-minded moms"
"The product is what I was looking for, the web site described it exactly, the price was right, the purchase was easy, comunications were smooth, and shipping was quick. I am satisfied. TL;DR My Purchase"
"I run a small mobile bakery and I love to please people with my sweets. I was recently asked about gluten-free sweets and this is something I am not familiar with so I did some research and chose this flour. I made blueberry lemon muffins and they were a serious hit! Moist and flavorful, my regular customers bought them and raved about them. TL;DR Awesome Gluten-Free All Purpose Baking Flour"
"This is ridiculous! You are not SAVING $15.00, you are spending at least $5.00 MORE than you should be! The highest price for a 9oz. individual can in my area is $4.49 (I know, yikes!), so 27oz. would cost me around $14.00...why would I want to spend MORE MONEY?!? Thanks for wasting time- I'm obviously not going to find any savings from this company. TL;DR Ridiculous Price!"
This was the best tasting tea I've ever had. It had a rich but mild flavor. Very enjoyable! I highly recommend it! TL;DR Awesome tea!
I love this candy and ate it a lot as a kid. It has been very hard to find in any stores. I am so glad I found it on Amazon. The shipping was fast and the product arrived in excellent condition. It still has the same flavor after all of these years. Try this candy if you love coconut. You will love it too! TL;DR Awesome Candy!!
The amazing cocoa taste is out of this world.  I'm waiting for more to be available to buy!  I hope this is soon available in grocery stores in Connecticut. TL;DR Amazing Granola!!
I use this on my hair to moisturize it and for conditioner. It is good to use on the skin as a moisturizer and for different problems.  It is also good for cooking and eating. I will spread some on a piece of wheat bread when I am hungry and need a quick snack.  In my opinion it is also good for the digestive system. TL;DR let me count the ways I can use the coconut oil
My husband & I love this product.  This was the best place to buy it.  Our walmart stopped carrying it so we had to buy it here. TL;DR Dale's fan
"they are very good is the they i would order again if you like dark choclate you will like these reese TL;DR Reeses Peanut Butter Dark Cups, 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 24)"
"You're better off buying a powder and making your own tea. These tea bags are overpriced, not to mention that ALL of the reviews are bogus, and more than likely from the people working for or related to the manufacturer. Just check their other reviews (if there are any).<br /><br />Chaga is a potent mushroom, but get the real deal and make sure it's organic. TL;DR Overpriced + bogus reviews"
"My older cat just stopped eating the dry kibble food a few months ago. She used to get Fancy Feast as a treat only, but now it is all she will eat. A lot of canned cat food smells repulsive! Fancy Feast actually looks & smells decent. The cat knows which cabinet I keep her food in & she sprints to the kitchen when she hears it open. TL;DR Great for my older cat"
"My brother is a lover of licorice.  Since he was retiring, I decided that a gift of licorice would be unique.  I sent it to him and he raved that, ""It is the best licorice I've ever had."" TL;DR Best licorice in the whole wide world"
"I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with Holiday Spice as a flavor, but it tasted to me like an oatmeal cookie - Delightful! Originally, I received it as a gift in a basket, but came to Amazon to order a whole box. Nice packaging for making little hostess gifts during the holidays. :) TL;DR Delightful surprise!"
"Vegan. Natural. Crisp breads are a very traditional food in Scandinavia. Rye is the most traditional flavor. The rye flavor in this crisp is very mild. Good choice for appetizers or with your favorite soups. Very crisp. For a real treat try with orange or other fruit marmalades for breakfast or anytime treat. Easily resealable in a quart [litre] ziplock bag. Long shelf life. Can last through the long Scandinavian winter until the glorious spring. Made in Espoo, Finland. Approximately 33 crisps per box. Only 20 calories per crisp. Also really like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JJM4RY"">Finn Crisp Sesame Rounds, 8.8-Ounce Units  (Pack of 12)</a>. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you. TL;DR Vegan Natural Choice"
"I've purchased organic powdered sugar before so I have something to compare Wholesome Sweeteners organic powdered sugar to.  This stuff is kind of clumpy.  It reminds me of plaster of paris.  I used it to sprinkle sugar on top of cookies and I had to sift it first, but there was still some clumps in the sifter.<br /> I also used it to make icing and that came out without clumps.  So, the sugars ok, but it's got to be sifted if you don't plan on mixing it with any liquids. TL;DR feels like plaster"
"I was excited about this flavor, but the tea did not come in a resealable pouch. It came in a regular brown bag. Though it smells divine, it is definitely old and stale. The taste is unpleasant even though I have played around with water temperatures and brewing times. Very disappointing and a waste of money; I will have to throw it away. DO NOT BUY! TL;DR Stale Tea, Improperly Packaged"
"The last two times I bought this variety (at a local BJ's, not through Amazon), rather than chunks, the cans contained what I would call shredded tuna (if it IS all tuna!). I couldn't even drain the cans by pressing on the top, as I usually used to do - the semi-solid stuff inside kept running out along with the liquid it was packed in! When I resorted to pouring it in a strainer, the water STILL didn't drain - it was just one big mushy blob. I finally Googled ""Bumblebee chunk white albacore tuna"" and found out that a LOT of people had the same types of complaints. Yeah - I know - I should have learned after the FIRST time I got it at BJ's - but I try to give folks the benefit of the doubt. However, after this, I will never again buy this stuff, and urge others not to waste their money on it either! TL;DR Bumblebee chunk white albacore is DISGUSTING!"
"Well made, a nice way of keeping my kosher salt handy without it being open to the elements.  All in all I'm very happy with it.  That being said I will list my gripes:<br />1. I agree with the other reviewer...the top attracts a lot of dust and grime...I just make a point to wipe the silicone down with a sponge more often.<br />2.  The whole point of having a salt pig is the ability to grab a pinch of salt when you need it.  I had read reviews of men complaining the opening was too small...well I'm not a man I thought I was okay...I can BARELY get my fingers in there but it's not very easy and making the opening just a hair bigger would solve the issue.<br /><br />All in all I love it anyway!  Especially the spoon in the back. TL;DR Great...not perfect"
"Honestly, I should stop my automatic one-stop-easy-shop addiction shopping at Amazon.  This is just another example of purchasing at Amazon a product that, after the fact, I find in several other places for a much lower price.  In fact, Amazon's ""sale"" of 2 boxes for $[...], is more than the regular price at several other stores.  Additionally, the packages came with big stickers ""Ready for shipment,"" on them which were not easy to peel off (makes for tacky looking gifts).  Search elsewhere.  You'll find you'll save money.<br /><br />These are tasty, however.  We've had them before and enjoyed them. TL;DR Good chocolate, but price scam"
These are excellent and healthy training high value treats.  My dogs love them.  They are good to handle after hydrating.  I like they come in various versions. TL;DR Excellent Treat
"This is a great product *and* if you do a cost analysis of the 10 pack combo to this 21oz one, then you will see that you are getting hundreds of percents back in profit by, buying this over the individual packs. Trust me, I did calculations before attempting to buy food over the internet O.o<br /><br />By the way...... This is my second purchase of this product. I waited until the first bottle was empty before writing a review. TL;DR the guy who gave this product 1 star is an as~s h~ole."
I have been buying this at the grocery since they started making it and love it! I'm a diabetic and have to watch my sugars. When i want something sweet this makes a great low carb sweet snack! This price was almost shocking it was so low! I was paying $6.00 a can IF i could find it. Now i have enough for the rest of my life and i'm a happy camper!! Thank you Amazon for your wonderful offerings and prices!! TL;DR Swiss Miss no sugar added cocoa
"I received my first shipment of a monthly subscription order of the Whole Grain Hot Cereal.  These are absolutely wonderful!  When cooked, they have the consistency of grits, and well, they are! Whole grain grits (cereal)!  The cooking instructions call for salt to taste, but I also suggest a bit of butter or margarine.  Maybe some fresh fruit slices and you got a yummy breakfast!<br /><br />HIGHLY Recommended!  I'm keeping my monthly subscription for sure! TL;DR Good and Good For You!"
"This product is okay tasting, not great, but okay. If you are on a gluten free diet, it works, but I wouldn't purchase again, it's just too corny tasting and a tad granular. It should be labeled 'Corn pasta with Quinoa' and not Quinoa pasta. TL;DR This is made primarily with corn flour."
Product was older then I would purchase if I knew what the date on the individual boxes was before purchase. It gives me only one month to eat them all before being outdated. TL;DR cracker jack
"I just opened a can of this hummus, and I really hope it's just bad-tasting, and not actually *bad* (spoiled).  It was a bit acidic, and just tasted bad.  I would never buy it again. TL;DR Bad or ""bad""?"
"Tazo tea is my favorite, although Passion is not my favorite variety.  I ordered several different boxes and flavors, and all were great.  The price was right, and shipping was fast. TL;DR Great Tea"
"This was the best deal ever. The delivery was fast, the chips are delicious and very fresh.  Love it:) TL;DR Best deal ever!"
"Don't bother buying this here, it is WAY overpriced.  Stop by Wal-Mart and pay a bit over half what these people are selling the stuff for.<br /><br />Anyway, we have now tried all the flavors.  Like any other flavor, some we like better than others as it is a matter of personal preference... but all of them were good.  We really like all but the Fruit Punch and will cycle through all the other remaining flavors again and again.<br /><br />Kraft Foods are not claiming they have invented a new major food group here, it is water flavoring.  They came through with that just fine.  Unscrew the cap, squirt into the bottle, replace the cap and shake.  Can't get any easier than that.  Using tap water is fine too.<br /><br />As for the guy whining about ""chemicals"", everything we eat contains ""chemicals"".  Get over it. TL;DR Great tasting flavoring."
"i had loved and bought this product for years and then i couldn't find it anymore.  it was SO GREAT to be able to order the coffee through amazon.  if you get the whole beans, they are perfect, not burned like some, and it tastes fresh and good. the ground coffee is equally special.  the order arrived the next day, great packaging, a nice note, so efficient.  i am happy to support a smaller company instead of one of the big corporations.  i feel so lucky! TL;DR best coffee ever"
"This is the only cold cereal I've found that doesn't make my blood sugar spike.  It's low in carbs and has lots of fiber.  And I really like the taste.  It's just sweet enough, and somewhat nutty-tasting.  If you're accustomed to cereals with added sugar, you might find it bland, but I love it. TL;DR I like it very much"
"I bought two jars and they were so good, that I am going to order at least two more especially now that football season has started. TL;DR Excellent"
"This gum was recommended to us by our dentist.  He said that xylitol was supposed to be very good for teeth.  The gum tastes great and does seem to be helping our families' teeth.  This 4 pack is the best deal price-wise.  Since we have a large family (8 kids), we tend to go through it quickly.  The variety pack is nice, too, since everyone likes a different flavor!  The least-liked flavor is the fruit.  It would be nice if the buyer could just pick 4 of his/her favorite flavors, but until that happens, we'll continue to buy this. TL;DR Spry Xylitol Gum"
"First had these in LA.  No grocery store in my area sells them.  Odd because Providence, RI is not a remote town.  Anyway, I was glad to find them on Amazon. TL;DR Sweet treats"
"Any bad review on these is a personal problem of that person.<br />The only complaint I get on these is from my dogs, who can't get enough.<br />PS>if you don't like them, great.  All the more for those of us that do.<br /><br />Update.  Had to put my big black lab down due to cancer.  Left rear was<br />taken years ago and left front went with bone eating cancer, so it was<br />his time, and a sad day.  That was 11 months ago, but life goes on.<br />As for these crackers, there still a hit at work.  Four crackers, sometimes<br />broken but still work, plenty of cheese, sometimes you get 2 little sticks,<br />sometimes you get none, but hey, I even got one with 5 crackers once, so<br />always a supprise.<br />Enjoy. TL;DR perfect at work"
"This formula along with a whole bunch of other ""Organic"" formulas are made by PBM [...]<br />They recently changed their formulation, and have not changed the packaging, so you must watch your cans carefully for the ingredients change. My baby knew the formula was different and refused the new cans, got really gassy too.<br />I've called PBM Organics twice, first time they denied the change of formula. Second time they admitted it.<br /><br />The cans do not say anything like new formula or give you any indication of this. Whey is no longer the first ingredient, and Corn syrup solids is very high on the list.<br /><br />Very shady practices by PBM. Beware. TL;DR Formula has changed for worse"
"If you like granola and dark chocolate, you'll love this.  It doesn't say on the package if it's a cereal or snack.  I just ate it as a snack.  When I received and opened it I noticed something else in the bag.  I just assumed it was a coupon or pamphlet about the product.  I ignored it and left it in there.  After a couple of days and several handfuls I pulled it out.  To my dismay it was the top part of the bag from another package!  It looks like someone ripped open a package of back to Nature and just threw their trash into this one.  Q.C. at this plant is obviously needed!<br />Good taste, but what else will you find in your bag? TL;DR Cereal?"
I love this soup but why is it so expensive at Amazon? I can get it so much cheaper at my local grocery store. TL;DR My favorite soup
I am someone who enjoys a very occassional glass of wine but not brandy or other liquors very much. This chocolate was a true delight to the senses! The dark chocolate has a slight unsweet/bitter flavor with the alcohol being sweet sends the senses dashing with pleasure. It is smooth. I enjoy a small bite of the end of the chocolate piece an slowly sip the brandy and continue to nibble the dark chocolate. The after taste is lasting with a pleasant flavor. I would recommend this product to friends and family. TL;DR Outstanding delight
I bought this for my mother who could no longer find it. Tea is of course a matter of personal taste but on this topic I can agree with her. This tea deserves its fine reputation. Thank you Amazon for making it available. Service from seller was just as impressive as the tea itself. TL;DR Hard to find but well worth the search
"Sent this gift as a surprise to my brother, who didn't like the Christmas gift I gave him. So I came home found this and sent it to him. Made him think twice about being rude. TL;DR Surprise Gift"
"This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING! TL;DR Marley's Mellow Mood Lite - Half Tea Half Lemonade"
i try a lot of different energy bar and breakfast bar things and strive to find healthy ones that also taste good. these go raw spirulina things taste awful. i tried to eat one while on a bike ride and after a bite or two had to spit it out. i even stuck my fingers in my mouth and wiped off my tongue. i can only think that when these go to sleep at night they dream of being an oatmeal raisin cliff bar.<br /><br />whoever created these things hates people or has a cardboard tongue.  i have a pretty forgiving palette. i eat everything but i couldn't get these down. it literally made me gag.<br /><br />be warned.. these are terrible unless you have no taste buds.<br /><br />sorry Go Raw.... but that's my experience. TL;DR these taste terrible
"Pretty good as far as these things go, but I don't know, all the Tassimo milks have a kind of funny taste to me. TL;DR Not bad"
I ordered this because I was looking for something to replace Millstone Foglifter after the price got so outrageous.  Wile not quit as rich it fit the bill will reorder TL;DR Was pleased
"Very satisfied with this product. Addition times are listed beside each ingredient, which makes this recipe easy to follow if you are already familiar with the basics of extract brewing. TL;DR Fast Shipping/Quality Ingredients"
"This is the best Thai brown Jasmine rice either my wife, who is Thai, or myself, who lived in Thailand for three years, have ever eaten. This includes our time in Thailand. TL;DR Superb taste and healthy"
"I'm hooked on CLICK Espresso Protein drink, Mocha.  I actually drink it every morning on my way to work. Experiment with it by adding more protein, extracts, flavored syrups amd it's great in the blender with ice. TL;DR A Great Tasting Protein Drink For Coffee Lovers"
"Even though it is a 8 oz package, there are actually lots of casing. you can use arround 50lb of meat on it. the quality is pretty good also. great buy! TL;DR lots of casing for cheap"
This was a favorite for the kittens and mom liked it too. We were very happy that this was offered for our kittens. TL;DR Good stuff
"Being prediabetic, I don't eat a lot of ""store-boought"" cookies, but I usually taste cookies that my husband buys.  I am quite fond of the regular Chips Ahoy cookies and think they are great to use to make ice cream sandwiches.  Being a former chocoholic, I was eager to try these new Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies.  They did not disappoint!  The reason that I gave them only 4 stars is that they don't come close to tasting like a homemade cookie, which is my ""gold standard.""  My husband, who likes regular Chips Ahoy cookies, was not a big fan of the Chewy Gooey Megafudge variety.  His veiw is ""why mess with a good product?""  I believe that this flavor cookie is a nice addition to the Chips Ahoy family.  I wouldn't want to give up regular Chips Ahaoy cookies, but if you like chocolate,  you'll probably like the new flavor! TL;DR good cookies"
I DID NOT LIKE IT. IT MADE ME COUGH EVERY DRINK OF IT & DID NOT TASTE GOOD I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY ABOUT IT... TL;DR too fizzy
"These take a bit of work; rise them off, then boil for a bit, then try to dry them off, then fry them till squeeky, then add them to your item you're making.  Good luck trying to cut them.  They have no taste so works well in stir fry, or soup, or even spagetti sauce.  I am used to dry noodles; these are slippery and wet when you take them out of the package.  I'm not impressed. TL;DR miracle noodle - angel hair shape"
"As soon as this tea arrived, I had to try a cup. The scent of jasmin  filled the air upon opening. The taste was just as delightful - pleasant, light, and relaxing.  I have enjoyed several cups on a chilly evening just before bedtime, but also in evening after returning from a stressful day at the office.  I would recommend this tea to those that enjoy a unique cup of tea, not the standard bag in a box. TL;DR Delightful scent"
These seaweed snacks taste a little fishy at first but get better as you eat a number of them.  A serving of 10 is only 30 calories but is somewhat filling.  A good source of vitamin A.  Not bad bang for the buck. TL;DR Grow's on you
"I used this product for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. I prefer the vanilla flavors of all the rice beverage milk replacers. It's sweet, if you like that.<br /><br />However, Rice Dream now uses the cheaper canola oil in all their rice milk products (except a few items, like the Healthwise rice beverages). Canola oil contains erucic acid, a toxic chemical. The FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and do not allow it in infant formula. In addition, studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />The Healthwise Rice Dream rice beverage is much healthier, it has half the sugar, no canola oil, and plant sterols (which may reduce serum cholesterol). Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink, it tastes more like fresh whole milk straight out of the cow (if you have had that) than what is sold in cartons in the US. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free.<br /><br />The same canola issue (as well as added table sugar in some products) also applies to the Imagine frozen desert products.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications. Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants. Check out this small sample of government and peer-reviewed medical journal articles documenting my statements, available online.<br /><br />United States Legislation on Low Erucic Acid Rapeseed Oil, Federal Department of Agriculture, 1985, article 184.1555, sections 3 and 4.<br />Growth Rate, Lipid Composition, Metabolism and Myocardial Lesions of Rats Fed Rapeseed Oils J.

I ordered Walden Farms for a friend of mine that couldn't find it in the stores of the UK. SHe loves it. I purchased the Honey Dijon and am equally satisfied. TL;DR SATISFIED CUSTOMER
I was so happy to find this tea.  It is our favorite and the price is better than anywhere!  We have completely quit drinking soda- this is cheaper and healthier! TL;DR Great!
"I've used this in a variety of New England-style seafood soups and chowders and it can't be beat. Making my own fresh stock from lobster shells and fish heads requires both time and ingredients hard to come by in West Virginia, and every other stock I've tried is overwhelmed by salt with a bland, watery faux-fish flavor. TL;DR worth every penny"
"These crackers are 100% natural, contain no artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors and they are hydrogenated oil free.  The flavor is mild and crunchy.<br /><br />The crackers are made with unbleached wheat flour and whole grain wheat flour.  These crackers are so mild in flavor and they won't take away from dips or other toppings.  They are very fresh and crunchy!<br /><br />The crackers also contain safflower oil, sunflower seeds, whole grain rolled oats, evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, sea salt, basil, parsley, black pepper, malted barley extract, baking soda, onion powder, garlic powder, soy lecithin, vitamin E, and soy.<br /><br />The box contains 6 servings (17 crackers).  Each serving is 140 cal., 5 g fat, 1.5 g polyunsaturated fat, 3 g monounsaturated fat, 220 mg sodium, 75 mg potassium, 20 g carbs, 1 g fiber, 2 g sugar, and 3 g protein.<br /><br />The crackers are made by Back to Nature Foods located in Madison, WI.  Made in the USA!  I give these crackers 3/5 for flavor, 5/5 for texture, and 5/5 for maintaining Earth conscious care.<br /><br />The carton is made of 100% recycled paperboard and the ink is derived from vegetables.  The company also supports the Nature Conservancy (Protecting nature, preserving life). TL;DR Back to Nature 100% Natural Sunflower Basil Crackers 6.5 oz."
"i love love love this drink mix! i use to live by a coffee shack that use this for their chi tea, but i moved away and none of the coffee shops in my area have a a drink that comes close in flavor (sooooo bland).<br />a to top it off this mix is super easy to make and can be use for more than just hot/cold drinks. TL;DR soooooo good!"
"As always, fast delivery from Amazon. This is a very good tasting flavored decaf coffee. Dark and rich in looks and aroma. Good taste but rather ""light"" in the flavor which I suppose is what many desire.  I was expecting a bit stronger flavor after enjoying the aroma.  Unlike some flavored coffees I've tried, this provides a good tasting cup of coffee but does have a bit of an aftertaste in my opinion.<br /><br />If you are looking for a coffee with a light flavor, you'll love this. TL;DR Nice Flavored Coffee"
"Buying pet food can and is a tricky proposition.  This review is about dog food, Purina One, Smartblend, to be specific.  You can spend hours; no, days actually, researching various dog foods on line and via various publications.  Name a brand and you will find many who will defend it right down to the matt.  On the other hand, the same brand will have its distracters; folks who absolutely hate the stuff.  If you care about your dog (and you really should not have a dog if you don't care about it or them), then you need to do your research and do what you feel is best for your animal.  Now let me make one statement before I write the review...it is a rather important statement:<br /><br />If you dog gets sick on any given dog food, then for goodness sakes throw the stuff out, stop feeding your dog that food, and try something different!<br /><br />We have, at this time, four dogs.  They range from 9 pounds to 35 pounds and from two years old to 14 years old.  My wife and I have had dogs all of our lives; cats too, but we are primarily dog people.  We have been using Purina products for years and have been quite happy with the results.  We have healthy dogs and we go to great lengths to keep them that way.<br /><br />At present, and for the past four or five years, we have been using Purina ONE, Smartblend - Lamb & Rice Formula.  We have had great results with it.  There has been no weigh loss nor any weight gains - as long as we keep them on this stuff.  The only problems we do have is that our dogs absolutely LOVE people food and they are garbage guts when it comes to finding delicious ""things"" in the yard and in the woods.  People food and ""things"" usually bring on a case of diarrhea or in some cases, vomiting.  We take care that this does not happen but quite often we find the dogs are much smarter than we are and they are all four most certainly skilled beggars.<br /><br />Purina, as far as I can find, is manufactured here in the U.S.  Yes, they are owned by the Swiss company Nestle, but it would seem that the food is made here in the U.S.  Someone correct me if I am wrong please.<br /><br />If you compare the stuff in this food with that of other brands, it stacks up quite well.  All of our dogs prefer this food over other brands we have tried from time to time (more about that later), of course it must be remembered that all four are quite happy with four day old road killed possum - if they can get it.  The lamb seems to have a more soothing effect on them and they do not seem to have the problems digesting it as they do other meat additives.  Now don't get me wrong, they would prefer that we served them baked chicken (their absolute most favored food on earth) each day, but that ain't a going to happen!<br /><br />It should be noted that any time you change dog food brands or dog food mixes, you are going to have some digestive problems with your dogs.  It will almost always cause diarrhea or loose stools.  If you must change brands or contents, do it slowly, mixing the new brand with the old gradually over several days.  This is a pain, but it is worth it.<br /><br />We buy this stuff in the 18 pound bags here locally and the price is a bit higher, per pound, than we find here on Amazon...although that varies from month to month. If you have Amazon Prime then the shipping is not a factor to fret about.<br /><br />Overall, we are happy with this food and will be unless we learn differently or if our dogs start doing poorly. There are other dog foods of equal quality out there and the challenge is to find one that suits your particular dog's needs. This stuff does the job for us.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks TL;DR THIS STUFF WORKS FOR US AND OUR DOGS LOVE IT - PERHAPS IT WILL WORK FOR YOU AND YOURS."
Other than frying this oil has many uses my favorite use is making Italian dressing. This is a Super Food why are we not growing this amazing plant in the US? [...] TL;DR Super
"I'm not really writing about the product here as the product is great.  However when I purchased it, I had no idea what I was getting.  The picture is too confusing and I never got to pick another color even though there was a myriad (in the picture) to choose from.  However, I find nothing wrong with product except that occasionally my kitten can turn it over. TL;DR Does what it needs to do"
"These cashews are excellent and have just enough salt. In general, most prepared foods have too much salt. Most Americans exceed their daily salt intake by two or three times the FDA suggested intake. Finally you have a lower sodium dry roasted nut that is fresh, roasted to perfection and reasonably priced. If you want more salt, lightly coat the nuts with some olive oil and break out your salt shaker. TL;DR Roasted and salted to perfection"
"Splendid product.  Delivered as advertised, on time.  If you like green tea, you'll like this one. TL;DR Green Tea"
"We have used this product for years as a creamer for our morning coffee.  One rounded teaspoon in a large cup of black coffee gives it a smooth, slightly sweet taste.  Occasionally, I follow the directions for a cup of evening dessert cappuccino. TL;DR Best mix on the market!"
"I've been using <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG"">MIO</a> in my water for quite a while now. I like that it allows me to give my water that something extra, so that it makes me more inclined to get my daily intake of water in. Additionally being able to choose how much or how little flavor you add is nice too; me I found that with most of the flavors I like 2-3 quick squirts in my water bottle which holds 24 ounces. Mango Peach is by far my favorite, with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY"">MIO Sweet Tea</a> as a close second. For some the taste may be unappetizing and I admit at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but it grew on me and now I use MIO on an almost daily basis. TL;DR A little flavor or a lot, the choice is mine"
taste better than juicy juice. not as strong flavored. carbonation is nice. my new fav real juice. wish i had them locally. oh well. TL;DR Great
Nice product. I got it for my mother on her birthday. She loved it. These are her favorite cookies. She couldnt of been happier with anything else. Im glad i seen these on amazon!! Awesome awesome i give it a A+ on shipping and the cookies. Thank you very much!! TL;DR Fast shipping!!
"First of all, superb!  I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I can honestly say that this blend is some of the best that I've had in a very long while.  And, although, I'm NOT an avid coffee drinker, I'd recommend this blend to individuals who aren't familiar with non-commercially, monopolizing brands.  This gives Folgers a run for its money and, quite frankly, ****'s all over Community. Lastly, I'd buy this blend again and again, if only to satiate the cravings that I get from it, that no other blends could provide. Thanks Kilambe!! TL;DR Splenderific"
"I purchased 5# of this coffee a while back, broke the bag down, vacuum packed it and froze...  I take out what I need for espresso and regular coffee.<br /><br />The taste is VERY smooth - I regularly drink Blue Mountain, and I compare this in smoothness to that.  The best part is the high caffeine kick - I usually drink 4 shots of espresso in a nice latte first thing in the morning, but with this stuff - I only need two shots and I'm in orbit for the rest of the day...<br /><br />It doesn't give you a crazy caffeine buzz either - just a nice awake feeling...  Worth every penny and I recommend it to my friends all the time.<br /><br />As soon as I run out, I'm buying more... TL;DR This stuff rocks!"
"A good balance, very tasty, the only k-cup we buy on a regular basis. The other coffee people flavors are usually pretty good as well, but the tree hugger is our favorite by far. TL;DR our favorite k cup"
"I sometimes use these on days where I haven't had much sleep or where I'm doing a ton of work. It does work, but it's not a clobber you over the head type energy that you get with an XXL Starbucks with 2 extra shots or Red Bull. The taste is a very bitter lemon, not the best, but tolerable for a bit of pep. TL;DR Nice boost for the afternoon"
"These peppercorn are great.  We keep some in a grinder on the dining room table and then we run about 1/2 the bag through our Vitamix (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004F9L4EI"">Vitamix 5200c - 7 YR WARRANTY Variable Speed Countertop Blender with 2+ HP Motor and 48-Ounce Jar</a>) to have pre-ground pepper for cooking with.<br /><br />This is our 2nd purchase in the past year.  MUCH better than buying ground pepper at the grocery store. TL;DR Great peppercorn!"
"These are alright, very sticky and chewy, a bit sour, way too sweet. My 9 year old guy is a candy junky, to the horror of his mother, but even with the awful sweetness of these things, he only ate the sour apple...said the other flavors sucked.<br />If you're into paying a ton of money for sugar with a bit of fruit and tons of plastic packaging, both these and Stretch Island fruit leathers would fit your needs. Although, Stretch Island has more fruity flavor without the sickening sweetness. TL;DR My 9 year old only ate 1 flavor!"
"I eat all kinds of beans as they are a main source of my protein intake. These rank up there as one of my top three favorite. Fast and easy to make and they taste terrific. I like to cook these in vegetable stock, really gives it extra depth to the flavor. TL;DR Best Beans Ever!!!"
"Everyone really Loved this in their coffee - Many thought I purchased it from overseas! TL;DR Best Flavoring Syrup on the market - It really made Christmas special this year as everyone repeated ""Now That's Good Coffee"""
"I recently discovered that I have sensitivities to dairy and wheat, so I have been trying gluten free products.  I knew about Hodgson Mill because of their Oat Bran hot cereal, which is really good and soothes my tummy.  Consequently, I ordered Hodgson Mill gluten free pancake and waffle mix, as well as their apple cinnamon muffin mix.  Both have proven delicious.  Even my husband, who is not gluten sensitive, loves the pancakes.  I made waffles from the apple cinnamon mix this morning, and they were really good and very filling.  Not sure if the formulation has changed since the previous negative reviews, but I have no complaints, and I am very picky.  I just wish Hodgson Mill products were more readily available in our local stores.  If anyone has tried their gluten-free pasta, please post because Lundberg's rice pasta left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Thanks! TL;DR YUMMY!!!"
It's like eating whey Grass with carbonation.  NOT RECOMMENDED! I couldn't get through more than 2 sips. GROSS! TL;DR BLECHT
"If your dog is a heavy chewer these are obviously tasty but not nearly as hard as bully sticks.  If you want to give your dog a ""project"" while you are away from home I suggest you don't expect this product to substitute for the more expensive, heavy duty bully sticks.  I keep these and the bully sticks in my freezer.  The frozen bully stick keeps my labrador busy for a few hours.  These treats are gone before my car has left the driveway.  For the reviews that say this product is smelly, keeping it in the freezer in a freezer baggie solves that problem. TL;DR My dog loves these but...."
"I have been a big fan of Ramune for years. This is a lower-sugar, less-in-a-bottle drink that is good for anyone on a diet or just wants to lessen their sugar intake. Popping open the bottle is also pretty fun for anyone. Don't be worried about the marble, there are more kids who choke on pop tabs than get hurt from the marble each year (in fact, I have yet to find a report about anyone being hurt by the marble).<br /><br />The only problem I can see with buying this product here is the price. I went to my local (1 hour drive away) Asian grocery and bought this product for a mere $8. Yes, a 6-pack for $8. The price online is NO BARGAIN. I would suggest looking elsewhere if you would like to try this delicious treat. TL;DR Taste vs. Price"
Didn't have the flavor i was accustomed too. Not sure if I'll buy again TL;DR Not up to par
"The O.N.E. Coconut Water is absolutely outstanding, but this vendor's price is not.  You can get a 1 liter container at Cost Plus/World Market for $4.49 each, which is $53.99 for 12. TL;DR You Can Get It Cheaper...."
"All by itself, I would have to give this a 3.  But, as I've learned with most packaged food, it can be easily made into a 5.  I prepare as described on the box and top with mixed Italian herbs, crushed red pepper, and a pinch of shredded Parmesan.  Not only does it look more appetizing, but it tastes great!  And these are things I usually keep around the house, so I just grabbed whatever I had and it only adds about 30 seconds to the prep process.  I highly recommend if you're willing to add things you like to flavor it up. TL;DR Add your own flavor to make it a 5"
"I agree with the other reviewer -- best jelly beans ever. Flavor throughout the bean, soft, melts in your mouth. Difficult to stop eating. Definitely stock up around Easter -- local Stop & Shop had 2 bags for $1. TL;DR The Best"
"This is an excellent source of protein. It is one of the better tasting protein drinks on the market. I have tried many, but this one is the best to me. I drink mine warm just like I'm having coffee. I drink one every morning, then I'll have one in the early afternoon for a pick me up.  I would suggest this product for anyone who needs protein and hate the way most protein drinks taste. I use a shaker to mix the product with milk. Mmm, yummy TL;DR Click"
I love spicy food but these are crazy spicy.  Definitely take another reviewer's advice and only add 1/2 the spice packet.  I didn't because I do love spicy food and they were really too hot for me.  I poured off the broth and was able to enjoy them but next time I will reduce the amount of the spice packet.  Otherwise really good ramen and not a flavor you would easily find in stores. TL;DR Good but YOW SPICY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Black beans are pretty versatile; they can be used hot or cold in various dishes. These beans are firm not squishy nor<br />overpoweringly flavored. For less than 15 bucks a 12 pack they're a decent deal. I didn't give them 5 stars due to the discrepancy between posted and actual nutritional details.<br /><br />This information is very important to some customers. To reduce the salt somewhat be sure to rinse the beans in cold water and drain them. This also helps cut heartburn...sorry I don't have any suggestions for reducing the ""tooters"" though. TL;DR Firm, Tasty, Hot or Cold"
I really do not like to review Coffee because it's a matter of personal taste. But I thought why not. I have been using this brand for a few months and I must say that I love the coffee. Any one that drinks this coffe loves the product as well. I brew my coffee twice on my Keurig. I brew a large cup then brew a small cup with the same cup. Still very bold and nice. I would recommend this but then again it's the matter of personal taste. TL;DR I Love it
"This product is great.  It's primary ingredient is dates and you can't even tell.  When it's blended with the spices and nuts, it takes on the flavor. TL;DR Great tasting snack or part of your meal plan."
"I was skeptical but it worked very well!  I am still nursing my 16 month old a few times a day, but after a weeklong vacation where he didn't nurse much (due to distraction) my supply was very low.  He would nurse for 45 mins and only get one letdown. After drinking a few cups of tea I noticed a huge difference.  Now he gets plenty of letdowns and milk in between :). I'm so glad this worked because he is obviously not ready to wean yet! TL;DR It works!"
"This basket was a gift.  And although the product in the basket was delicious, the basket was small and the amount of the goodies were teeny tiny.  Next time I'll make my own basket. TL;DR Nice but small"
"My dog Loves these ""dogswell happy hipps"" treats. Buy the duck ..he goes insane for them. You have no idea how hpayy your dog will be!! And it great for them.he is 2 yr old german shephard k9,@ a member of my family. So only the best for him......dogswell duck!!!  Thank u, great job TL;DR wow!"
"It is so hard to get him to eat anything organic or healthy, but he loves these! TL;DR Hubby loves them"
"My 5 lb yorkie isn't crazy about these treats.  He kicks them around like a toy, but never seems to eat them.  I've had better luck with fresh carrots, which he loves & are cheaper too! TL;DR Dog isn't crazy about these"
"I was using this product and loved it. They just sent me the new and improved and I thought I had soap in my coffee cup. Washed it out and found out it was the new flavor. It taste more like butterscotch or carmel. It gives you an after taste. Not impressed, canceled my other orders. Amazon it still the place to shop, there shipping is great etc. TL;DR New and improved!  NOT!!!"
These may have saved my wife's life in the first two weeks after she found out she had Celiac's Disease. They are great by any standard. Came all the way to Florida and were still fresh-tasting and moist. I only got a couple of bites -- my wife hoarded the rest. Any cookie afficiaonado would love these. TL;DR Great cookies even if they weren't G-Free
"I have a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JLNBW4"">Koolatron KWC-4 Coca-Cola Personal 6-Can Mini Fridge</a> at work and bring these to work to eat. I like my tuna and peaches cold, always have for some reason. I have one in the mini fridge, for when I get in my office in the morning; and bring an extra to put in for tomorrow. I love these along with a small juice pouch.<br /><br />I like the whole set: the tuna salad in the can with an easy open lid, the sweet juicy peaches, crackers for the tuna, and a cookie to top it off with. Yum! They go great with juice. This kit helps me avoid the community fridge, so I don't have to worry about the sorry excuse ""I thought this was anybodys food in this fridge"" when my tuna ends up missing.<br /><br />Luckily enough, I can shove the kit and pouch in the tiny Coke fridge of mine. For the price of this kit it's awesome! Plus it keeps me from the community fridge, it pays for itself right there!<br /><br />Yeah, this tuna deserves 5 stars! For the price and convienence, it's a steal. All the food is very good and full on flavor. I recommend this to anyone who loves tuna. Unfortunately Amazon no longer ships these 8 packs. I wish they would, cause it's a great combo.<br /><br />I also have a comment about one user complaining about it coming with some peaches; is it really that hard to toss those away? Plus, deduct 2 stars from a 5 star product just beause it gave extra accessories? I mean really, come on. TL;DR Very good, compact, and tasty"
Doesn't give you the jitters and doesn't tast bad either.  Prefer this over the sweet drinks that you have to drink over 8 oz TL;DR Energy for more than five hours :-)
"my husband and i were dining last night at a local sushi bar and the waiter gave us these candies after our meal.  if you love the taste of coffee, you will love these little candies.  i kept the wrapper and went online today in search of where to buy them! TL;DR awesome after-meal treat!"
"StumbleUpon users, be wary. I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.<br /><br />Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.<br /><br />After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.<br /><br />The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isn't the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, it's much more subtle than you'd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I don't think it's worth the money. TL;DR Nothing Miraculous Here"
"I really the original Vita Coco, without any other flavors added. My last shipment was wrong! I received the one with Pineapple added to it which I have tried and do not like. It seems that when Amazon runs out of a product they just send you whatever they have available. This is second time I get the wrong item and the second time I've had cancel a subscription. I don't think this review will make it to the public as the last one I wrote was not posted because Amazon doesn't want any negative reviews about them! Hopefully, someone will contact me in order to correct this issue @ yaninatz@yahoo.com as I have emailed them regarding this problem. TL;DR Received the wrong item!! Again!!"
coupon in the package  expired 6/30/11  so I am wondoring how old the product is? I received my order 9/30/11 TL;DR How old is my soup?
"We decided to try this Zamouri Ethiopian spice mixture and we discovered that it is absolutely delicious in meat stews and soups! It has just a very slight hint of heat, perfect for almost any meat stew. TL;DR Great seasoning for soup or stew!"
"Thank god somebody came out with a non-soy protein powder alternative! Soy is added to almost every food product out there and it's NOT GOOD FOR OUR BODIES!!<br />Some people may not like the slight ""pea"" aftertaste or graininess, but what powder isn't grainy? Anyway, all the ingredients in this product are healthy alternatives to other products out there. The natural flavor also allows you to add chocolate or fruit or any other flavor you choose to mix it up a little. A great addition to my morning breakfast. TL;DR Great NON-SOY protein powder"
"Great idea, carbonating fruit juice. Wife & I enjoyed the watermelon strawberry version better, though; it didn't seem to have the aftertaste and slight heaviness of the kiwi berry. Nonetheless it was quite good. TL;DR Swwwwweet but aftertaste"
these cookies are a perfect treat....very light and crunchy wafer sweetened by  the right amount of chocolate....great price and fast service TL;DR Delicious!!!!
"SO GOOD SO PERFECT SO TENDER SO MEATY SO TASTY SO DELICIOUS YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO EAT JUST ONE, BELIEVE ME I HAVE TRIED. ALL CAPS IS RUDE. TL;DR LEGENDARY"
"At an early age my Beagle (yes, a beagle) was picky about eating.  crushing a little freeze dried chicken liver on his food gave him the incentive to eat.  Now it has become part of the routine. TL;DR Picky Eater"
This is a great gluten free flour to use if you're in a hurry trying to cook something or anytime! I enjoyed making the gluten free banana bread on the back of the package. It was good but grainy. But when I don't have time or don't feel like mixing up some other gluten free flour blends or don't have any in the house it's great. TL;DR Great Gluten Flour if you're in a hurry or anytime!
"My Mother used to make these when she didn't feel like making them from scratch.  The box is much simpler and quicker to make and have a great taste.  Serve with a roast, brown gravy and a salad.  What a wonderful meal. TL;DR Panni Shredded Potato Pancakes"
my 1 yr pom loves rawhides so this is perfect!! shes been working at it for a few days!! i am buys A LOT more of these to keep her sane in her cage until i get home from work!! TL;DR she loves it!
"I bought this product for my picky toddler, and she actually eats it. I just wish there was a greater variety of veggies in the mix. TL;DR My toddler loves them"
"I have tasted a number of different kale chips, and I must say this is the very best out of all of them. If you love chocolate, you'll love these! It satisfies a sweet-tooth craving for sure!! TL;DR best kale-chip flavor!"
Loved this product. Taste good gave me energy and helped me drop a few sizes. Got here super quick and was reasonably priced. TL;DR Loved it!!
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BBY7ZC"">Nature's Best Bouquet</a> I had this bouquet sent to my mother for Mother's Day.  They arrived on time, in excellent condition.  My mother was thoroughly pleased and consequently so was I.  The bouquet is colorful and the price was excellent. Great product for the money.  Will have no hesitation in ordering the same through Amazon in the future.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BBY7ZC"">Nature's Best Bouquet</a> TL;DR Pleasing New Source for Flowers"
"I have Adult A.D.H.D. and this product works well for me. For those that do not know understand, ADD and ADHD people have an issue if various stimulants and relaxants having the opposite effect. For an example, Red-Bull will put me to sleep while a Benadryl will have me bouncing of the walls.<br /><br />5-Hour will not have me bouncing off the walls or falling asleep. It simply allows me to stay alert when I am otherwise dragging my but. In the end I don't even notice the effect until it wears off after 24+ hours of no sleep. TL;DR Works well with ADD"
"I MAKE A LOT OF FRUIT CAKES FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. LAST YEAR I MADE 13 CAKES AT A COST OF ABOUT $30.00 PER CAKE. BECAUSE I FOUND THIS 30 LB TUB OF CANDIED FRUIT FOR $68.00 MADE BY THE SAME COMPANY, MY COST PER CAKE HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY. I WAS PAYING $6.0O PER POUND FOR THE CANDIED FRUIT AND IT TAKES 2LBS OF THE FRUIT PER CAKE. SO INSTEAD OF $12.00 PER CAKE I NOW PAY JUST $2.26 PER POUND OF FRUIT SO I AM SAVING ABOUT $7.50 PER CAKE.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME AND IN GOOD CONDITION. TL;DR EXCELLENT STUFF!!"
"My husband bought a case of this just recently on Amazon and thought it was a great deal until I told him that you can buy it at Target for about $1.50 per bottle.  Also, when I opened a bottle last night, it was very flat and unappetizing.  Bottom line: save your money and buy it at the store! TL;DR Overpriced and flat when received"
I was excited to see these on Amazon. My kids love these fruit ropes & I have a hard time finding them in the store. TL;DR Great
"We eat so many of these McCormick Salad Toppins that it is much easier, more convenient and less expensive for us to purchase them online.  They are excellent to snack on, top salads with and put on baked or mashed potatoes.  YUM! TL;DR Online price is right for Salad Toppins!"
I have been using all the whey low products for a number of years.It is<br />absolutely the best.  The flavor and texture is indistinguishable from<br />sugar.  Give it a try - you will not be disapointed. TL;DR the absolutely best lo cal/carb sweetner ever
get this for my mom & she'd addicted. Its the only sure way to get a bit of fiber & protien into her (the rest is a battle). TL;DR easy nutrition
I brought this to my granddaughters 5th birthday party and all the kids love it. there was just the right amount for little kids thank you TL;DR big hit at birthday party
"We love Nature's Path cereals and especially this one.  But, we were very disappointed that the granola bars are not as good as the cereal is! TL;DR Not As Good as the Cereal"
"I've had regular quinoa before and although I did like it, it was a bit gritty. I wanted to give the pasta a try. I read some of the other reviews for this brand, I knew when ordering that this particular brand wasn't glutten-free. I like the taste( on the whole wheat tasting-side). It really came down to what my husband thought since he loves his pasta and since he liked it as well, I will be ordering this again. Oh, & I wanted to mention that on the box it says to boil your pasta for 6-9 minutes. I had to let it boil for a few extra minutes since I thought it was a little too on the al dente side. TL;DR Tastes good!"
I tried this wine once on a whim for something different. I've always been more a fan of red wine in general and the traditional Lambrusco red is a staple at our house...but I fell in love with this the first time I sipped it...it is slightly sweet but not overpoweringly sweet...goes wondeful with just about anything. If you like Lambrusco red you should definately try White Lambrusco. TL;DR white lambrusco
"Gustaf's rainbow candy laces are the best I've ever found.<br />They have very tasty distinct flavors, and the texture is perfect, not<br />too hard or soft, but just right! And because of their shoelace length they<br />are excellent for edible projects for kids to use for activites such as macrame, braiding or<br />knot tying practice. They can be frozen to keep their freshness and defrost without losing any quality.<br />Also, the price was quite reasonable, and delivery quick. You can't go wrong with Gustaf's rainbow laces! TL;DR The best candy laces!"
Have plenty of water handy.  The over-the-top taste of sea salt and cracked pepper nearly overcame all the cashew flavor.  The Emerald almonds were much more enjoyable because they were more subtlely flavored. TL;DR heavy seasonings get your attention
Delicious. I have a smoothie every morning I use a little of this with my fresh fruit and veggies. It tastes so good on a warm sunny day. Very good product. Would recomment to anyone and will buy again. The mixed berry is the best. TL;DR Very good
I put this flavorfull goodness on 86.42% of the food I eat at home and when I go out I find myself cra cra cra cravinggggg this stop to put on a big mac per say of the likes of chiles nachoooos. This is thee bomb. Like the one you need to try if you want to try the best most flavorfull sauce know to man. Mexicans really out did them selves here let me tell you. Straight beasting my g! TL;DR mexican style babyyy
"If you are a fan of specialty smoked salmon or prefer to select your fish at a seafood counter you may not care for Bear & Wolf.  This is almost right off the hook good.  It has that ""fishy"" taste that I actually prefer, but if you serve this up to those who don't care for it you'll be getting a thumbs down.  If you've tried the Kirkland brand, which is delightfully pink and flaky, you might be taken aback when you see and taste something from the wild.  I do not like most canned salmon because it is farmed ... some farming conditions are less than optimal (such a turn off).  This is wild Alaskan salmon that crumbles when you take a fork to it.<br /><br /> On the label it says, ""Satisfaction Guaranteed or your money refunded.""  If you like that right off the hook taste, you'll love it.  For those who want to know most of the information given on the label for one can:<br /><br />Ingredients: Alaskan Pink Salmon and Salt<br /><br />Net WT 6 OZ (170g)<br /><br />Naturally contains 325mg of Omega-3s per serving<br /><br />Nutrition Facts<br /><br />Serving Size 2 oz. drained<br />(57g - about 1/4 cup)<br />Servings about 3<br />Calories 60, Fat Cal. 10<br /><br />Amount/serving  DV*<br /><br />Total Fat 1g ....................................... 2%<br />Saturated Fat 0g ................................  0%<br />Trans Fat 0g<br />Polyunsat.

I bought these olive oil packets for backpacking. They generally are perfect for back country food to avoid the mess and weight of a bottle of olive oil. The down side is the packaging needs work. Five packets out of the 105 were empty. They had not leaked but were simply factory defects. Then after I had sorted through the whole box to see how many were like this the next day I found one of the packets had sprung a leak and made a mess over half the packets which made it very difficult to track down the leaking one. This also has me in doubt about the packaging durability for the high altitude pressure changes that I will be encountering. TL;DR Good but needs work
"This is a great buy, especially since my local stores can't seem to keep more than one on the shelf. TL;DR Great Bread Mix"
"Thank you for carrying this product. My husband and I used to go to Chi-Chi's Restaurant many years ago before<br />they closed in Bowling Green, Ky. The Cancun Seafood Enchilada and Sweet Corn Cakes were our favorite.  I was<br />able to find the recipe for the corn cakes in a cookbook I purchased, but I could never find the recipe for<br />the Cancun.  I made several attempts to prepare our favorite dish, but no matter what I tried, I couldn't<br />come close.  I finally just gave up, and then, a few weeks ago, I found the recipe on the internet.<br />I was so excited, and made my grocery list for the ingredients that were needed.  Well, I found everything<br />I needed, but you guessed it, the lobster base.<br /><br />I went back on-line and did a search on lobster base. After checking out all the companies that popped-up,<br />I decided on Amazon.com.  I found the amount and cost range I was looking for.  I placed my order and within<br />a few days I received it.<br /><br />I surprised my husband one night for dinner with our long-awaited favorite dish and when we took our first<br />bites, we looked at each other and smiled.  That was it, the taste I thought was lost forever, had been found.<br /><br />Thank you for giving me my missing ingredient......Better than Bouillon Lobster Base!!  Now I'm searching for<br />more recipes that I can use it in.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />P. Bush TL;DR I FOUND THE MISSING INGREDIENT AT LAST!!!!"
"In short, this stuff is pretty fantastic! I've been vegan for 5 years for reference. No, it's not anything like your Kraft Mac n' Cheese, but it has a great, savory flavor nonetheless. Do NOT buy this if you're expecting something that mimics cheddar. You'll especially like the flavor if you cook with nutritional yeast, go for it!<br /><br />The pasta cooks nicely, its whole wheat macaroni that takes a little longer to cook than white pasta would, but the consistency is as good as any other pasta if you cook it right and drain.<br /><br />I made my sauce with Rice Dream rice milk. Like any powdered sauce mix, I wouldn't suggest pouring the entire thing in the pot at once! Put your desired milk product in the pot, then slowly stir in the powder to make sure you work any lumps that develop from the powder. I've found this is easier to do while its on low heat. Then you can add the pasta and kick up the heat a little bit as you mix it. The sauce gets nice and creamy! So glad I got this! Good job, Road's End! YUMMY! TL;DR Closest to Mac n Cheese As A Vegan Can Get"
"Didn't think this coffee was good or bad- just blah.  So, if it's on sale, grab it if you need cheap coffee for days when you don't demand good taste while getting your caffeine dose. TL;DR Blah"
"Two little Yorkies basically love these little chicken wrapped biscuits.  Each morning each one gets 2 of them and they start the process of enjoying them.  Then after a few minutes they finish with a nice little mess.  I do not understand but near the end of the process they either just get tired of eating them or do not like them or they are suggesting that they want to share the leftovers with us.  Regardless, we always have a few pieces on the floor that have to be vacuumed.  No big deal, however.  There are three treats these critters love:  these biscuits, pig snouts and freeze dried livers.  I would love to have a return of all the money we have spent on other treats that did not make it to the eating condition.  Yorkies are blatantly picky (or at least these ones) and it's one sniff and eaten or gone to the neighbor's dogs.  Maybe that's where the expression ""gone to the dogs"" originates.  If you buy food and do not like it then give it to the dogs.  Bottom line:  great for us, love the little plastic container and they love the treats.  We'll be back for more. TL;DR Some Dogs love them; Owners question"
"These couldn't be easier.  You pour one packet into a bowl, add 2 cups of cold water, and microwave for 3-4 minutes.  They are already flavored, although I did add butter to mine as I didn't initially anticipate that they would be flavorful on their own.<br /><br />They have a bit of a sour bite which implies that there is some sour cream in the seasoning (I didn't bother to check).  It's not overbearing, but my first few bites took me aback a little as I was expecting more of the usual blandness from powdered mashed potatoes.  I also didn't need to add any salt, but I wouldn't say they were too salty; just right.<br /><br />I thought the flavor, texture, and quantity were good and better than many instant mashed potato products I've tried.  Each packet says it makes 4 servings (that would be 1/2 cup each); I would usually eat more than that for a serving; but they are filling, like real potatoes.  I'd guess for most people a packet makes 2-3 servings. TL;DR Surprisingly Good Considering You Only Add Water"
"I recieved this in timely manner. Was packed good. The taste is very good,if you taste it at all. No smoking if gets a little too hot. I liked the smaller bottles,so does'nt get old before using all of it.<br />Thanks TL;DR Tasty"
"These bowls are so yummy!  My son loves them.  However, they picture on the front does not accurately depict what is inside.  The inside is much more ""saucy"" and has very small bits of protein, grain, and veggie.  Therefore, I don't think a young tot could self-feed with efficiency.  Too much food would be wasted for the price! TL;DR Delicious, Nutritious, and Unique"
"I'm very happy with the variety of coffee in this pack and all of the cups arrived intact without damage, but like several other reviewers I was surprised to find that the actual ""gift pack"" presentation did not resemble the picture at all - product was loose in a smaller cardboard shipping box inside of a larger cardboard shipping box.  Not a big deal since I bought this package for myself, but I would've been disappointed if I was planning to give it as a gift.<br /><br />I did recieve the print in a cardboard tube, but the edges of the print were completely wrinkled and even torn in spots from where the tube was bent shut at the ends.  I didn't buy this product for the print so I don't really care, but thought it was worth mentioning in case anyone wants to collect the prints that come with this coffee. TL;DR Great variety, but glad""Gift Pack"" was not actually a gift"
Very good but too early to give final rating until we try other beans TL;DR coffee
"These are exactly the kind you can buy in the stores.  They taste great.  The box from Amazon includes 6 boxes.  Each Special K box has 7 packets.  Sometimes I only use 1/2 a packet per water bottle, but you can do it to your taste. TL;DR Tastes Great"
"I've always loved Chick O Stick. It is not the product that rates low. It is the price. Don't buy this product from this vendor, unless you like paying twice the price for the product. At .25 per piece (price is on each piece) at box of 24 should have only cost $6. This product was twice that amount. There are others that sell it for the correct unit price. Fool me, you just got an additional 6 bucks. I'll pay better attention next time. Thanks for the education. TL;DR Candy always great. Price not so much."
"My 20 month old absolutely loves these and they are a truly guilt free snack with lots of vitamin C. 5 stars for flavor and product, 2-3 stars for availability and delivery time... also they moisten up quickly so open a bag and use fast. Add to cream of wheat or oatmeal if you want to use up the dust or a bag that's been open too long. TL;DR 20 month old loves these"
Equally distributed amongst all flavors - Thanks so much! I enjoy it everyday and thanks to an awesome price my coworkers get to enjoy it too. Sharing is caring! TL;DR Amazing Lillipops
"Been using this for 3 weeks now. I was using another brand for about a month prior to using this. I liked the other brand but i wanted to see what else was out there and get the best. Well I'm done searching. This combines fruits and vegetables! I've been using this to supplement my breakfast and lunch throughout the day and i feel great!  I have more energy than before. I'm not getting tired halfway through the day anymore and i feel i have more mental focus.  I feel healthier than i ever have. I thought being ""regular"" was going once daily. Well since i've been taking this I go an hour after i eat usually. Overall hands down best product bar none. Get it from amazon too - in my local stores they are usually a good bit pricier. TL;DR Best green superfood powder out there. HANDS DOWN."
I received this from influenster in my mom voxbox and my kids loved this cookie. I didn't even get a chance to try it and had to purchase a box. I highly recommend this cookie... Its a great snack and a healthier one!!!! TL;DR Great Healthy Snack
"I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats . Unfortunetly , I cannot write a review because none of the cats would eat it . This is also true of the turkey and salmon flavor I purchased at the same time . Guess they just don't have a yen for a higher end cat food ! Sorry TL;DR Cat owner"
I'll gladly pay the extra $$$ for one last sip of America's greatest soda! R.I.P. Dublin Dr Pepper shame on you Dr Pepper Snapple! TL;DR Will gladly pay the extra price
"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006<br /><br />I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.<br /><br />It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.<br /><br />If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.<br /><br />If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.<br /><br />Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.<br /><br />While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.<br /><br />I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it. TL;DR deadly"
"When I was told by my nutritionist that eating a handful of whole, natural almonds a day would help me to lose weight and get the right kind of fats and proteins implemented into my diet, I was a bit skeptical.  I was not a huge almond fan to begin with.  I don't particularly enjoy salted or roasted almonds.  Usually only the kind that come surrounded with coconut and chocolate or the kind that you get out of the nut bowl to shell around the holidays.  The Whole Natural almonds by Blue Diamond taste like they came right out of the shell and boy are they yummy.<br /><br />I like that they are a satisfying snack and I like the taste of them.  These are the ones I buy ... no added salt or anything.  Nice and fresh right out of the shell.<br /><br />5 stars. TL;DR Tasty and Healthy - Good for Dieting"
"Fresh, unbroken, delicious and delivered fast.<br /><br />That qualifies for a five star rating. =)<br /><br />I pack these in 4 inside baggies and put them in the<br />freezer for lunches and snacking..<br />Perfect size and the right amount of calories.<br /><br />You get enough cookies for that amount of money. I am very<br />satisfied. TL;DR Five Star Rating."
"Our vet recommended getting ""C.E.T. chews"" to help clean our dog's teeth, so I looked around online and came across the VeggieDent chews and the HEXtra premium chews. Both of these met the requirement of being ""C.E.T chews"" but they looked (and sounded from the description) very different from each other, so I wasn't sure what kind to buy. Based on the reviews for each, it still wasn't clear what would work better, so I ordered one pack of each. I was worried that the VeggieDent chews would too easily be consumed and therefore wouldn't do much for cleaning her teeth, and I was worried that the HEXtra chews would be a choking hazard because they wouldn't come apart easily enough and she might swallow them whole.<br /><br />The VeggieDent chews were definitely easy for her to break pieces off of, but she was quite happy doing so, and it took her about 15s or maybe a bit more to eat it. She chewed each little piece that broke off while she ate it, and it was definitely cleaning her teeth. The HEXtra chews, however, are a choking hazard, and I will never give her another one. She was very excited to get the HEXtra chew (they smell terrible but apparently good to a dog) and chewed on it for a second or two, and then in one quick gulp it was gone. The whole chew, still in one piece. It was in her mouth for about 2 seconds. She is a VERY strong chewer (she can take chunks off of a black kong easily in 30 seconds or so, and she's a medium-large dog), and had no desire to chew pieces off of the HEXtra chew, I'm guessing because the moistened chew seemed like something to be swallowed whole. The HEXtra chews were useless for cleaning her teeth and a choking hazard, and I would never give her another one.<br /><br />In summary, the VeggieDent chews were great for cleaning our dog's teeth (though they didn't last particularly long, but if you're looking for something to last long, try a kong product), while the HEXtra chews did nothing for our dog's teeth and were also a choking hazard because she swallowed it whole within a second or two.<br /><br />Note: I've posted this review for the VeggieDent chews as well, in case it's useful for people who may be debating between these two types of C.E.T. chews. TL;DR UNSAFE - choking hazard - try VeggieDent chews instead"
"The product itself is great, it's the bag that needs work.  I recommend that instead of microwaving them in the bag, spread them out on a paper plate or a microwave safe plate then popping them in the microwave for about 90 seconds.  You do have to watch these cook though or they will burn on you. I really like the pork rinds themselves and they are a healthy alternative to chips though they are a little salty. TL;DR great product, bad design"
"These are very tasty, and super flavorful.  The garbanzos are very firm.  Looks nasty like dog food, but tastes great and ready in 90 seconds in the microwave. TL;DR very tasty and easy"
I was disappointed in the product. I would not recommend or buy this product again. I threw out the product.  It didn't taste good. TL;DR regret product
Not as good as the whole bean I usually purchase. The whole bean was not available. It is back in stock now and it will continue to be my first choice. TL;DR Caffe Appassionato Decaf coffee
"This product was very fun & easy to use. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it. The first time he made the rice, it came out perfectly. The directions are very clear and everything included is useful. Just make sure you have a very sharp knife! TL;DR Fun & Easy"
"I love chocolate in all forms, including good chocolate cereal.  So I had high hopes for this cereal.  Unfortunately, it just was not that tasty to me.  It has a slight artificial taste, especially after the first few bites.  The artificial taste faded a bit as I continued to eat, but I still felt that for a chocolate cereal, it just didn't taste that chocolatey.  There are much better chocolate cereals out there.  This cereal seems to be trying to be a healthier chocolate cereal which is an admirable goal, but personally if I am going to eat a healthy cereal I would just rather have Cheerios.  No artificial taste there!<br /><br />Overall, I found this just to be an OK cereal, nothing special. TL;DR Not very tasty"
"Mums are the absolute best.  I have not found any product that compares to it's food content and eatability.  Unlike many of the other ""teethers"" mum-mums do not get all messy and disintegrate in the baby's hand.  They rapidly dissolve in the baby's mouth -- no concern about choking.  I discovered them for my grandchild -- wish I had had them 30 years go! TL;DR Baby mum-mum's"
I have bought these ar grocery stores before and really like them but they are expensive. Initially I was afraid that I would be getting crumbs via mail but they turned out whole. Amazon did a great job packaging them. They are light and a fairly healthy alternative to other mid morning or afternoon snacks. I have lost a lot of weight but I love my sweets and these satisfy my craving for sweets....just don't eat a bag at one sitting which would be easy to do. TL;DR good price for a delcious product
Fantastic and delicious after a workout! This is probably the best electrolyte replenishing drink on the market! Coconut water is even better than intravenous fluids per some medical literature I have read. TL;DR Mounds bar in a bottle!
This was a gift from my Lil Sis.  Awesome.  Great flavor.  Can taste berries and rhubarb.  I love it.  Most likely will order more. TL;DR DELICIOUS
"I wish I could give this 10 stars!  After I stopped breastfeeding my sweet happy baby became a screaming unhappy baby.  His poo became so pasty that he would scream and turn blood red in the face from trying to poop.  The doctor told me to try prune, apple, or pear juice to ""help it along"".  After a few days of giving him that every day he went back to screaming baby again.  Things were so bad that he gave himself a hemorrhoid before he was even 5 months old!  I tried EVERY formula that the stores sold and there was never any change.  A friend of mine told me about high iron concentrations causing constipation in one of her friends babies and maybe I might look into that.  After looking through every store in the towns around me I started searching online to see if this even existed.  Luckily I found this on Amazon!!  I started giving this to my baby a few weeks ago and the change is AMAZING!  I have my sweet baby back!!  The poo has gotten back to normal and this formula has made a WORLD of difference!!!  If your baby is constipated or having issues having a bowel movement you should really try this!!!  Really wish the typical stores carried this but Amazon is easy to order through and I have not had any issues and I have now ordered my 3rd case! TL;DR Saved the day and brought back my baby!!!!"
"We switched our baby boy from the regular similac to this after we saw bloody stool. It is more expensive than other types of formula, but the blood cleared within two weeks like the pedi said, so it was well worth it. Our son also had reflux but this formula did not seem to help any. FYI for anyone wondering if this is cheaper than the powder- yes, it is. However, if your baby eats 32oz a day, you're basically saving $0.80 (yes, cents!) a day using powder($162.79 for six 1lb cans) vs Ready to Feed ($53.94 for six 32oz bottles). IMO I'd rather pay the $0.80 and not have to mix the stuff myself. TL;DR great for babies with milk protein allergy"
My huge Akita Loves this treat....It's ugly and creepy....but she is dances around in joy when she sees this treat in my hand.  I really don't understand.  Nice thing...Made in the USA!  Packaged with lots of Love. TL;DR Why does my dog loves this treat?
I was diagnosed with Celiac Sprue and a gluten intolerance in 2002. I have never found a gluten free pancake mix as good as this one is. They taste just like flour made pancakes. I have fed them to my grown children and my grandchildren and they can't tell the difference. TL;DR Great Pancakes
anything this rabbit endorses has to be good. Very cheesey and very tasty. also much more affordable via amazon compared to our local excuses for grocery stores. A+++ TL;DR Bernie's Pasta is the greatest
"About a year ago, I purchased a 6 oz popcorn machine for my business in order to give my customers some free snacks while they are in my store.  I purchased these 6 oz popcorn packs and love them.  I do not have to worry about portions or measuring.  Everything comes in a handy serving pack with the correct mixture.  Super easy! No mess either.  I love it!  The popcorn is delicious and I have to sometimes keep myself from eating it all. TL;DR Easy way to make popcorn"
"This thing is huge.  At full height it won't fit on the counter under the kitchen cabinets.  So definitely think about where you'll put this before you buy it.  Also, the output wasn't what I expected.  I've grown the herb kit and the tomato kit.  It's easier to grow tomatoes outside than in this thing.  I got a lot of dill from the herb kit, not much else.  I don't even use dill that much.  I'll definitely stick with an outdoor garden next year. TL;DR Wait until price drops"
"I purchased two bags of these Wonderful Pistachios, and both of the bags I received were good.  So, I ordered them again.  The second time I ordered them, in each of the two bags I received, were so many either burned or rotted pistochios...about half of each bag had to be thrown away.  The last straw was when I cracked one that looked only mildly burned and discovered to my horror a WORM!  In addition to the worm was a lot of weird-looking, brown matter.  DISGUSTING!!!!  Needless to say, I found them far less than ""wonderful"" and will NOT be buyng them again. TL;DR Worms!"
"I tried this tea in the flowering combo that came with the teapot box. Now I'm here to buy it on its own. It's the best in the assortment in my opinion.<br /><br />Just as you take a sip, the sweet scent of jasmine combines with the lush flavor, and WOW! A real delight. The tea is very light and subtile yet strongly jasmine. Then there's the flowering effect. This is my favorite bloom of them all. All these tiny little tea balls slowly unwind, dancing under water, swimming and growing until the pot is full of delightful little flowers. Absolute perfection.\<br /><br />And it's good for your body and the planet. :o) TL;DR Heaven"
"I have been looking for a great breakfast that is healthy, yet filling...I found it! TL;DR great breakfast!"
"I've tried a million kinds of energy drinks but these 5-hour energy shots always work the best for me. I have a lower tolerance so I only need half of one of these to get a good effect. They taste pretty good for an energy drink. They are a fruity berry flavor with hints of multivitamin. They last for at least five hours. I'll take them around 7 or 8 pm if I have to stay up studying and sometimes they'll keep me up until 2-3 in the morning. TL;DR Works great, tastes great"
"Best ice tea ever.  I gave up drinking regular tea because of the caffeine.  I found this tea and have never missed regular tea,  It taste like regular tea with lemon. TL;DR Great Tea"
"I've tried various Energy Bars and Gluten Free Bars and the GFB is, by far, the best tasting bar I've had.  Additionally, after reading the quality ingredients of the GFB, I felt even better about eating it.  I highly recommend all the GFB flavors!  My favorite is the Cranberry and Toasted Almond! TL;DR Best Tasting Gluten Free Bar!!!"
"Unfortunately I haven't tried many mustards outside of the typical american brands (those being regular and gourmet)<br />But, this mustard is definitely much better than ANY American brand.<br /><br />As for the packaging, it was adequate. It came in a card board box wrapped tightly within three layers of bubble wrap. It really looks like you would have to take a sledge hammer to it, if you wanted to break these jars.... TL;DR Very good spicy mustard"
These crackers/thins are so good and not particularly fattening.  They have some salt to them which makes them good.  Most stores don't carry them so I liked the idea of ordering a Pack of 12 via Amazon.com.<br /><br />Janet TL;DR Sesmark crackers
"This is one of the only ""treats"" that last longer than 5 minutes with our Golden Retriever.  They smell horrible but he likes them, and that's what matters! TL;DR Stinky, But My Dog Loves Them!"
If your looking to add extra B Vitamins to the diet this is the way to go ;)<br />I love the cheesy flavor I just about put it on anything even in fruit smoothies. TL;DR Braggs Nutritional Yeast
"Bought this to clean our eight year old dishwasher. Now, every three to four weeks, we run the dishwasher empty with only the citric acid added. We fill the soap dispenser with it, then when the dishwasher's in the middle of its cycle, we open the door and add a little more. Does a great job cleaning the dishwasher and getting rid of any built up residue, etc. Dishwasher looks like new afterwards.<br /><br />Works as well as the Dishwasher Magic product (its active ingredient is citric acid -- 3 ounces of it in each 12 ounce bottle) and ends up being less than one-third the cost. TL;DR Works great as a dishwasher cleaner"
I love this tea. I am a person that usually needs sugar in my teas but this one requires very little to none. I like the ease of use of the K-cups! TL;DR Great tea!!!
I bought this as an ingredient for inhibiting cats from urinating on certain areas (with cinnamon oil and sds detergent) but I am using it for a lot of my soups and other recipes that ask for lemon grass -- which I cannot obtain in my local stores. Great product! Tasty! Can't imagine why cats don't like it.... TL;DR great product
I grew up on this. Everyone has always said my moms and now my spagetti is the best. We are so glad to find it again. Its not easy to find here. TL;DR Everybody loves my spagetti
"This vinegar is great because you can buy it bulk and save. I can't even find Balsamic at Costco in this quantity and at this price.<br /><br />This balsamic is perfect for making your own dressings, vinaigrette and marinades. It's also wonderful if you like to make reductions for glazes or if you just want to concentrate it and put it in a squeeze bottle for garnishing dishes.<br /><br />Flavor is very good so you're not getting some bargain brand balsamic vinegar taste. You know the kind I'm talking about where it's basically red wine vinegar with food coloring and caramel color added in order to make it look like balsamic.<br /><br />You will not go wrong with this purchase if you use Balsamic vinegar frequently. TL;DR Great All Purpose Vinegar"
"I enjoy popcorn in a variety of forms.  Cooked on the stove, in the microwave, made into caramel corn, etc.  My favorite, though, has to be that yellow, salty variety you get at the local movie or bar.  I could eat that stuff until.. well... I'm stuffed.<br /><br />I've tried to reproduce that theater flavor at home, but failed miserably until I bought Flavacol.  Sprinkle some of this on microwave popcorn, and it's a close approximation of the movie theater variety.<br /><br />But pop the corn in coconut oil and season it with this (or better yet, put this in with the oil), and what you've got will taste just like you bought it at your local movie house.<br /><br />The best thing about Flavacol, though, is that a little goes a long way.  You'll be able to pop huge amounts of corn before you use up this container. TL;DR 80% of the 'theater popcorn' equation"
"This is absolutely my favorite tea. My college campus used to serve it until we switched vendors; I've gone out of my way several times to hunt it down. TL;DR Faovrite Tea, Hands Down"
"For me, hands down the best coffee I ever had in my Senseo. A bit pricy but outstanding flavor. I am happy to have coffee in little filter pods and not plastic cups like other coffee makers. TL;DR coffee pods"
"Although this plant is smaller than I could tell from the photo, it was a healthy plant when shipped.  I sent this as a gift for a good friend and would have rather been able to note this by the seller, since he had to guess it was from me upon its arrival! (It was supposed to be a surprise birthday gift) TL;DR Healthy plant, timely shipping"
Nice to have these organic walnuts.  My kids love them and they are a healthy snack.  I give them at their lunch for an extra cookie treat. TL;DR cook mama
this is my first time using these pods since the senseo pods were discontinued. they are excellent & robust in flavor. the pods are packaged individually for long lastng freshness. i would highly recommend these pods to anyone who has this type of coffee system. TL;DR WOLFGANG PUCK COFFEE PODS
"I bought a case after reading such great reviews. UGH!! I spit it out. Was VERY VERY strong tasting, but not a pleasant taste at all. I thought well maybe its just me, so I have a few friends that are celiac so I shared with them. Same reaction, this 1 used it in her turkey thinking well its strong but maybe with a big turkey, oh my no 1 could eat it. I really don't know how people can say these are good, I only got the original flavor, it really was terrible, I threw them away. I know some people get paid to leave a review on here, I don't know if that is the reason for the good review or what. Usually the reviews help me decide what products to try with Celiac, but wow you guys were WAY OFF for me anyway. I threw the whole case away. IT was the only thing in the trash that the raccoons didnt get into for real. buyer beware~~!!! TL;DR These are the worse tasting product I have ever had!"
I love this product. It's a great replacement for a latte when there is no barista around.  It's a tad on the sweet side for me (I usually don't take any sugar in my coffee) but very yummy.  Put some in your backpack when you go camping or take some to work for that instant pick-me-up.  I like it better than the new instant coffee from S*bucks. TL;DR Great when there's no barista around!
Go to Nespresso.com and get them for half the price: DON'T BUY THESE. No reason for them to be available on Amazon; it is deceptive. TL;DR Rip Off
"Despite what one reviewer wrote, this is a decent price compared to other retailers.  One should consider the size of the container when comparing prices. TL;DR This is a decent price"
My baby likes this. It stains all over but I have the time to clean up :D It's great as a first food. Quite liquidy in my opinion and I would prefer it to be a tad less sweet. But that's not a biggie since I mix it in with his plain cereal. TL;DR Good but I find it a little on the sweet side
"The vanilla beans I received were high quality - nice and moist. Also, they were delivered exactly when they were supposed to be, which was important to me. :) TL;DR Great quality"
Of course I don't think it's as yummy as Rudy does but it seems as if he's enjoying it....and it's good for him!  ARWest TL;DR Healthy pet
As an occasional snack and supplement my 8 month old loves these. They are soft enough that he can eat them with no problem and he is able to pick them up with ease. They do have a fair amount of sugar to them which is why I said occasional. TL;DR 8 month old loves them
"The flavor is as deliciously natural as only raw honey can taste. My nephew is alergic to regular ""heated/processed"" honey, but he can have as much of this as he wants! TL;DR Not just Naturally DELICIOUS it's healthy!"
"I love Salmon Pate', its great with crackers or in Salmon Crochets.  I first had this on a cruise and never forgot the great taste, its one of my favorites. TL;DR A great finger food"
"After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of ""real"" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as ""modest"". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite ""type"" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my ""fix""; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it! TL;DR Not nearly as good as Bissinger's French Long"
"Definitely NOT unscented, it has a men's scent to it...However, it is the first time in my life I have been able to stand such a scent, as it is relatively mild once out of the shower. I have not broken out from the stuff, either.<br />Also, I am a man with a short haircut, and it works as a shampoo for me. No flakes, soft hair. Nice to have one bottle for hair, face & body. TL;DR First ""scented"" bodywash I can stand to use"
"Tea is ok, not as good as we were expecting.  We had this tea at the local sushi bar and it was amazing, this was good but not as good....maybe a little aged and lots some of it flavor.<br /><br />Shipping took about 12 days so if your in a hurry.....buy from some one else. TL;DR OK, not great"
"Have been using this product for thirty years, unable to obtain it thru retail grocery outlets.  Thanks for your help TL;DR Spaghetti Sauce Mix"
"This is great dog food, especially for those of us who have trouble feeding our dogs lamb, chicken, or red meat.  I avoided this food for a long time because of the celebrity connection to Dick Van Patten of ""Eight is Enough.""  For all I know he may not even own the company anymore, but he clearly associated with some knowledgeable people to produce this food.  The ingredients are top grade and the calorie count is excellent: The fish has 323 calories, and the vege has 344 calories, per cup.  This is important when you have any dog, but especially small dogs. My local independent pet store sells this for $13.00. TL;DR Dogs love it"
"I have been drinking this everyday mixed with orange juice in the morning for the past 2 years. Mixing with Orange juice makes it more palatable. Otherwise, it is quite tart undiluted.<br /><br />It helps greatly in controlling infections of the Urinary Tract. Drinking and experiencing is believing. TL;DR Daily combination with Orange Juice works wonders for your health"
"This is an awesome product. I work at a weight loss camp as a nutrition and culinary instructor, which means that one of my duties is to serve snack to the campers twice a day. This one is a FAVORITE around here with the kids AND staff! You can prepare it using applesauce or yogurt, like the box says. Both come out really awesome. They do tend to be a bit gooey when you cut them--not a huge problem though! There is enough stability to cut pieces and serve them for sure. Awesome product. I will be purchasing some when I go home from camp! TL;DR No Pudge!"
"Unfortunately, I was shipped the ""medium roast"" instead of the ""espresso roast"" and did not notice this until after I had opened it and brewed a cup. Can anything be done to correct this error?<br />Thanks, Marsha TL;DR Received the wrong product!"
Works like a charm and does the job. The price is awesome! It's like only a dollar :) it floats my boat! TL;DR Great.
"These singles sell for $2.50 - $3.36 at the store for 1 box of 24 singles. I'm not sure why Amazon is selling it for $9.99 for a box of 24 singles.  Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy. TL;DR Rip off Price"
brews well even stands up to sweetner and a little milk if you like it that way TL;DR relax
"I found this to be an excellent and reasonably priced Earl Grey. It has full flavor, but not bitter. It is as good as any Earl Grey out there.<br /><br />I was so pleased with it, I put in on the Amazon Subscribe and Save, and have regular deliveries at a nice savings. TL;DR Excellent"
"I have been sprouting Alfalfa seeds for years.  I thought I would try this mix and was pleasantly surprised.  The radish gives it just enough of a bite to be interesting, but not overwhelming. TL;DR Nice ""bite"" not too spicy"
"This item has 32 ounces, two pounds of Caraway Seeds. If you bake its a buy. TL;DR What A Deal if you bake Irish Soda Bread"
"This decaf coffee doesn't taste like alot of other decaf coffee's I tried.<br />It is a full flavored coffee, I best I ever drank. TL;DR coffee"
"I used it in a few cakes and macarons, it was good quality product.<br />I'll probably get the same product next time. TL;DR Very good"
"Perhaps it's the additional ingredients (organic maltodextrin, organic corn starch, organic sunflower lecithin), but this stuff tastes really awful.  I have an 8 month old, and added less water to make it thicker.  All that really accomplished was to make the powder less dilute & the pungent flavor even stronger.  My child wouldn't eat this until I mixed it in with some other food.  I'll use what I have left to add to other food for the nutritional value that the powders offer, but I was really surprised & disappointed in this product.  How do you mess up something so simple as sweet potatoes?  Great idea, poor execution & way too expensive for this product. TL;DR Not a fan - taste leaves something to be desired"
Dog loves them.  Small size make handling the treat best used for stationary training. TL;DR Outstanding dog training treat with minimum calories
"Companies like this go to great lengths to try to disguise the fact that their products are made in China. Some are advertsing ""Made under US supervision"". In this case they keep emphasizing that their products are ""tested in the US"". I wrote to them asking where the product was manufactured and they never responded but it appears that the products are actually made in China. ""Tested in the US"" means close to nothing as they obviously cannot test every single treat. In the last few years the FDA has issued three warnings about chicken tender/jerky treats made in China and their harmful effects on dogs. Thus you are taking a real risk by buying a product like this. Curiously in the case of this product it is not any cheaper than buying a similar one MADE in the US so I can see absolutely no reason to buy these. I fully appreciate that dogs like these types of treats. I know of no dog that does not. However I also know of no dog that reads FDA reviews, notices or warnings and thus the responsibility for buying the proper safe treats is on you - not the dog.<br /><br />Follow-up: Company has now replied and these treats are made in China. TL;DR Stay away from products like these made in China"
"I am a teacher with very little time for lunch. I am also a forest roamer. These things are great. Perfect size. Easy to eat in a short period of time. TASTY!!!!!! Try these box lunches folks, they really are Lunchables for adults. TL;DR Five Stars Plus...if possible."
"I first tried quality English tea when we spent a month in Oxford visiting a friend and I've been trying to find good tea ever since.  This is VERY much better than any other tea that I've tried. If you really like a STRONG cup of tea that isn't totally bitter then this is the one for you.  FYI: I like this better than PG Tips, another popular English tea. TL;DR Best English Tea I've found in the USA"
"Best cat litter ever!  I will never go back to clay litter. Smells like a pine forest, even after my cat has filled it with c#@p!  I don't normally order it on line, but we were moving cross-country and I had it sent to the new apartment so it was waiting when we got there, which it was, which made the move a little less stressful.  At least for me. My cat still hates moving. TL;DR love it!"
"Many people seem to really be able to tell the difference between the different LavAzza varieties, I really cannot. I have tried several now and enjoy them all.<br /><br />One thing I know for sure.....there is NO WAY anyone that actually likes Starbucks should bother. If you like that crud, you just will not be able to appreciate really good espresso.<br /><br />LavAzza is.......really GOOD espresso. TL;DR Darn good espresso!"
"The price is good, and the delivery is fast! I hope the price will not go up in case for me to buy them in a fix plan. TL;DR Very good!"
"I have a Keurig and I am tired of spending a ton on K-cups. I bought this coffee and Cafejo's Pod Adaptor for Keurig Brewers <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008004ZFI"">Cafejo Colombian Coffee Pods, Two (18-Count) Boxes with one Single Cup Pod Adaptor</a> and not only it the coffee way better, but it's half the price. Thank you Cafejo. TL;DR Great Coffee... Great Value!"
"This ""whenever bar"" contains organic ingredients and is wheat and dairy-free. It does contain eggs and it is sweetened with agave nectar, which is really not so good for those sensitive to sugar. To me this item tasted like ""health food"" cookies I've had in the past - pretty tasty but not really that healthy for you since they are high in sugar content and contain cooked oils. I wouldn't use these regularly myself but I found this much better than products that are full of refined ingredients like hydrogenated oils and corn syrup. TL;DR A healthier snack bar"
"For a milk chocolate, truly a great one! Try it. Very high quality. The only problem with it is that it doesn't last that long in contrary to Manjari(or any other dark chocolate), because everyone likes it. TL;DR Jivara Lactee 3kg"
"Great taste, very refreshing.  Comes in other flavors too.  Just sweet enough for me so I don't add sugar at all. TL;DR Very delicious"
"this is the best coffee I have ever tasted, and I have drank a lot of coffee over the years. I would like to know why this particular coffee is not sold in local grocery stores? I can find it at the Sam's Club stores, but not at local stores. Please think about selling at the grocery stores. TL;DR delicious"
I thought the niblet size of the food was great BUT My cats just nibble at it now-I have never gotten DUCK before BUT my cats used to eat Wilderness like popcorn-the chicken variety.that is.I have 8 cats and my two youngest 4 and 6 months eat the duck pretty regularily but they just nibble little at a time.The formula is(IS) better for them.Quess it will last longer.Incidently I think Blue Buffalo is a bit overpriced.Package-bag of food was delivered rapidly and in excellent condition TL;DR Blue Buffalo Wilderness-Duck
"I saw the line of Bar Harbor products in my local store.  Being an enthusiast of chowder, I bought a can of the Fish Chowder and brought it home to have for supper.  Much to my surprise, the can does not suggest how much milk/cream to mix into the concentrate to get it right.  Instead, the directions say only ""...add milk or cream to desired consistency...""  So I followed the suggestion in this Amazon product review (a half-pint:  why not call it a cup instead?)and now have chowder that is thin.  I am wondering how many cans must I buy and waste at $4 per to solve the proper amount of milk or creme to add?<br /><br />Jerry TL;DR Took a gamble and lost"
"Matouk's Mango Kuchela is my favorite ""secret"" ingredient for so many dishes.  I add it to stews, bean soups, salad dressings, etc.  It brings out flavors beautifully. TL;DR my secret ingredient"
"I just received this product and I am very disappointed.<br />The description led me to believe that the product included its own cup and the convenience was the ONLY reason I purchased it.<br />What I got was a box filled with little bags of noodles and little bags of powdered cheese.<br />Not so easy after all! If I had wanted the basic original version I would have ordered Kraft mac and cheese...<br />As it is, I feel like I am the victim of a bait and switch routine!<br /><br />Here is the actual product description copied and pasted from the page here on the Amazon site:<br /><br />Consumers in the US are turning to Kraft Easy Mac cups for the great taste of macaroni and cheese. Easy Mac cups are simple to prepare - just add water and put in the microwave for a few minutes - plus they are portable with a disposable cup that makes clean-up easy. Easy Mac cups are perfect for any need-to-eat-now occasion. Kraft Easy Mac cups is available in several flavors like original, triple cheese, bacon, cheesy taco, roasted garlic parmesan and Alfredo.<br /><br />Please note the frequent use of the word ""cups"" and the inclusion of the statement ""plus they are portable with a disposable cup that makes clean-up easy.""<br /><br />I can't help but feel ripped off...<br />I would not recommend this product to anyone - it is grossly overpriced for what you get.<br />And I will never order this product again.<br /><br />Unless you want to pay top dollar for tiny little snack-sized bags of mac & cheese, DO NOT buy this product.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035XVQF2"">Kraft Easy Mac Original Macaroni and Cheese Dinner 18 Microwaveable Single Serve Packs</a> TL;DR not so easy"
"I don't know what happened, but these beans are not very good.  They are dry, fairly bland and just not what I come to expect from Coffee Bean Direct. My boss turned me onto Coffee Bean Direct (from now on referred to as CBD) about a year ago and I fell in love with the variety and freshness. Six months ago or so I found that CBD is now available on Amazon and was a very happy camper since I am a Prime member. The first five pounds I received were the same that I came to expect from the CBD roasters, but now on my second order, Costa Rican Tarrazu seems like they shipped some really old product that is very much past it's prime.  Maybe the CBD Costa Rican Tarrazu are not that popular and have sat in a warehouse waiting for some unlucky person like me.  I would throw them out if I hadn't spent so much on them, I don't even want to mix them with something else since I don't want to ruin another batch of good coffee.<br /><br />I hope it is just a fluke, but I'm not sticking around to find out, too much money to gamble.  I have now found another vendor for my fresh coffee addiction which is unfortunately a bit more expensive, however it IS fresh, oily and so tasty. TL;DR Subpar Coffee Beans"
"For those of us that have to watch our sugar these are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Libby's makes a whole line of these Splenda sweetened fruits and they are all high quality, great tasting products. They come in plastic jars with screw off ring and cap lids. TL;DR Great no sugar added fruit"
"Like a lot of people, I guess, I got scared of chicken jerky made in China. Even though I used a very respectable brand that's sold broadly in every major chain (Dogswell), I still felt a little queasy. So I bought this stuff, which is made in Colorado. Colorado! What better state for dogs than Colorado? Great terrain changes, fresh air, active residents--boy, was this jerky gonna be great. Only it wasn't. It was rock-hard. My Havanese are 15 and 18 pounds, so there's no way they're getting a whole strip; i break off pieces. I cannot do so with this product, except to break a strip in half. The only reason this product didn't get one star is that my dogs seem to like whatever bite-sized pieces I'm able to create by using a hammer. TL;DR Since When Are Strips of Brick Jerky?"
"this product was shipped to my door in timely manner and the product is very nice, delicate, and helpful ingredient addition to my kitchen.  the price is probably high but it beats a blank that i find in the local markets around my neighborhood. TL;DR nice product"
Helps keep my always hungry teen full.  Was so tired of buying every box of this in my grocery store every week that I decided to auto order. What a great deal. TL;DR Feeding a teen
"This is a spice I've only been able to find in Texas, but thanks to Amazon I can have as much as I like whenever I like!  People...this is the one and only spice you'll ever need in the world for BBQ chicken. Throw everything else you have out. I don't even use BBQ sause when I cook with Fiesta Seasonings. They also have a great steak seasoning and you won't want to use anything but that on your BBQ steaks either. Trust me. If you like to BBQ stock up on this stuff. TL;DR MPATL"
"I thought this might be a step up from my favorite Best Foods that I've been using all my life, but it really isn't that different to my tastes.  Not saying it's not very good, but I won't buy it again since Best Foods is so easily available. TL;DR Ho-hum."
This is a good green tea. It is balanced and doesn't have that often grassy taste that green teas tend to have. I would assume that is due to the fact that it is a mix with white tea also. Definitely better than most other green teas ! TL;DR Good balanced Green Tea
"This coconut oil was a good price, arrived promptly, and was just as described. I used this coconut oil in cold-process soap making, and it worked wonderfully. TL;DR Great"
"This is a very tasty snack mix.  Its pretty simple because its only cheddar bunnies, parmesan bunnies, and pretzel bunnies, but they are delicious and my kids love them! TL;DR Yum"
"I made this with Eggbeaters, olive oil (not extra virgin so a mild taste), and rice milk.  The batter was very thick and had to be spread rather than poured into the pan.  The instructions stipulated using a 9"" square gray non-stick pan which I do not own so I used glass Pyrex instead, sprayed with oil, and it baked just fine with zero stickage.  As it baked it rose up nice and high and turned golden brown on top.  I had not had cornbread since I went GF so this was a huge treat.  I would not hesitate to make this for company. TL;DR Excellent cornbread"
"My dog is 14 going on 15 she is a mixed breed chow chow and she has some aches and pains that have become more prominent. She is very picky and refuses pills. Well she likes this product so much when added to her food she expects it before she eats. I was thrilled! It has helped her bounce right back to her young self, thank goodness someone created this product! TL;DR My Dog Loves this Product and she is so picky!"
"Such a disappointment! The first requirement of a lemon-flavored tea is that there be a lemon flavor. The reason for Richardson'e almost total failure to achieve this is seen in the ingredient list, which starts with dried honey. While there is a hint of lemon eventually, there is no comparison with Stash's Meyer Lemon tea - which uses Myer Lemon oil, as well as lemongrass, to assure that the advertised flavor is present. I'll be pitching the box. TL;DR Where's the lemon?"
Excellent used in cereal. The strawberry flavor predominates. A great combo of 2 fruits. A satisfying taste sensation! TL;DR Great dried fruit
"While I am no fan of coffee, other members in my household love it.  This got rave reviews.<br /><br />This looks like it comes in a tea bag.  It's easy to make; you just brew it for a few minutes and wring it out.  You can make it the way you make tea by applying the bag concept.  This was a big hit with the coffee hounds.<br /><br />. TL;DR For the Coffee Hound"
The item received is okay but not a good value.  The oranges are very very small and nothing like the picture.  You probably get a better value going to your local grocery store.  Would I purchase this item again?  Probably not. TL;DR Just okay
"These are the best! They are light & crispy yet not crumbly. They have the right amount of sweetness & fruit taste and are not high in the ""bad stuff"" (calories, etc). The strawberry ones are great, too.  These are my new favorite snack!!! TL;DR These are awesome!"
"I am a lifelong drinker of Bourbon. I am 70 years old, so perhaps I may know something about Bourbon.<br />When I visited my brother in the Catskill Mountains he treated me to ""Hudson Baby Bourbon Whiskey"". The best bourbon that I have ever drank. I must say that I have tasted perhaps most of the high quality bourbons distilled in America.<br />I am hooked on this Bourbon, hook, line and sinker! TL;DR Peter J. Piaseckyj"
"I love these and have ordered them multiple times.  I put them in a pan with my whole oats and soak them for the night, cook it in the morning for breakfast, makes my day.  Love the stuff.  Always fresh and crispy. TL;DR Great tasting, fresh"
I can not imagine not having this most delicious and relaxing beverage. I take mine in the evening and always become relaxed and then spend beautiful time with my family and friends. Simply the best for a calm close of the day. TL;DR Just sip and relax
Thank you for the speedy service. I received my 2 packages of tea bags within 3 days of ordering them. This tea is part of a Mother's Day gift for my mom. She has a difficult time locating caffeine free in the stores. I will shop for my tea here again. Thanks!!! TL;DR Celestial Caffeine Free Tea 40 Bags
"This is a great product.  I have a big Lab and a Siberian Huskey puppy who both love these rolls.  I used to purchas them at Costco.  I gave it a four star rating because I'm a little disappointed about the price going up [..] a bag, in less than a year! TL;DR excellent product but cost has gone way up!"
Yaya's White Cheddar Jalapeno popcorn is very good. I have been eating it for some time and have never come across a stale bag. It is air opoed then misted with oil to hold the flavor powder. That light misting of oil means the popcorn is not totally crisp in the way a dry kernel might. It is good quality corn and makes a great snack. This White Cheddar Jalapeno is great. The chili flavor is light and there is no heat to speak of. TL;DR Yaya's Makes Good Popcorn
"When our order arrived, we busted open the crackers and this product.  We opened three tins.  There was not a single mussel in any of them.  Each tin had one little olive and a couple pieces of carrot.  Plenty of fish fillets but desperately in need of salt.  Be prepared to bring salt to your snacking table.<br /><br />Honestly, why pay the price when you can go to the 99 cent store and buy sardines and mussels for a dollar or two for a dollar?  Will not purchase this product again. TL;DR Nothing Beyond The Ordinary"
"I love my Keurig coffee maker however, I also like saving money and not spending too much on the pods. This is by far my favorite collection of strong coffees. I am so hooked on this specific collection I just don't like any other coffee they way I love the coffee from this collection. For the price if you get Amazon prime I believe this is the best bang for your buck. Please note there are no flavored coffees in this collection, so if you want hazelnut or chocolate this is not the collection for you. TL;DR I Love Cofee and I am Thrifty"
I loved Honey Grahm Crackers when I was growing up and these have the same flavor. I can see someone saying the perfect size to make Smoores or ice cream sandwich. Instead of the long 4 piece packaging with many crackers this has a small package of 2 servings of crackers. The package could even fit in you shirt pocket of a t-shirt. Another convenience is when you open this package you will most likely eats them before they get stale which may not always be the case in the large packaging depending on your families size.<br /><br />The down size is if you are looking for something for your child's lunchbox each package is two serving sizes. The package is 250 calories of which 50 calories is fat. So you would not be want to pack a full package. As for myself I found them just as tasty as I remember and a satisfying snack. This is old time favorite in a smaller wax paper package. 4.5 stars. TL;DR Convenient Packaging
"I have tried to imitate, not working... Please bring back the best Jerk since I left the islands!!!!!!!!!!!! TL;DR The Best!!!!!!!!"
"I can't find these in the store anymore, so it was great to find them online! They're quite tasty and the best mints I've had. TL;DR Excellent!"
"I keep this very handy, enjoy using it,<br />and will definitely get more.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026LNGTS"">Organic Ghee</a><br /><br />I will also get the ""Grass Fed Organic Ghee.""<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032RPLSY"">Grassfed Organic Ghee 7.8 Oz</a> TL;DR Very good!"
"This is the best jambalaya! I add in chicken, shrimp, sausage - whatever meat I have. I also add in frozen chopped spinach and frozen mixed veggies. I add some shredded cheese and sour cream so it is not so hot. My kids love it! And it is the only way I can get them to eat protein and veggies and dairy without them noticing they are eating it. I love it too! TL;DR Love, love, love this Jambalaya!!"
These little dessert cups were the hit of our dinner party.  They are versatile and can be used for drinks or food cups.  Everyone love them! TL;DR Great buy!
This is wonderful on scones!  Serve with a hot cup of black tea!  Spicy and smooth! TL;DR Wow!
Make sure to grind them in a coffee grinder just before you eat them. Only grind what you will eat since they go rancid very quickly. In order to get the benefits of the seed it must be ground or you will just pass them. TL;DR Good for Ya
"I was looking for a good, safe bone to give to my big chewer, my Bullmastiff. I was worried about some of the bad reviews, but decided to give it a go. She has been chewing on it almost nonstop for 3 weeks (we take it away from her when it goes pink, or if we aren't around), and is finally at the end of it. She chews it with gusto, it keeps her busy, and she cant tear large chunks off of it tht might hurt her. I'm ready to order another one! I'm very pleased. TL;DR Wonderful!"
"While trying to cut back on carbs, and add more protein to my diet, I discovered this wonderful tasty snack.  At 260 calories, even this 1.5 oz pack is too much for a snack, but I divide the packs in half again and have a healthy snack that helps satisfy my hunger in the late afternoon.  They're also good as a breakfast on the run. The wasabi adds a wonderful punch-love them! TL;DR Healthy, satisfying snack on the go"
I had not ordered from your store before and was not sure but am very pleased..I am almost ready to order again.. TL;DR Delicious Nuts
"Before I bought this sprouter, I used a jar with a screen lid on it and had failure after failure. I don't know what I was doing wrong, but it seemed like I never could get those alfalfa sprouts to ""sprout maturity""! Since I got this baby, I am the green queen of sprouting! (at least I feel like it...)I was a little concerned about the plastic stuff, but it seems very stable and does not impart any plastic ""flavor"" to the greens. I am so pumped that I am moving on to other sproutables. It is very easy to use, and I rinse once in the morning and once before I go to bed. That seems to be enough, but you can rinse more often. I have good water (no chlorine or fluoride) and with this tray my sprouts grow, grow, grow!<br /><br />When I'm ready to harvest them, the ""mat"" they form is easy to sort of peel up. I put them in a large salad spinner and fill it with water and sort of loosen them up, freeing the hulls to float on the top. Then I get a small strainer (everyone has one of those, right?) and put it over the kitchen sink drain and pour out the water into the strainer. That's where the hulls go (then into the compost bin) instead of down the drain! Then, I whir the salad spinner and get the sprouts ""dry"" and in they go to a container in the fridge with the lid cracked--so they can ""breathe"" a little bit.<br /><br />I have been doing this since I started growing with this sprouter. I understand you can actually stack these to grow more, but I will have to wait a bit before I become that adventurous.<br /><br />Oh, yeah, one more thing....After you soak the seeds for 6 or more hours (directions come with the sprouter or you can go to their website) and have them in the sprouter, I adjust the lid so it's open about an inch. Gives them room to breathe.<br /><br />Get it! Your body will thank you for growing LIVE food for it! Be good to yourself and discover sprouting---so much CHEAPER than the stores!! TL;DR I'm a SPROUTER!"
"Something just didnt taste right about this oatmeal.  Maybe I am just spoiled by my quaker. lol  Anyway, I gave it away. TL;DR Didn't really care for it."
FAST SHIPPER!! ALL 264 COUNT THERE!! GREAT PICK ME UP PRODUCT = 2 CUPS OF JAVA!! GREAT FOR A HOT AFTERNOON WHEN ICE COFFEE NOT AVALIABLE!! TL;DR GREAT!
"I was very excited when I read reviews about the product. I read about the product with an expiration code of March 2013 will be BPA free.I waited for a while to order this product for that reason.<br /><br />All cans I received were ""Expired January 2013"", and yes, it is BPA liner in.<br /><br />Maybe the Amazon warehouse had a lot of stock of the products, but I could not believe the canned food I received has expire date within 6 months. TL;DR Not very happy this time."
"Eden Organic makes amazing products, including beans in BPA-free cans.  They're careful with their sources and with their packaging, so I don't mind paying a little extra for products that I trust.<br /><br />But the price still seemed like a lot to me for beans, so I went to my local food coop to see what they charged for organic beans.  It was the same price per pound for loose organic red beans, and that was the only kind of organic beans they had.<br /><br />The beans themselves are good quality and cook up deliciously. TL;DR Great Beans Great Price"
"Anyone on (or ever been on) a diet knows Peanut Butter is a big no-no because of the fat/calories.  This stuff is the perfect answer to all your dreams!  You can mix it with as little/much water as you want so you get the consistency you like and use it on anything!  It basically tastes exactly like peanut butter, just without the sugar - so if it's not sweet enough for you, you can add in a packet of splenda.  It's great! TL;DR A dieter's dream!"
"This is one of the best dog food's I have gotten yet.<br />My dog likes it and it is good for him.My Vet. said it is good brand also. Cost a little more,but if I eat the best why shouldn't my dog??? TL;DR Good Chow"
I love a strong tea in the morning and this is my favorite.  It has a great deep flavor without being bitter. TL;DR tea lovers choice
"I bought these in an attempt to have a more Mediterranean-esque diet.  Simply put, I love these and so do all the people I've given bags to.  The flavor is divine and the packaging is perfect.  I ordered the case, which has 12 of the green boxes you see.  Inside each box is 6 or so individually wrapped packages of several grissini breadsticks (approximately 7.)  They're perfect for snacking, they are actually good for you, low in calories, have a bit of fiber and protein. All in all, a very good purchase. TL;DR perfect for snacking"
"Este condimento te saca de apuros y es muy bueno porque realmente es ajo deshidratado no es polvo, las alitas de pollo con esto y salsa barbacue quedan excelentes! igual que el pollo a la parrilla! TL;DR Excelente producto!"
This is the best iced tea and you will never be able to go back to grocery store brands after trying it.  My personal favorites are the mango and Passion fruit flavors.  The are so good naturally that no sugar or lemon is required.  Fiesta Fria is the flavor carried by the PF Chang restaurants and is very good also.  I am addicted to this iced tea and highly recommend it! TL;DR China Mist is the best iced tea!
"My mom likes these chocolates, so I thought I would buy for her for Christmas.  She was amazed at how big it was, and was able to share with the other families at the gathering.  I would recommend these. TL;DR Perfect Gift"
We have tried most of the Virginia peanuts out there and my wife and I agree that these are the best available. They are a perfect match of crunchiness and salt and it's hard not to eat just a handful of them. They're great when watching any type of sports or at any kind of party. You won't be disappointed! TL;DR Best Nuts Ever!
"I love these, my kids love these! Even my most picky eater loves them and they are healthy! Will definitely be getting more! Great for school lunches or snacks on the go! TL;DR Yummy & Healthy!"
"I first tried the Chamomile Citrus and then I decided to buy the variety pack to try other flavors. I loved the Organic mint and the ginger one, but that was about it. I guess I would just be careful next time because you might get stuck with teas that you don't like.. TL;DR Great tea, careful with the variety pack"
"I received the item within 36 hours of placing the order and saw no problems with the dry ice or the packaging. The package was s snug fit and the food items were in perfect condition. Above all else, the food was good to taste!<br />This is perhaps one of the tastiest and most value-for-money deals on Amazon or anywhere else, for that matter, as far as frozen food is concerned. I am definitely planning to get more of these in the future. So, if you are in the mood for some Indian style chicken dish, this is definitely worth a try. TL;DR Good Food and Perfect Customer Service"
"I figured this price (11.99) was too good to be true for a set of five but I ordered it anyway. I opened the box and only found one. At the time this product (identical description and link) was sold by ""Trend Marketing"" with prime shipping. I emailed Amazon to get the remaining four and they said they couldn't because they don't know or control the inventory for Trend. They refunded the full amount and didn't need me to return the single bottle. So it was free. Not a good deal if you need five but a great deal for the one.<br /><br />I just went to reorder in the hopes I would actually get five now. Though the description is the same it no longer has prime shipping and is decidedly not worth $7 shipping if I only get one bottle. TL;DR Bought 5, received 1"
"You probably already know whether or not you like this cereal.  If you've really never had Raisin Bran Crunch then: (a) it is bran flakes + raisins + little honey oat granola clusters, (b) it is less sweet than many mainstream cereals, but still far too sweet IMO, (c) it is reasonably healthy, but you could do a lot better. TL;DR it's raisin bran..."
"taste and smell is not even close as coffee, Herbal coffee? Should be herbal te!!! if you like coffee taste don't buy this product!!!! TL;DR doesn't smell or taste like coffee"
"I take a spoonful of Coconut Manna every day. This is a blend of coconut oil and the coconut meat and it tastes sweet and yummy. Very good antifungal and a healthy oil for heart, brain, hair, joints. I use regular coconut oil for cooking. Some people complain about it separating, which is true, but I use a fork and rake it from the glass to the middle. Then it is easy to take a spoonful. You could gently heat it (in a pot of hot water) and then mix it up but I never heat it. I prefer the glass jar to the newer plastic they are using, but I am happy it is Organic. TL;DR Delicious and Healthy"
I was looking for a low calorie cocoa and found this - Amazon has everything doesn't it?  It is wonderful and you don't have to use as much cocoa as it says.  I also make a power smoothie and put some of this in it.  Yum!! TL;DR Great find!
"I purchased one of these hoofers at my local PetCo and my small (16lb) dog loves it. The picture doesn't show it that well, but is is the whole hoof of a bovine, the toes with the bones and meat and skin all there. It is dried and not cured, which I am really pleased with.<br /><br />It doesn't smell bad like sometimes just the clipped hoof can, and infact even when my dog has been chewing on it for a long time I don't notice it being smelly. I've had rawhides after being chewed smell pretty bad from the curing chemicals but this hoofer doesn't smell gross. Even though it has more stuff in it than just a rawhide it doesn't get super stinky, a big plus for our apartment since we can't leave chews outside.<br /><br />Over all I recommend this hoofer as a good alternative to rawhides. If you have a big dog you may want to monitor them since it does have the toe bones inside and they are small. TL;DR Good Chew"
Was not sure what to expect when ordering and was pleasantly surprised. The texture mixed well with milk keeping a nice crunch. The taste was not over bearing within any of the flavors but a nice mixture of flavors. Was saddened when I came to the end of the box. Would order again. TL;DR Nice taste fulfilling
"My shar-pei has always had a sensitive stomach. From puppyhood, I've learned to be careful what I feed him.  When he reached his golden years (I'd say around nine years old), he seemed to have additional issues (like allergies) that just aggravated his sensitive stomach and I felt like I was back to the drawing board in attempting to find something that would suit him.<br /><br />I've tried cooking for him, prescription foods that I can only order from the vet, steroid shots once a month.  It got to be a pretty expensive endeavor and all the while, my dog was losing weight. Then, I had the fantastic luck of meeting a woman who told me about this food and I slowly replaced my shar-pei's dry prescription food with this. In addition, I've started supplementing his food with some oats mixed with pumpkin. And voila!<br /><br />On my last vet appointment, he claimed that he's never seen my dog look so healthy and that he had been honestly afraid that my dog was at death's door on our previous visit. No more steroid shots.  No more diarrhea. Now, I never did the allergy test on my dog to figure out what it was that I had to avoid, but all I can say is...it's not in this food. My dog is doing way better in this food than the uber expensive prescription food I used to give him. And Amazon's subscribe and save make it the cheapest place to get this once a month :) TL;DR Life and Money Saver!"
"I really have a terrible addiction, if I bring a can/jar or bag of nuts home, they get eaten as quickly as I can consume them. I've tried a lot of different flavors of all kinds of nuts and even make my own spicy sweet pecans..but I'm not really much of a peanut fan. So, when I tell you these are some of the most delicious peanuts or really one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten...well, give them a try. I HIGHLY recommend them. HIGHLY...I want some right now. These are salty, sweet, spicy and crunchy...did I mention I want some right now. Try them, you won't be disappointed. :) TL;DR 10 stars...from a nut addict"
"These are pretty good size pieces and are very hard and do not become soft like a lot of similar items.  They taste decent have a mild banana flavor.  This product requires your child to have some molars to be able to chew these up, my 18 month old has some trouble with them and prefers other things much more. TL;DR Ok for toddlers, but not for infants"
"Teh flowers were beautiful and last well. They arrived on time,and I would order them again and I would recommend the flowers to anyone. TL;DR Natures Best Bouquet"
We received our case of Good Season Caesar Dressing.  It is very good on chicken etc - just sprinkle some on as you are cooking.  Also good for roast beef in a crock pot.  I use it as a spice. TL;DR Caesar Dressing Review
"I remember being 10 years old and having these bad boys in my pocket. I would walk down to the corner store and pick some up, it was a very proud memory of mine that has been crushed by the present day purchase of this box. These sticks are only good enough for sidewalk chalk. They may not cause cancer, but it sure feels like it because they taste like they're 20 years old. TL;DR Nostalgia doesn't taste good."
"What can I say ... I opened this bag thinking I would just have a little taste and then put it in the pantry. I was wrong.<br /><br />This bag of goodness doesn't taste too much of cinnamon--it has a good, even mix of flavors that blend well on the tongue. I loved the addition of flax seeds--very good for the cholesterol levels. The contents stay nice and crunchy in the bag, and you can seal it ...<br /><br />if you don't finish that bag off first. TL;DR Delicious!"
"This was the best ginger I have purchased, ever. Not so knotty that I couldn't do much with. I usually make a lot of ginger yea. Works great. TL;DR Better than what I find in the stores"
"This stuff is so good it puts ""regular"" cornbread mixes to shame!  Even if we ever stop eating gluten-free, we'll continue to use this mix - it's that good!  I used it to try to duplicate my mother-in-laws cornbread dressing at Thanksgiving and it was amazing! TL;DR Wow!"
"Good fragrance and taste - great in cooking - and a drop or two in a paint can makes your walls smell great, too! TL;DR great vanilla"
Mocha Java is almost as good as going to Starbucks for a cup of coffee.  I recommend it to anyone who likes the Mocha flavor of coffee TL;DR one of the best
"Very good tasting coffee.  I recommend it for the people who like to drink best coffee!!<br />With milk, express coffee, american coffee, whichever you like. TL;DR Kimbo Coffee"
Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style. HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else. TL;DR Great but....
My 2 1/2 year old has a peanut allergy yet my 5 year old loves peanut butter. We're so happy to have found these as they both like them and my daughter feels like she gets to eat something her big brother can. I've been known to munch on them too ;) I love that they're super crunchy and stay crunchy even after opening. I wish they came in a bigger size. TL;DR Love the Sunflower Butter
It's the same taste as the one I bought in Asian supermarket which can recall me the Chinese style noodles. Very delicious! TL;DR Delicious Noodles
I first had these in Germany several years ago and they are so creamy and good that I was happy to find a source in the US.  They are wonderful. TL;DR Sylva
"This is excellent jerky.  I could eat the whole bag in one setting.  If you have had the good trade show quality jerky and are looking for something like that look no further this is it.  Buy a few bags, kick back, and enjoy your dancing taste buds..... TL;DR If you like jerky this is it!"
"I previously tried the Margharita version of this product, and I wanted to try another flavor. This is also a great low-calorie, non-carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage. After going thru bariatric surgery, this product was a great find.. It sparks up a hum-drum beverage world. Salute' TL;DR This is also a great low-calorie, non-carbonated, non-alcoholic beverage."
"This is the best and most fabulous gum in the world. Let's put it this way...if I got paid in gum, I'd definitely want to be paid in strawberry trident layers. TL;DR Yum Yum"
"Mostly bought this tea assortment for the Chocolate Mint flavor, which has been disappointing. Has a fake chocolate taste. The only other flavors I've tried are Coconut Mango and White Peach. The White Peach is very good, while Coconut Mango is okay. I hope the other 3 flavors are better, otherwise I would say this 6-pack is a waste, which is a shame because I normally enjoy Stash teas. TL;DR Tea is so-so"
"Essential water, seem to taste fine however the price was way too high for my budget. I suppose it may do well in the body but I couldn't tell a difference.. Heavy  exercisers and hard workers outdoors may get some relief from this  just type of product, but I'm neither, so I'll stick to my plane drinking. If you are electrolyte deficiency then ask your doctor and have him or her prescribe something like this for you.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful. TL;DR Just expensive water"
Can't beat this for an afternoon pick me up - refreshing and caffeine - really what more could you ask for? TL;DR Raspberry Riot
"Decided to try these after seeing a large display at a neighborhood food store.  After viewing the farmtt.com website, I was disappointed to learn that the peas were dried and processed, and that they use GMO corn oil.  Oh well, my search for a healthy potato chip substitute will continue.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FMZO8G"">Calbee Snack Salad Snapea Crisps, Original Flavor, 3.3- Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> TL;DR Lose the GMO corn oil"
"This tea is not pleasant to drink. It has a bitter lemon taste that lingers in your mouth. Very dissapointed. Amazon WILL NOT take returns on Grocery items so please DO NOT BUY this item. EWWWW, YUCK. TL;DR Horrible bitter and lemon taste. I recommend Diet Gold Peak Tea instead"
"These were pretty tasty! They dont stick in your teeth like other fruit snacks which is a HUGE plus, but even better they're all natural and good for you. I'll buy them again for sure. Soon-- when this box runs out. TL;DR tasty!"
"I love Meyenberg's fresh goat milk, but this canned milk has a bit of a goaty taste--still it's ok. Raw goat's milk where the nannies have been separated from the billies tastes better than cow's milk! TL;DR Goat Milk"
"My daughter and I shared the ""tins"" of these.  We both like them, very refreshing!  Would buy again if I get in the minty mood. TL;DR I liked them"
"My family is very picky on the flavor of French Vanilla Cappuccino they will drink.<br />We have tried and thrown away many gas station drinks when we couldn't find an Exxon on the run.<br />Yes, it must be an On the Run store and nothing else.<br /><br />All the others use a different version and/or brand.<br />If you like Exxon On the Run then this is the matching drink.<br />I saw the package one day while at the store and this matches.<br />BTW... ours is closing so now I'm on my second case.<br /><br />The flavor is great.<br />We use 3 tablespoons per 8oz which is much more than it calls for. TL;DR Perfect taste"
"This product is delicious. It has a very unique taste and is great by itself or in other things like baked goods. It has a beautiful orange-gold color. I also use it in some beer recipes that I brew. The can is also lovely, but once I open it, I store the syrup in a glass jar. TL;DR Delicious"
Very nice looking salt. DOnt know if the healing has begone but we love it & use it everyday! As per Dr OZ! TL;DR salty and pretty
"This is a great seasoning.  My dad taught me how to cook and our favorite basic spice combination for meat, fish and poultry is salt pepper and paprika.  Decided to eliminate salt from my diet and tried a some supermarket brands that were not great.  Kept looking and saw a spot for this at Costco but it is always empty.<br /><br />Instead of waiting I got it here on Amazon and have been using it for a few days.  This is great.  The closest to salt(I can't taste the difference) but the mix of flavors actually work better with meat, poultry and fish.<br /><br />My only concern was using it in soups but I ground it up and it was perfect in my favorite summer soup (corn chowder with crab/shrimp).  I love it.<br /><br />Ingredients(from the back of the bottle):<br /><br />Organic onion, organic garlic, organic carrot, organic black pepper, organic red bell pepper, organic tomato granules, organic orange peel, organic parsley organic bay leaves, organic thyme, organic basil, organic celery, organic lemon peel, organic oregano, organic savory, organic mustard seed, organic cumin, Organic marjoram, organic coriander, organic cayenne pepper, citric acid and organic rosemary.<br /><br />I love this and it is a great salt replacement. TL;DR A cooks dream if you want to reduce sodium."
"I am not really sure why it is so difficult to find decent chili in the Southeast. I saw that this was made by the Birds Eye folks so I thought I would give it a try. Definitely the best mild chili I have had from a can. They make several varieties so if you like it spicy, they can do that too. This was my second order and I will be doing it on a regular basis. TL;DR Best of the West in the East!"
"I couldn't tell if these were tomatoes or strawberries, so I ordered Just Tomatoes Just Strawberries, 4-Ounce Tub, and I'm not sure what I got.  Whatever they are, there's none of that sweet juicy fruity goodness you find in both strawberries and tomatoes.  They should call these...Just Something Dried Up That Just Used to be Fruit or something like that. TL;DR Tomato or Strawberry?"
"This is our favorite Starbucks flavor.  So the flavor gets 5 stars but the Amazon price of over $27 for 36 ounces is terrible.  BJs sells a whole bean bag (40 ounces) for $21.29. TL;DR Rating for Amazon price, not the coffee"
I was given a variety pack that contained the Tully's Kona Blend K-cups.  I found them to be the best by far so when it came time to buy some more K-cups it was an easy decision. TL;DR perfect flavor and strength
"Round and hard is not the same as square and flakey.  I can see changing over to sea salt, no big deal... but the new texture of the round crackers is not even close to the Original.  I'll be looking for a new brand to purchase for my next 50 years. TL;DR No Longer Original Premium Saltines"
"I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.<br /><br />She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.<br /><br />I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up. TL;DR Don't hold Dog's attention, Gas"
"My last Pit Bull and the one I have now had THE worst gas - and frequently!  Tried this (& the venison meal version in the lavender bag) & the gas has been all but totally stopped.  Makes us all happy and it must feel better to her, too! TL;DR Great for Pit Bulls - almost totally eliminates gas!"
"These noodles did not cure my cataracts, nor did they clear up my cousin Ned's mysterious rash he got while visiting the Philippines. I cooked two of the six packages up and tried to feed them to the gimp rooster and the mangy-lookin' goose, but they just rooted around looking for the dried peas like in the noodle cups. Next day, yep: rooster still walkin' cockeyed and goose still looking like a beat up dirty pillow at the dump. I'd say these ""miracle"" noodles are no different than snake oil and a gypsy fortune. Miracle angel hair...hmph...my left toe! But they taste alright with soy sauce! TL;DR Stick to Modern Medicine"
"Lets be clear delivery of product was great, product looked good.<br /><br />I thought I loved these lemon crisps, and feeling homesick for Aus I purchased them. The lemony filling delightful but I had forgotten about the outside biscuits being salty.  Oh well.  Still love Arnotts, maybe its time for a Tim Tam instead. TL;DR Memories not true as reality."
"Let me put it this way: I do not have the most discriminating taste buds in the world.  I dated a woman who would take a bite of butter and say ""Num, this is good, the cows ate flowers on the north side of the barn"".  This was especially remarkable since we had zero idea where the tasty butter had come from.  I on the other hand would announce, ""Good butter.  Very solid.  No mold.""  This does save me a lot of money.  Bottles of wine over $20 bucks are all wasted on me because I cannot pick out the toasted essence of pergola or whatever.  If it doesn't have chunks, I'm good to go.  In other words, my palate responds clumsily to food nuance.  Don't get me wrong, this doesn't keep me from loving to eat.  It just makes it a little less flattering when I tell the cook ""Gosh that was delicious!""  They look at me like they just got a compliment from a Labrador.<br /><br />Anyway, I preface this review with those personal insights to say ""Yes, real Celtic Sea Salt is really good!""  I can taste the difference.  It's that significantly better than standard table salt or even other supposed sea salts (sorry, just because it's big lumps of salt doesn't make it any more authentic).<br /><br />The taste of Celtic Salt is a symphony, compared with table salt, which is like your nephew playing the plastic recorder.  It's just that much richer of an experience.  The first thing I noticed is that it didn't have that sharp one-note taste of table salt that anesthetizes your tongue.<br /><br />So basically I'm saying if I think it's great, you'll probably think it's really great! TL;DR Even loved by food clods!"
"Finally, a gluten free chip that tastes great! It is light and flavorful. I will certainly be ordering more soon! TL;DR Great Taste & Gluten Free"
"I wanted to surprise my mom for her birthday and I was a little hesitant about buying flowers online. It was definitely a great choice! My mom loved them. The flowers came on the exact date I wanted them delivered.  Most of the flowers were blossoming and lively, there were some that were limp, but I am not sure if they were dead. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars was because I knew the flowers would not look exactly like the picture, but they were not as colorful as I hoped. In the picture, they have several different colors of roses, but in my bouquet there were only white and red with orange tips roses. Also, I dont think I received as many flowers as it was depicted in the picture. Overall, I was very pleased with the order and delivery speed. I will certainly be ordering more flowers online, but if I decide to purchase the same type, I would probably go with the the regular smiles and sunshine over the deluxe. TL;DR Right on time!"
"I have been using Breathies for my dog for years and this is the first time I was disappointed with the product. When I opened the bag I thought they seemed harder than usual. The packaging states ""best before 03/23/2012"" and these were ordered on April 29th. I believe this is the first time I ordered from this particular vendor (Happy Dog Place, INC) and am disappointed that this happened. TL;DR product was stale and past expiration date"
This product arrived very promptly and earlier than the expect date. I like dealing with companies like this...!!! 5 stars!!!! TL;DR Great Seller...!!!!!
"Is it rice?  of course not, or it would be full of carbs, but it sure is a great low carb substitute!  It was so nice to have a meal that was more than meat.  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and rinsed in a wire mesh strainer for several minutes. While it rinsed I browned some ground beef, drained fat, and added the ""rice"". Let it fry a minute or two and stirred in a heaping tablespoon of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E5IC3E"">Goya Sofrito Tomato Cooking Base Sauce 12 Ounces (1 unit)</a>  with a can of drained chopped tomatoes. Then I cooked a few minutes stiring often.  I made sure to let it sit about 5 minutes before serving to allow flavor to absorb.  It was wonderful! My family wanted my dish instead of the real stuff I cooked them. TL;DR Finally found something low carb to use as rice"
Packaging was great and arrived on time. I thought it was a little Pricey but the part that ruined it for me was how sweet it was. It tastes more like a milk shake than coffee. TL;DR way too sweet
"1980's is grammatically incorrect. It should be 1980s. No apostrophe. The only time you would use that is if you are shortening it by decade i.e. '50s, '60s, '70s. It may sound trivial but seriously I can't buy the candy because of it. TL;DR Grammer"
"Very fast delivery and very pleased with product.  Like the idea of anchovies in jar, makes keeping them easier, though they get eaten quickly.  Will order again soon. TL;DR Great Anchovies"
"I needed a big lot of storage bags since I have plenty of breastmilk to store everyday. I found this deal (vs Lansinoh which I used before this one and Medela which I never used because it's expensive), which seemed very good. Size-wise, they are a bit smaller than Lansinoh. I fill up a bag before storing in the freezer and Lansinoh's can hold about 15oz while this one holds only 13oz and I often have 15oz to put away so I always have to leave 2oz in the bottle to store in the fridge. However, I like that the volume labels are more accurate than Lansinoh. I have used about 3 packs (out of 12) and 3 have leaked on me (two were already frozen and when I thawed them, I saw the milk disperse in the water so I had to dump 15oz of milk each bag!). The other one leaked right after I poured my pumped milk and sealed it. I still give it 4 stars because overall these take care of my needs. TL;DR Good for the Price"
"The only way I can compare this body wash is with another Dove product: the Exfoliating Body Wash. They are both great and refreshing. It's amazing how this brand of the British-Dutch multinational corporation, Unilever, makes such a positive gentle impact on how we start a day. TL;DR Amazing Product!"
These chocolate twists are YUMMIE!  I love them.  This is also the best deal I have been able to find on them at $11.03 and for 6 12 oz packages?  WOW!!  If you love chocolate these are great!<br /><br />One thing...they aren't fat free...  :(  They have 1 gram (5% of your daily) saturated fat in 4  pieces.  I dare you to try to eat just 4 of these in one day. TL;DR These things are my weakness!!
"I heard of this flavor and was happy to find them here. I was excited to try them. Maybe it was the hype, maybe I expected too much from the Spam flavor, but they fell short of expectations. They're not bad, but you'd probably never guess they're spam flavored. They tasted like roasted macadamia nuts, salted with a hint of smokiness. Maybe the flavor would be more pronounced if I ate more than a couple at a time. I would buy these again, maybe for a holiday basket for the spam lovers in my life, more for the novelty rather than the actual taste. TL;DR Not bad, I'd buy them again"
"I have made these several times now.  First two boxes were made using extra virgin light oilve oil since that is what I had, no butter.  I baked them in a glass dish and then in a round metal cake pan.  I had to bake them for almost 22-25 minutes both times.  Both came out like chocolate cake.  Great tasting but not the texture I was looking for. Next time I used the butter and made them in my aluminum round cake pan.  Better with the butter versus the oil.  Still really cake like and I only baked them that time for 20 minutes.  Today I used the same metal pan, butter and only baked them for 17 minutes.  They cooled for several hours before we ate some.  Almost perfect!  I think I might add 1 more minute next time to get a little more firmness in the middle.  I think the problem is that the center totally jiggles when you take them out at 16 or 17 minutes.  I thought they were not done on my prior attempts.  I figured since they had no egg I would go for it at that time and am glad I did.  You must let them cool I think cause they would be too gooey if you ate them warm.  The edges were cake like but the center was fudge ""y"".  Let's just say I will be making these many times!  I am set up on the subscribe option.  I do add nuts too.  Thanks for the peanut free goodness!  We also love the pancake mix too. TL;DR WOW!  Super easy and tastes great!"
"Okay, here's the deal.  I make salad dressing from scratch.  I get out a nice, green fruity extra virgin olive oil and spices and some decent white or red wine vinegar, and make something entirely superior to, while still generally cheaper than, those supermarket blends of indifferent grade spices and chemical thickeners, swimming in mostly-canola oil.<br /><br />And why the heck am I talking salad dressing in a coffee review?<br /><br />I make coffee, I tend towards the similarly purist.  Whole bean.  You can get a basic grinder model for the price of a pound or two of the beans, and pre-ground is pre-staled, under the best of circumstances.  As for flavoring?  Flavoring is something I've long believed was invented by coffee brokers to get the lower grade stuff off their shelves.  And those flavors are generally lab-created, both for economy and for more precise/consistent control of the product.<br /><br />So I obviously come to this coffee with my biases, but I also love Starbucks coffees, bought whole from a Starbucks storefront.  I do notice a quality difference right away with the supermarket blends - I think in their own stores, the beans just turn over faster.<br /><br />Yet, as it happens, Starbucks Natural Fusion Vanilla coffee has (for me) a few advantages - chiefly, natural flavoring.  In this case, vanilla, and sasparilla, long a favorite ingredient of old-fashioned carbonated beverages.<br /><br />Brewed my first cup in my coffee maker.  And I hated it.  Very odd, unpleasant, cloying, bad, chemical taste.  Any vanilla taste or aroma, stayed behind in the bag.  Now, other reviewers clearly, have loved it.  Did I get a bad batch?  (This happens.  What one reviewer says about one bag has to be taken as one data point only.)<br /><br />Unwilling to give up on a perfectly, well, full bag, I decided to try cold brewing.  You can buy a fancy appliance (Amazon here carries no less than 4 systems for the purpose), or you can acquire a largish (6"" or so) fine mesh strainer and a quart jar.  Stir together ½ lb of ground coffee with 4.5 cups cold water, and refrigerate overnight.  Strain the next day, and the resulting concentrate stays fresh tasting for a week or 2.  You'll need to add water in a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 ratio, with the ""1"" being the concentrate.<br /><br />The cold brewing technique has its pros and cons.  Pro:  it's really convenient to make a week's worth of concentrate, as most of the ""work"" is just giving it the time to steep.  For the acid sensitive or just those who just prefer a smoother brew, it is a miracle.  But for the ""Con"": the real nuance and complexity of some of the best coffees comes along with the coffee oils that release under HEAT, and I do notice some flavor loss with some of my favorite coffees, cold brewed.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla was made for cold brewing.  The delicate essence of non-lab created flavors held up much better un-""cooked"".  I tasted vanilla, and yes, even the sasparilla, which people tend to know from Root Beer.  The off notes were still there in the background but more carbonated-soda reminiscent than they were harsh or offensive.  And yes, this is darning with faint praise, but...<br /><br />I'd buy this.  If I had a group to caffeinate for a hot summer event, and minimal time to futz with grinders or syrups or vanilla beans or cooling and icing hot coffee, this would be the trick.<br /><br />For home use...sorry.  Whole beans.  An extra 30 seconds of effort for 10 times more taste, and maybe a dollop of the Torani syrup, if my heart is set on flavoring.<br /><br />So, Starbucks, if you can ""infuse"" a whole bean with all natural flavors, I'd love to hear about it.  Maybe you could just sell the beans with a bottle of ground vanilla/cinnamon/nutmeg/whatever powder like you have in your stores - low tech, but lovely.  In the meantime, 3 stars for a catering/get-together blend that is admittedly worlds better than you average foodservice pre-ground.<br /><br />Just brew it cold. TL;DR Brew it cold!"
"Big train spiced chai is my favorite. Used by a local so cal coffee shop, even better made at home. Not to mention money saving vs how much the coffee shop charges. TL;DR Spiced chai"
"These were great - just as described. Used them for a bee-themed party, and now we use them as ""to go"" packs of honey for our coffee and tea. TL;DR Great little treats"
"This is an easy to prepare, unique tasting ice tea. I have used Crystal Light now for a few years and so I was curious how it would taste.  I was not disappointed.  The flavor is tangy and pleasant, very much like a Margarita. I always have 'Natural Lemon' and 'Iced Tea' at home and this was an interesting addition.  One small difference is, though, that while my usual flavors can be prepared in an old plastic bottle, this one should be prepared in a glass pitcher. The flavor was a bit off coming from out of the plastic bottle.  But other than that, a enjoyable experience. TL;DR Good tasting icetea"
"The sticker on the Green Mountain. K-cup box said: Dec Magic but it was placed over the real title of the box which was Our Blend.  When I opened the box it was not decaf but regular coffee: Our Blend.  As I am too busy to mess around with returning it, my husband will use it at work for the office.  Very disappointing experience with this vendor. No one could think this was the right product for the label unless they could not speak English! TL;DR Wrong product.  Ordered Dk. Magic Decaf.  Bad vendor."
"Too expensive for us to purchase at full price but got a great deal so bought two cases. Intended to use as baby food but our child wont eat purees very much so preschooler likes these in the car.<br /><br />While fresh fruit is best, these make a great substitute and are great in kitchen. Make an organic sauce for chicken. Put orange juice in pan (strong, closer to concentrate is best), add cinnamon, nutmeg, and a pouch of this puree. Another option is finely diced apples and applejuice. Makes a great, simple chutney. Just don't tell the family or your guests you served then ""baby food"" until after they rave about the meal! TL;DR not just baby food -great for quick use in kitchen"
I have rottweiler and he used eat just about anything. Now that he is older he seems to be a bit picky. I placed this food next to his regular food that I feed him and he chose this Chef Michael's food. This bag is not the cheapest but I get every once in a while to cycle their food. Great ingredients and I am sure the dog liked the taste of the food. TL;DR Dog loves it....
"This popcorn pops very large and is quite tasty.  If you like big fluffy popcorn than this is for you.  My machine also pops pretty much everyone one of the seeds for the most part.<br /><br />Also don't get confused at first like I did.  It's not Caramel flavored popcorn or anything like that.  I believe they are just talking about the type of kernel.  This pops like normal yellow popcorn and has no seasonings or added flavor.  So if you want big normal yellow popcorn, than this is right for you. TL;DR Great popcorn, don't be confused its not flavored popcorn."
"Easy to make (just like any tea) and has a nice smooth, relaxing chocolate taste. No sugar or milk needed but you can add it if you want it to me more hot cocoa-esque. I'm going to try adding some mint leaves and see what levels of joy will follow! TL;DR Great cocoa taste - no calories!"
"I love pumpkin spice coffee from Dunkin Donuts, but the DD brand is to expensive. I saw the reasonable price of Green Mountains Pumpkin coffee and decided to try it. It is fantastic! If you like pumpkin spice I would recommend this coffee. TL;DR Love Pumpkin"
"I begin my day with one cup of smooth move tea-- everyday.  If I forget I make sure that I take it before I go to bed at night. It taste good. My teenaged grandsons like it.<br /><br />It depends on how blocked you are which will determine how it works.  You may have to have two cups before it begins to work. However, make sure you do not have any place to go when you are trying it out for the first time.  Believe me it will work. Some people it takes time others it works right away. I use it once a day and it keeps me regular. It dosn't run because I know how to use it. I have been doing this for some time--for four years. I steep it for one minute if I kept it in for more than 1-5 minutes I would not be able to go out because it would run. My friend steeps it for 1/2 a minute that way she is able to go out. Give it five days before you give up on it. So good luck to you all. TL;DR I wouldn't miss a day."
"I was very happy when I received this kit. It comes with everything you need to start making sushi and is of very good quality. However, I wish that it would have included more recipes in the booklet and maybe some seasame seeds to go with it. (I can't find seasame seeds anywhere around these parts!) Overall, very pleased with this product. TL;DR Great Kit, Maybe more recipes?"
"I ordered the pear and the apple. The pear to me was ok, had an off taste but the apple is super! I am diabetic and was so happy to see a sparkling beverage that had no added sugar and seemed good quality.<br />At Easter I could join in with everyone in toasting and my glass was as fizzy and sparkling as the next. I felt special! If your diabetic you know how hard it is to find great products like this.<br />Only thing is I wish the company made ALL the flavors with a no added sugar version. I would buy every single one and try it! hint hint TL;DR Love this flavor and product"
"My husband always had sinus problems, but ever since he started drinking this sinus buster tea then it really helped and now he hardly has sinus problem anymore.  Highly recommended, drink it after dinner time will be the best suggestion.  Once or twice a day should be fine, put some honey and lemon to make better flavor. TL;DR you should try this tea.."
"When my friends recommended me to try some peanut butter & chocolate, I didn't know it would be this tasty. I ordered a pack (6 bottles), I thought I could eat for a long time. However, I find I really love them and in one week only, I eat the whole bottle. I always eat them with bread. Hope you like them. The only disadvantage of this product is that I don't think it is healthy because, you know, butter, chocolate...those kind of things. TL;DR It's awesome"
I like mushroom bread and adding for a special flavor to other bread. Arrowhead makes good stuff. TL;DR Arrowhead good stuff..!!
"...looks like 40 cents worth of cheap wire and a nickel in sheet metal. NO indication of where it was manufactured. Not a clue as to how to set it or deploy it. ""Easy Set"" my A$$. TL;DR no packaging, no instructions"
Wonderful product--my daughter has to eat gluten free and utilizes a bread machine at her college residence. Texture is great and MUCH more flavorful and moist than a store bought loaf.  Amazon's price is great compared to retail prices and convenient as well. TL;DR Pamela's Gluten Free Bread Mix
The company shipped promptly. The item was exactly what I wanted and I was very pleased. TL;DR purchase
I wish I had noticed the list of ingredients before I purchased this product. It is not just cheese. Read the ingredients. MSG is bad for you and there are about 15 ingredients besides the cheese. YUCK! I will throw them out. They don't taste that great either. TL;DR Not that great
"The Ground Flaxseed was received as ordered. No Issues.  Works well!  Tastes Good.  Will buy again.  Put two in freezer for use later.  Use in yogurt, oatmeal, pancakes and on cereal. TL;DR OK Product- Amazon Delivers Quality & Price/Value"
"PURCHASE OF CENTO TOMATO PUREE AND TOMATOES - 2 CASES<br /><br />We've used Cento puree and tomatoes many times so I thought this was a very good buy at the price offered.  Unfortunately, three fourths of the cans were dented and some of the rims at the top of the cans were crushed in making it difficult to open with a standard can opener.  Had we known that these were cast off dented cans, we probably would not have made the purchase. TL;DR Dented can review"
"My husband & I do not care for mushrooms so we use the cream of onion soup in place of mushroom soup in all dishes. Great flavor, not too strong, very tasty and I get many compliments for the dishes. Wish I could buy locally. TL;DR Great flavor"
"All Jittery Joe's Coffee is craft roasted fresh in Athens, GA by people who know their coffee.  Free Climb is a smooth and delicious blend that I can actually drink black, because there is no bitterness that often accompanies coffee.<br /><br />Another option from Jittery Joe's that is delicious is called Whoop-Ass in a Can; I have not seen it available through Amazon, but is available through [...].  In fact, this is one of the few times on Amazon where going to the source will actually save a buck or two.<br /><br />Support your small-town roaster in The Classic City of Athens, GA and buy Jittery Joe's Coffee! TL;DR Fresh From Athens, GA"
"These arrive in bud, I think one was opening and they smell so good!  They came with a vase.  did I mention they smell so good.  Ha Ha.  Quite lovely. TL;DR Fresh and lovely."
"Our dogs love this dried liver and it is hard to find, we were thrilled to find it and to buy enough to get it shipped for free. Can't say we have tried it as it is pet food but our dogs love it. TL;DR dogs love it"
"I have tried several different brands of pure maple syrup, but this one is my favorite.  It smells and tastes heavenly.  We don't use lots of it, but it keeps in the refrigerator for months. TL;DR Yummy"
"Bigelows only red tea (so far) is pear. The flavor is excellent, no caffeine, and its organic. The pear flavor is light and doesnt taste artificial (because its not). I have about 20 red teas that I drink regularly because it so low in tannins and doesnt aggravate my illness. Bigelows Asian Pear is one of my favorites. TL;DR Great Taste"
"This India Spice Chai while brewing fills the whole room with wonderful aromas of nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves almost like the Chinese 5 spice blend.  There is no added sugar or cream so if you want that go with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030GQHXA"">Cafe Escapes Chai Latte K-Cups for Keurig Coffee Machines - 16 Pack</a>.  Those k-cups which are delicious as well have the cream that many expect in a chai tea.  This particular brand of Celestial Seasonings is just tea.  You can add what you want after the fact.  I've not had any trouble with the packaging, nor having the tops flop off while brewing.  This is just a nice cup of spiced tea.  It's not peppery and won't offend or be too spicy for most. I really like it and highly recommend. TL;DR Delicious with 5 spice aromas, not full of sugar and cream"
I ordered the Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce through Amazon Vine.  We put the sauce on Taco Bell tacos and burritos.  I thought the sauce was good.  It tasted strong with a lot of spices.  It was thicker than the sauce in the restaurant.  It was thin but it must have many spices in it.  My wife thought it was ok but found it to have a smoky flavor.  I thought it was a tangy flavor.<br /><br />John Navarra TL;DR It's a good sauce!
"Being British by birth, we drink a lot of tea and I was very pleased to find that Amazon could supply PG Tips at a much better price than what I have to pay in my local grocery store. TL;DR Good price for PG Tips"
"These are just delicious! It's crunchy and full of flavor. Kind remembers what granola actually is. They go great in a bowl with milk, or even better on top of frozen (or not) yogurt. It's also great eaten out of hand, but has a slight cereal-out-of-the-box quality.<br /><br />I don't get punched in the face with vanilla, but the vanilla I do get feels more authentic than a lot of snack foods. It's not an artisinal creation, by any means, but this is a new type of off-the-shelf snack food that hearkens back to real food made by real people. The ingredients are down to earth and the flavors deliver on the promise. This is good munching. TL;DR Great on Frozen Yogurt"
"Start your day off right.  Cook some steel cut oats and amaranth (2:1) in unsweetened almond-flavored soy milk.  When almost finished stir in some dried blueberries.  When finished, sprinkle with truffle salt and pepitas.<br /><br />This is probably the most healthy and addictive breakfast you can eat.  I'm here because I'm almost out of truffle salt and I don't think I could bear to run out. TL;DR Truffles with breakfast."
"I have been taking this for over a year and for the first year in many, have escaped colds, flu, etc. I would not be without it. TL;DR Redmond Clay"
"Coffee is mild and mellow, I would call it Medium roast. Other thanthe cost of shipping a very good deal. My hopes are that they will continue to make them.  Now that Senseo has quit the pod business I hope some one jump in and provide  for us who won't pay for the overpriced K cups. TL;DR Good melow coffee"
"Reminder - 3 stars means ""it's okay"".  That being said, the most important question is how does it taste?  It definitely tastes like chocolate, that's for sure.  Each piece is a lightweight crunchy pillow much like Captain Crunch, filled with a tiny drop of chocolaty syrup. The pieces are very lighweight, mostly air, so a bowl of this cereal isn't very filling.<br /><br />Each box of cereal is only 11 ounces, one of the smallest boxes of cereal I've ever seen, and that combined with not being very filling means each box is only good for a few servings.<br /><br />But wait! All that would be okay except each box (when ordered from Amazon in a 4-pack) costs $5.00!!  There is no way this cereal is worth five bucks a box.  The front of the box is actually embossed, adding I'm sure to the price of the product.<br /><br />Cereal prices in supermarkets are too high, most people would agree, but for $5.00 one would generally get a box of cereal at least twice as big. I only buy cereal when it's on sale so I rarely pay more than $2 or $3 a box for brand names and often can get store brand for $1.50 a box.<br /><br />Krave tastes okay, better than Cocoa Puffs, isn't all that special, but not bad either. In this instance my 3-star review is based mostly on that, but the high price easily lost them a star. TL;DR Tasty but waaaay overpriced"
I ordered two boxes. Expiration date ws only 2 month left. My baby is 14 month now. I believe he can not finish it eventhough i feed him this as an main food. TL;DR Near Expriation date
All of the Happy Baby cereals are great and my grandson loves them!  Organic and good for babies! TL;DR perfect baby cereal
"These crackers are a wonderful compliment to wine and cheese.  Subtle flavor enhances, doesn't overpower, the main course.  I also love them if I'm not feeling well and need something subtle but filling to soothe my stomach.  Unbeatable price here. TL;DR the best crackers ever!"
I never recieved this item and they kept my money!!!!! i sent many emails none were returned!  i feel robbed!! TL;DR do not order this!
This new Kool-Aid flavor is awesome! Love the blend of Peach and Mango! It has a nice tropical flavor without being too sweet. My toddler and I both love it! TL;DR Love this new flavor!!
"Growing up in Southeast Asia, we had easy access to New Zealand's Anchor butter for everyday consumption. Moving to the States as an adult, I found the butters here tasteless. I thought it was just a change in my tastebuds, but when I was able to get Anchor butter again, I did a simple taste test and realized that the high quality flavour of the NZ butter was real!  I have tried all kinds of butter here - organic and not, even butters imported from France, Ireland, Germany, etc. Nothing - NOTHING - comes close to the fresh taste of New Zealand's Anchor Butter, which has hints of clover and something really special that's hard to describe!  The NZ government has very strict regulations for its cows and all, and these cows graze upon meadow grasses - you can taste it in the butter!<br /><br />So if you're reading this and getting curious - don't waste another second - order yourself some real Anchor Butter. You won't regret it, and you won't look back! TL;DR Only the Best Butter in the World - Anchor Butter from New Zealand!"
"Dark chocolate oatmeal that's healthy sounds like a great idea, right?  In theory yes.  But in practice, this product is just a disappointment.  It smelled gross cooking.  I took one bite when it was done, and then had to add like 6 teaspoons of sugar to it and a little milk.  And then I STILL couldn't eat it.  It is the worst oatmeal I have ever tasted.  Don't waste your money on this!<br /><br />I will admit however, that I liked the convenient way that you measure your water in the empty pouch.  That is all. TL;DR They are disgusting!"
Use to get product in Miami at Publix but it is not at the store in Jax so I was able together it on Amazon! TL;DR Makes for a great burger...
"I've looked and looked for a decent granola cereal, finally found it in this.  You actually feel full when you are done with a bowl, and the flavor and texture are perfect.  Highly recommended! TL;DR Great flavor, very filling"
"I love rye bread, so the rye Triscuits were wonderful. They cannot be found anywhere in the city I live, so I ordered a 12-pack on line, 1/2 for me, 1/2 for my friend in Houston who introduced me to them. I was really disappointed. The boxes I have opened are mostly pieces. They are still my favorite crackers, but I hate serving them like this.<br />They were mailed quickly to me and I appreciate that, but I wish they had been packed better. Thank you. TL;DR Triscuit Rye and Caraway Crackers"
I can't find this in stores glad to have it on line.  Sending some to Uganda for friends there so they can enjoy a good Southern meal. TL;DR Family Favorite Found
"Too much like those sausages you get in wine & cheese gift baskets......mystery meat, too many preservatives.....if you want a soft ""lunchmeat-type"" snack, buy these.  Otherwise, try something else. TL;DR Too ""Processed"""
"I have been buying this wonderful, traditional fruitcake from the Trappist Abbey for many years now. My family used to make a fantastic fruitcake until my grandmother, mother and aunts got too old to continue. The Trappist Abbey fruitcake comes the closest to the taste of my family's old recipe cake.<br /><br />I have served this fruitcake to guests who loved it. Even my son thinks it is wonderful and always looks forward to receiving one as a gift. I also have given it as a gift to friends who remember the old-fashioned fruitcakes.<br /><br />The Trappist Abbey is a dark, moist fruitcake stuffed with fruit and nuts. You can wrap it in cheesecloth and give it a drink of brandy, bourbon, or rum if you want, but that certainly is not a necessity.<br /><br />I recommend this brand wholeheartedly and I plan on sending in this year's order shortly. TL;DR Wonderful, old-fashioned dark fruitcake from Trappist Abbey"
I guess they have changed the way they send these since the last reviewer ordered them. They were packaged in a ways that would completely prevent spillage. The nuts taste fresh with no salt or preservatives. Good for a low stress diet and to improve serotonin levels. TL;DR Shipping Issue is Fixed
"The Good - Necco Wafers can get stale if they're in inventory for too long. These weren't. They were fresh and tasted great, if you love Necco Wafers, and I do.<br /><br />The Bad - Even though obvious effort had been made to pack them properly, the box was badly battered and the contents had shifted so that the wafers were not at all protected by the little air bags that probably had surrounded them when they were given over to the shippers. Thirty six rolls of wafers with, I'm guessing, at least 50 wafers per roll. That would be a minimum of 1800 wafers. All but, perhaps 50 wafers total were broken ... some just into two or three pieces, but many were smashed to granules. I actually had to put them into a bowl and eat them with a spoon.<br /><br />I really was disappointed. TL;DR The Good and the Bad"
"After drinking Twinings Green Tea for a while I decided to give the decaf a whirl. While Twinings have always pleased me with flavorful teas, I found this decaf to not be quite as good as regular Green Tea. Though some may not notice the difference, as it is slight, it is still quite good. TL;DR Good but not great"
Great variety for anyone wanted to test a lot of types of Timothy's coffee and teas. Very smooth and flavorful coffee. TL;DR Great Starter Pack for new Keurig Coffee Maker
"Switch Beverage company's Black Cherry juice drink does pack a pretty good cherry taste.  It is mildly carbonated and not too sour.  I found the thin 8 ounce can nice to look at and a good size to hold onto.  It states ""100% juice"" ""no sugar added"" and ""no preservatives.""  Don't let the no sugar added thing fool you, though.  It has 33 grams of sugar!  Not a low caloie drink either at 130 calories.  It does not have corn syrup or any artificial colors which is nice.<br /><br />It is pretty good, but I am not sure I would buy this all the time because of the hight sugar content and the calories.  Plus, after a few sips I start really tasting the grape juice in this (#2 juice after apple on the ingredients list). TL;DR High sugar black cherry drink"
"To some extent, soap is soap, whatever the form.  What makes this Dove Body Wash better or worse than similar products?<br /><br />It gets you clean:  that's good.  On the other hand, there's nothing exceptional about the job it does.  In addition, if you are particularly sensitive to smell, the fragrance may be a bit much.<br /><br />What I dislike about this product is the package.  Personally, I prefer to have the bottle dispense from the top, and while most containers can work with either side up, this one requires a bit of a balancing act if you want the dispenser at the top.  What annoys me more, however, is the opaqueness of the container, which makes it harder to determine how much body wash you have left.<br /><br />Overall, this is an okay product, but not one I'd go out of my way to get. TL;DR It gets you clean"
Tastes good but not worth the price.  Over a dollar is a lot to pay for one cup of Chai that I make at home.  I will try to find this another place or find a less expensive brand. TL;DR too expensive
"At first I thought that ordering Gyro sauce over the internet was kind of wierd, but it turned out the be pretty good. It came when they said it would, and it came cold with ice packs. The taste was a little more on the pickled side, but i used it with pizza when i ran out of ranch dressing. TL;DR Gyro Sauce"
"Hi I'm Tammie I live in Abita Springs, Louisiana about 45 miles from New Orleans, Louisiana I dranked Cumminty coffe since I was a little girl when my dad and mom would say Tammie go get me a cup a coffee or go make a pot of coffee. Well every morning since I half to have a coffee maker with a timer so I can have a cup of coffee first thing when I wake up. The parenting experts say children should'nt have coffee, Well their wrong my children 1 girl and 2 boys would wake up every morning to a cup of coffee at breakfast. It would move their bowels before school. When they wouls get to school they would have no need to half to use the bathroom at school. Also it gives them that little pep they need to get a great start for school. Well recently my husband retired after 30 years on the New Orleans Port as a Long shorman at the age of 49. When or little girl Kimberly 12 years old passed from Pro Long QT Syndrome the doctors mis diagnosed her with Epilespy. On June 29th 2007. We drink alot of coffee up to 3 pots a day. We had to cut back on the cost of everything we consumed so he bought Folgers another New Orleans coffee brand, Well it's so nasty to where I could'nt drink it no more. He tried Rouses brand, walmart brand, and others that was cheaper, then found out there's toxins in some of the cheaper brands. Well finally he bought Maxwell House well it was better than the others. But I really wanted my Cummunity New Orleans Chickory Blend coffee. So I'm addicted to Amazon so bad it's to where I have so many others getting addicted to Amazon also. My children included they love and enjoy amazon to. they like their wish list I set up for them. I found the site about Cummunity Coffee I could'nt believe my eye's. I found out how resonable priced it is. Well you ought to know what i did well I clicked summit order payed and could'nt wait for arrival. It was here in no time. The only thing is if you have the right coffee maker where it rains on it and 200 degrees tempature you only need 1- 1/2 to 2 scoops for 12 cups where if you use a coffee pot that spits out the water you half to use more than 3 to 4 scoops of grounds. By the time you do the math with the right coffe pot and scoops needed to make a pot coffee it is cheaper are dam near the same price for that terrible heart burn, burnt flavor, bad flavor running out of coffee grounds facter COFFEE. The only thing I enjoy more than my children (? HaHa) maybe more than my children is a good flavor Coffee to start the day off. And my 2 sons are happier because they even enjoy the better flavor to because it just makes they morning go off like a hitch.  SO IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT ORDERING WELL YOU WILL BE MAKE A GOOD DICISSION. I Hope this was helpfull Thanks for reading Tammie from Louisiana. TL;DR I'm from New Orleans and there's no other coffee in the world better tha Cummunity"
"My daughter can't get enough of these. They are just sweet enough, that she will eat them. They are the perfect snack! They travel well.

TL;DR Perfect snack for a toddler!"
"Love these pop-chips! The variety bag was a great deal, especially with the $5 off.  Tasty, low fat- just what I needed as a healthy alternative for a great price. I highly recommend these! TL;DR Excellent!!"
"I found this tea to be irritating on the stomach, even brewed ""lightly"". The taste was fine, but nothing special. TL;DR Price is decent..."
"Tried this sauce recently and it wasn't bad, per se, but had very flavor at all and none of the spicy bite I was looking for. TL;DR Bland"
"had this coffee in my cart and the price jumped to 37 bucks for 2 containers, holy cow, was 17 this morning before I went to work,<br />HOPE AND CHANGE how's that working for you !!!! TL;DR coffee is going up up up in price,"
"The mix of jelly beans is terrible, there are only 3 flavors per 2 pound bag (and they do not go well together at all!)  It was a complete waste; I will never order this again! TL;DR Belly Flops are a flop!"
"Pez Candy is Pez candy, but I couldn't find it anywhere.  I now have a very happy little Grandson who has enough Pez for his Nemo dispenser to last and last. The assorted flavors are a good idea. TL;DR Arrived as advertised"
"This is an excellent product, my 3 pups love them and this is the most convenient way to get them.  I have signed up for automatic deliveries through Amazon.com and I never have to worry about searching everywhere to get more.  It comes right to my door.  I will be looking for more of the things I always buy to be delivered automatically. To whoever thought of this for Amazon.com, thank you. TL;DR Quality and Convenience.  Imagine that."
This is my new favorite K-cup.  It's great to get me going in the morning and doesn't wilt under all the flavored creamer that I like to add.  Yum! TL;DR My new favorite!
There are no directions written in English on this package.  A friend of mine uses these packages to make Pho but I had to ask her for help incorporating these into a Pho recipe. TL;DR not easy to use
"excellent value! 50 oz bags~ largest i can find in store are 40 oz- and they are hard to find, these are fresh and good buy TL;DR always fresh and unbelievable bargain! these are 50 oz bags"
"This is a wonderful, healthy cereal and I highly recommend it. And, I feed it to my parrots (yes, it's true!) and they love it!! If you want to start eating healthier Ezekiel is the way to go. TL;DR Excellent cereal!"
"This powdered milk makes excellent yogurt.  I learned to use this milk when i was in the Caribbean Island area.  They have this widely in stores there, since they didn't have fresh milk available where I was.  So when I came back to the US I had to find it to make my yogurt and I found it at Amazon.  It is also good for making pudding. TL;DR i use this mile to make yogurt"
I drink this everyday.  I can't seem to live without it.  I give it 5 stars! TL;DR Crystal Light Strawberry Kiwi
"These cookies are really really nice! In a sense that they don't taste wired at all. I'm sure there are a lot wonderful cookies out there, but as for from online shopping, I'm really happy with it. And yes I would recommend it to anyone who likes matcha flavors! And yes I would order it agian! TL;DR Really Nice!"
I love this oil!!  It has a nice color and tastes great!  I was pleases with the price for the quality!  I will definitely buy this again. TL;DR Great coconut oil
"My girlfriend found this brand at our local Whole Foods and they are pretty delicious. We hadn't tried this particular flavor but it's pretty good and healthy. My only gripe is that I wish there was more apricots than pineapple. Though I love pineapple, it's an overwhelming taste in this mixture. TL;DR very tasty treat"
Preparation could not be easier.  The flavor was wonderful.  My son who almost never salts anything found it a bit salty for him.  My Mom who should not eat salt said she thought it was a bit salty too. TL;DR Crockery Gourmet for Beef
I was very happy to track this down to share a childhood memory with my boys. The real orange flavor and real sugar are missed. TL;DR Nesbitt's from childhood
"I was actually a little surprised that this was as good as it was, because I've tried some of the other lower calorie peanut butters, like Better N Butter (I think that's what it was called) and I actually spit it out because it tasted so artificial. If you go to the Bell Plantation site, the company that makes this stuff, there are lots of recipes that look appetizing. My only problem with this powdered peanut butter is that it's just not as satisfying as the real stuff because there's no (or not much) fat in it . So sometimes it's hard to only eat a little like you would with normal peanut butter. But the taste is very natural, not fake tasting in any way, and I loved it! TL;DR It's surprisingly good!"
"I wanted to make a chocolate ""hoho"" cake my sister had gone on & on about, and I wanted to take it to craft night where my Celiac friend would be. So I took a chance & made the recipe with this BC G-F Devil's Food mix. The cake was a hit! My Celiac friend said it was delicious. The rest of us can eat gluten & they all said it was really good. My husband almost didn't try it bc to be honest the batter looks sort of gritty & he was turned off by that. But he liked it enough that he ate 2 pieces of cake! So if you're considering trying it do it! Oh, & here's the hoho cake recipe. Try it! Go to the blog cookiesheetsandcakepans, 2011 / 07 / hoho-cake<br />PS I compared the ounces in the box to a regular mix at the store & they were so close, but as it turns out the g-f mix only makes half the amt of cake a regular mix does. Just so you know for the sake of a recipe. For the hoho cake I just adjusted the rest of the recipe & made 1/2 the amt. TL;DR So happy!"
"These prunes are flavorful but are not soft and moist like the best selling grocery store brands.  Because they are organic, because the profits go to charity and because it is so easy to buy from Amazon I do rebuy them and either stew them or soak them overnight in the Fridge.<br /><br />I wanted to give them 3.5 stars. TL;DR Hard, dry but organic and flavorful"
"These flat cookies are tasty with a nice touch of dried bkueberries.<br />The dried fruit bits are flavorful and natural tasting.<br />If your thinking blueberry flavored fig bars, that's not it. More cookie than a fruit bar, but still delicious. TL;DR Great blueberry cookies!"
"The first time I tasted it, I did not like it! But I decided to try again and is actually pretty good. I enjoy eating it after exercising or when I ""need"" something sweet. It's like a healthier and smaller granola bar. TL;DR Great product!"
"I lived in Germany and Austria for awhile as a child and grew up eating Haribo gummis.  They are an entirely different candy than the awful ""gummys"" we have here.  Wonderful, flavorful, fully addictive candy! TL;DR Way Better Than American ""Gummys"""
"I absolutely love theses bars, I just wish they sold them in stores around me. Super fast shipping! I definately reccommend you try them! TL;DR nu go gluten free bars"
"I supposed as a treat, this would do better than its dog food. But I was wrong when I received and tried it today. My dog does not like it at all. This treat feels like cookies and very dry. I got a small dog (Yorkshire). I don't know if big dog will find it delicious or not. Just my own experience. TL;DR No matter how healthy it is... is nothing if your dog doesn't like it"
gf loves it  says taste  great  cheap enoiugh  would deffinatly buy again  if you drink coffee  enjoy this one  i hate  coffee TL;DR good
I just received my order and OMG these are the best dried apricots ever.  I suspect the 12 packages I purchased will not last long and I'll be placing another order very soon. TL;DR OMG They are GREAT!
"I hate veggies...REALLY have veggies, so I used frozen wheat grass juice in smoothies, until this product was recommended to me by a colleague.  I'd be lying if I said I've ever consumed this on it's own, so I can't comment on flavor.  After my workouts, I typically make a smoothie with a few greens, a slew of fruit, and protein powder.  I dumped the trays of wheat grass, and now simply add a scoop of Amazing Grass to my amazing concoction.  Whole Foods charges over $30 for the same size container; great pricing here! TL;DR Great Price for a Great Product"
"I ordered Splenda online from Amizon.  Price was much better than in local store and it was delivered promptly to our door.  Thanks for great deal and service.<br /><br />  Rich and Patricia Armstrong  Virginia Beach, Va TL;DR Splenda Great Deal"
"While some products like the ""My K-Cup"" don't work in all brewers, the Rogers ""One Cup"" products are more compatible.  They work just fine in the Keurig B-3000, which is a large brewer aimed at the office market.  Sometimes you may get the ""no K-cup detected"" warning, but you can ignore it.<br /><br />It's great to have an alternative to the Green Mountain products. TL;DR Works in the B3000 brewer"
"I thought this was a good value.  Starbucks has a name, stores, and the price was good.  I should have saved my money and bought the equal amount of Dunkin Donuts brand whole beans cause it is so much better than this stuff.<br /><br />This coffee lacks even subtle character of Diner coffee.<br /><br />It is harsh on the pallet and coats your tongue.  French roast?  I never tasted anything this bad in France.  This is more akin to the coffee you may buy in India. TL;DR Harsh taste; why do people equate it with good coffee."
"OMG!!! I wanted a healthy snack for myself and family and my daughter has a peanut allergy, the bag does not list if it is a ""safe"" product, but i contacted the company directly and response was it was made in a nut free environment, my daughter had some and is hooked, will definitely buy more, Very Very easy to be addictive :) TL;DR GREAT NUT FREE SNACK!!!"
"We visited the south of France during the summer.  Spent time with our friends who live there.  They made us the most delicious dinner one evening.  Using these bricks...they rolled a ball of mozzarella in thyme, and then rolled a thin slice of prosciutto around the mozzarella ball/thyme.  Then rolled it up in a brick and baked them for about 15 minutes.  I was obsessed with finding these bricks.  I went to gourmet store after gourmet store here to no avail.  Finally, on Amazon, I found them!  Whew.  I didn't want to have to travel all the way back to France to get them! TL;DR Forget about finding in a gourmet store...find it here!"
"I love BAR Harbor's Red Clam Sauce<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2CLME"">Bar Harbor All Natural Red Clam Sauce, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>. This however was just plain nasty. smelled terrible, but gave it a taste anyway.  I taste likes iodine and clorox smells. TL;DR Just plain nasty, tasted and smelled like iodine and clorox. had to throw away."
"My family and I have been using the Good Seasons Cheese Garlic dressing for as long as I can remember.  We have found a number of our local stores have discontinued it on their shelves, so we now buy it on Amazon.com by the 24-pack box.  We still have to replenish our stock every few months! TL;DR The best dressing"
"My Mom is a great biscotti baker, she has traditionally relied on McCormick/Schiling extracts.  Since using the JR Mushrooms and Specialties extract her biscotti's tastes even better and aroma is unprecedented. TL;DR Amazon Lemon Extract Rocks!"
"These are not great tasting like the other combos I have tried. They are just ""good"" nothing I would purchase again, but something that is eatable and not worth to complain about either while eating them. & They are not spicy at all. TL;DR They taste good"
The coffee is excellent the price great. After my K cup took a dive I gave the T-disc a try Wow. It was better than any of the K-cup brands I had. The only unfortunate draw back is you can't seem to get the T-disc in stores. Good thing Amazon has them at a good price. TL;DR Not too bad
"Hawaiian Host Scenic Chocolate Macadamias has good reputation from the island, but somehow this seller found a way to mess it up.  Sent me a box of old, out dated chocolate.  The chocolate doesn't have any taste, and it covers a white powdery coat.  NASTY....never again i order from this seller.. TL;DR aged chocolate."
"I always buy this one as I only use air popped corn kernels and these give you extra large, fluffy popcorn!  Wonderful! TL;DR Love these xlarge kernels!"
"First off, this is very intense, just a step or two up from baking chocolate in taste,  with  the same texture as Lindt 80% cocoa bars. That's something I never thought I'd find in sugar free! It's so strong , that a smaller amount is more satisfying. If you can't get your chocolate dark enough, this is it! YUM!<br /><br />The only down side? That bag of sugar-free Dove just lost its appeal! Here's hoping that more flavors join the  line (pssst- how about mint?) TL;DR The only kind I'll be buying from now on!"
"I had purchased this salt previously from another site, and I was very happy to find it here.  I use the salt stones for a relaxing bath, the coarse salt in my salt mill, and the fine salt in my shakers.  I love the flavor of the salt, and I enjoy the fact that this salt is natural and not chemically produced like most table salt.  I hope to continue enjoying this salt for years to come. TL;DR I love this salt, and I will never go back to regular salt."
"My husband and I tried this tea when visiting family in Florida.  This was probably the best sweet tea that I've tried that was both sweet enough for my husband yet not overly sweet to me.  It had a pure taste to it without any acidic aftertaste from citrus or chemicals which I find with other bottled sweet teas that even state ""sweetened - no lemon"".<br /><br />After about a year, this is slowly making its way to the grocery chains in Arizona and mainly found in the ""organic food"" aisles, but they only carry the smaller 20oz(?) bottles instead of the 64oz bottles.  Therefore, Amazon is still my ""go-to"" location to purchase this in bulk in the size I prefer. TL;DR Great flavor, convenient delivery!"
"Don't order these unless you need a laxative!  These cookies contain the sweetener ""maltitol"" which has a laxative effect.  THAT'S WITH ONE COOKIE!  This should have been stated with the nutrition facts on the box. The canister type container of Jennie's Brand macaroons is wonderful!<br />This BIG box contained 10 quarter-sized cookies, too.  I wouldn't have really wanted more after it's effect on my system, but for the price..... TL;DR laxative cookies"
"I buy this Imagine brand or Kroger's Naturally Preferred brand organic free range chicken broth which is exactly the same thing (depending on which is on sale) at my local Kroger store in quart size containers - 32 oz.  I wish Amazon stocked it in 32 oz. containers at a competitive price.  A 16 oz. container would never do for us.<br /><br />It is absolutely wonderful for soups of any kind, from chicken noodle with veggies added to vegetable soup to bean soup or whatever.  Since we do not eat beef or pork I use this broth as the base of everything that needs broth.  I also use small quantities of it to 'quick saute' veggies, per the recommendation on whfoods.org and it works as well as oils which break down when heated.<br /><br />Heated in a pan by itself it is not so good.  However, since we don't eat ""plain"" anything, in my opinion this is THE best broth with no potato starch, bad oils or MSG. TL;DR Great for soups and stews but need larger size"
"What a disaster!  Took this seller four days just to START the shipping process, it will take another three days to arrive!  for a total of a week!  What is this, the 1970's and ordering something from the Sears catalog!?!?!?!<br /><br />Beware and stay away!  Proflowers stinks!  If you don't have the capability and/technology for quick shipment, especially around a ""flower"" holiday like Mothers Day, then don't even try to enter into this business segment!<br /><br />I will NEVER buy from Proflowers again!!!<br /><br />Not very ""professional,"" time to change your company name! TL;DR This item/seller is a disaster!!!"
"I bought these cookies because they were rated #1 by Consumer Reports magazine, which calls them ""tender"".  Ha!<br /><br />If you like dark, thin, crispy cookies, then these are for you.  However, I'm a thick and chewy type of cookie gal, so these aren't the best tasting cookies, IMHO.<br /><br />To be more objective, I would say that they are baked a wee bit (1 minute?) too long.  Some people--my husband being one, but then again, he likes burnt toast!--like overbaked cookies. Not me.<br /><br />I saw his two cookies each had one chocolate chip. I checked my two--one of which<br />I put back in the package after I decided I don't like Tate's--and my remaining cookie also had one chip.  Dang! TL;DR Buyer beware--you MIGHT like these cookies (or might not)"
"i have tried many brands of the hot chocolates but this by far has been the best.  now, i realize it is thousand percent cheaper to just use the package you can buy at the store and add water but if you want to impress than this is the product. TL;DR delicious!"
Delicious gum....love strawberry!  The gum came soft and full of flavor. Received my package in the mail in about a week.<br /><br />Very pleased and will order again TL;DR YUM!
"This stuff is FANTASTIC.  Throw salmon in skillet, sprinkle some of this on, and voila!  Most delicious home-cooked salmon you'll ever have, no sauce necessary. TL;DR Best salmon prep ever!"
"Let me start out by answering the question: Is this the best coffee? No. Nespresso still tates better. They after all are, created the system, have the research, and know what makes the ideal capsule.<br /><br />Will you notice a difference with a shot of pure espresso? Yes, BUT:<br />Will you notice a difference in your cappuccino, latte, or other coffee drink? No.<br /><br />Will you feel better about supporting a company with far better business practices than Nestle, a company with nontoxic, biodegradable compost-able capsules (Nespresso capsules may be aluminum and recyclable but there are still plastics and glues that are not eco friendly in those capsules), and yet are still less expensive by far? Of course! What do you think?<br /><br />If you're worried that the capsule ruin your machine? Absolutely not. They give this guarantee on their website:<br />""Our experience has shown us that the Nespresso Club* may try to make you believe that our capsules damage your machine.<br />This is simply untrue. Our capsules are slightly more resistant.** This has no effect on your machine.<br />As proof, we promise to replace your machine should any problem be caused by one of our capsules as part of the machine's routine use.""<br /><br />After doing research I also discovered that the former CEO of Nespresso runs this company, so they clearly know their competition.<br /><br />Bottom line: i will keep ordering these capsules for quick shots, and morning cappucinos and coffee drinks, but I am still searching for something as good as the original nespresso branded ristretto and espresso capsules (as a frame of reference,  my two favorites would be the purple capsule aka the arpeggio and burgundy capsule aka the decaffeinato intenso).<br /><br />Hopefully the other flavors of this brand will make the cut because i love what they do. TL;DR Good coffee but even better company"
"Our rat terrier was losing her fur, had pinkish skin, and sores.  The vet put her on a hypoallergenic food, but in time she started vomiting that.  We found Wellness Simple Solutions and now her skin is normal, fur is growing back, no sores, no vomiting. I highly recommend this product. TL;DR Best we've found!"
The Cashew arrived with a weird smell when eating them. I think they might be bad... It's more safe to purchase from local food markets. TL;DR Smells weird
"I really like a strong, but not bitter. This coffee was bold and delicious.This coffee meets all my needs. And I am sure that it will help your morning get off to a great start. I loved it! TL;DR Delicious!"
"*****<br />I have tasted lots and lots of green teas, and this Gen Mai Cha is so different from any other one I've ever tried! It says on the package that it is nutty and savory and smooth---this is all true. I would add that it has a flavor that does indeed taste like toasted rice, and feels like a ""comfort food"" too---just so unique and yummy! It looks just like regular tea, and you can't discern anything that is rice-like about it, except in the taste. The package says that it is a ""medium caffeine"" tea.<br /><br />The only ingredients in this tea are organic Sencha Green tea and toasted rice, but the flavors are complex and interesting and exotic. I have only had a few cups but I can tell that I will order this tea again and again.<br /><br />This is worth a try for everyone really, for those like me who love green tea, or for those who don't like it and would like to try something different.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />***** TL;DR Unique and Lovely Green Tea"
"Thought they were okay at first.  They seemed a little more oily than normal.  By time I got to bottom of bag the last 4-5 ears had a weird molding stuff on them.  Ended up throwing away.  May have just been a bad batch.  Probably came from China.  I think the Chinese have some sort of conspiracy to kill our dogs.  Seems to be a lot of recalls over dog treats that come from China.<br /><br />My newest batch came from some good old boys in Iowa.  I'm feeling a lot better about them.  Few more bucks, but hey, my pets are my kids. TL;DR got moldy"
"I have tried all of the flavors and have to say that chocolate is my least favorite. However, the vanilla, pb creme, and wild berry are all awesome.  The wild berry is almost like a strawberry birthday cake made into a wafer bar.  There is a pb fudge that is just ok. They should sell a variety box!  Also, get these shipped in cooler months. And I recommend storing in freezer. :)  And i forgot the cookies n creme.... Also delicious! TL;DR Awesome!"
"I was skeptical when I saw the package, and assumed that this would be a very sweet, sugary lemon drink with a smidgen of ginger.  Was I wrong!  When I added the mix to hot water, it was very brown in color, so I thought it might taste like a sweet tea.  Was I wrong!  This stuff is super gingery, with much more of a ginger element than a lemon element, and it is not too sweet.  I love ginger, so i was very happy.  But if you're lukewarm on ginger or don't like the bite of fresh ginger, this probably isn't for you.<br /><br />One minor gripe -- the ingredients were not listed on the single foil package I received, so I couldn't tell how much sugar, ginger, or other products were in the package. TL;DR very, very gingery -- with a bite"
"I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.<br /><br />But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products. TL;DR 25% chance of rancid chips - No Thanks"
"This is good, but it has too many apples.  I was hoping for more berries.  I was also hoping the kids would like to snack on it, but neither one (a 2 and 6 year old) really likes them.  They are also difficult to eat because the pieces are so small.  However, that makes it great for sprinkling on cereal or oatmeal.  Overall, a good product, worth a try. TL;DR Heavy on apples"
"I love arborio rice but was having a really hard time getting it in the store. Plus, in the store it was super expensive, about $8 for a small little container of it! This was such a great deal, good bulk price and the quality is good. It came in the mail with no problems. Would recommend! I am not a big cook but my husband and I like to make a good meal for our family of four. TL;DR Yum!"
"Pilon is as real as you can get to old style Cuban expresso.  Once you've tasted it, you will laugh at the Italian varieties, and defenetly at StarRipoffs (I mean StarBucks).<br /><br />One shot of this Rocket Fuel and you are set to conquer the world! TL;DR Cuban Rocket Fuel from Miami..."
I love this product and you can't beat the price.<br />Trying to find gluten free products that taste<br />good and don't cost a fortune is a real problem.<br />I've tried all of the Mary's crackers and my favorites<br />are the original and the pepper. TL;DR Crazy for Mary's crackers
This product was recommended by a doctor because it does not have the not-so-good-for-you ingredients of regular sugar-free gum.  Have only been able to find it at a couple of stores like Whole Foods and Wegman's.  Usually they are out of stock.  So much more convenient to purchase on Amazon and have it shipped to my door.  And at a better price! TL;DR SPRY GUM purchased at Amazon.com
"This is so good I had to restrain myself from eating the entire cooked contents myself! Simple to make! Cooks quickly! A hardy fast healthy meal that everyone loved!<br /><br />This is my first time trying this product, but I will buy it again...and again and again and again!<br /><br />I will be trying other items under this brand name. I would suspect they are just as good. TL;DR AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This is the most uique way to make a statement at your special event, we used the large flowers for the adult champagne toast and the small flowers for the kids shirley temple drinks.  We also had the bartender at the venue ""Hyatt"" create a signature drink for the bride/groom. This was the talk of the party, all the guests wanted to know where we found and bought them.  This will be a nice presentation at a bridal shower.  I can not say enough about this item, you will not be disappointed. TL;DR Elegant & Gorgeous"
"These bottles are very tiny, but man, do they pack quite the taste!!  This is the very best white truffle oil I've ever had!  It's pricey for it's size but you won't regret it.  Try it on popcorn with a sprinkle of himalayan salt, omg, YUM! TL;DR Amazing"
"I was little hesitant ordering this since people were talking about receiving smashed bottles, but I couldn't pass up the deal.  I received mine in speedy time and the bottles were all individually bubble wrapped and inside a plastic thing and then inside the box.  Nothing was broken at all and the extract is amazing! TL;DR Nothing Broken"
This soup has been a pantry staple for over 20 years. Now I can no longer find it on the shelves of local stores. I was very pleased to find it available on line and I found the on-line shopping experience to be without fault. I have shared the soup with family members and will be buying again. TL;DR Mrs. Grass Chicken Soup Mix
"Far better than the aggressively mundane flavor of the Peanut Butter and Banana `monkey bar', these Strawberry Vanilla bars at least have a pleasant and refreshing flavor.  The lightness of the flavor is delicate but I will admit that it isn't anything special.  I am still left a little iffy on these bars.  The frosted coating on the underbelly is nice and sweet, and the nuttiness of the bar itself has more depth than a standard health bar, that can come off tasting like cardboard, but I still want something more.  I don't know, maybe my expectations are unrealistically high, but when you call yourself a Monkey Bar and have that playful critter on the cover of your box you'd think that maybe you could have a little bit more fun with your flavors. TL;DR Better, but still lacking..."
"These are fabulous!  Just enough salt, plenty of crunch.  I will be ordering more because the kids love them.  I plan to try some of their other products as well. TL;DR Excellent!"
"Not only is this product good for adding nice flavors for cooking, but My wife also uses it as a face and body moisturizer. She says that it is much better than any lotion or cream and you can also use it as a leave-in hair conditioner. And Amazon's price makes it affordable. TL;DR Nice for cooking"
"I really like hot chocolate all year round but find that drinking more than one cup is just not a good idea in hot weather.  I had to literally force myself to drink the entire cup. The white chocolate, as well as the regular chocolate, had a funky taste to it. At first I just thought I was something about the white chocolate, since I don't usually drink white chocolate, but then the next day I tried the regular and the same taste was there.  I have made tea and coffee in my brewer, and the taste wasn't there.  I have also made other kids of hot chocolate without the taste, so I would have to say that it is just in this particular product.  I unfortunately cannot send this product back due to my location, but I know I will never by anything by this company again. TL;DR Very Disappointing"
"Well I liked the idea of the noodles. I took seasoning from an oodles of noodles packet and put it on the Shirataki noodles. Still way to much sodium there, but I was just testing them out. They were just ok. I could tell they weren't real noodles. It was a texture thing. I haven't given up on them though. I still plan on trying some of the recipes out from the web site. I also plan to try some of my own recipes out using them in place of other types of noodles. Slightly expensive at Two dollars average for a seven ounce bag. But what diet food is cheap? I even decided to buy the rice noodles and want to give them a try as well. Will get back to you on my final opinion. TL;DR When is rice not rice"
"Product was as advertised.<br />I have not used much, as yet.  So I am assuming the quality is good as well. TL;DR Good product"
"It's a great soy protein powder.  Very pure, and very tasteless, so you can seriously add it to anything.  I throw a tablespoon in practically everything--cereals, spaghetti sauce, etc.  It's a nice thickening agent as well.<br /><br />It will clump if you simply toss it into a glass of cold liquid, so either have a blender handy, or deal with lumps.  Protein's protein, IMO--I can deal with lumps. TL;DR Good stuff"
"Various MAGGI seasonings are offered in groceries. If you choose free super saver shipping you find this size.<br />Unfortunately the content is NOT mentioned.<br />Well, it contains 800ml fyi. Compared with the 1Lt size (and price plus SH&H) you do much better to order this one.<br /><br />Being from Europe we are used to MAGGI products in any form and size and are happy to get it at this price from Amazon. Thank you ! TL;DR Maggi - a necessity in the kitchen"
I used this candy for the candy bar at my wedding. Everyone loved them. They were far better than the average gummy bears. The day after the wedding I had three people leave messages on my Facebook account to ask me to ask where I had gotten them. I got jelly beans from this company as well and they were awesome too. TL;DR Yummy!
"Overall, this was a decent price for the volume of biodegradable poop bags...the only problem was that each bag in 1 entire roll (orange)did not have an opening on 1 side (i.e. both ends were closed). Defective. Also, these bags are hard to open in the cold as we can't figure out where the opening is each time & it doesn't initially open easily when rubbed together to find the opening. Overall, ok for the cost (although, I think I found similar cost at Home Goods with cute colors too). One note for ""big"" dog owners; these bags are small. It's ok for us as we have mini dogs. TL;DR 1 entire roll out of 8 defective"
"I don't like dark chocolate but I can't live without these. They were sent to me by a friend as a gift and I was not sure what to think. Now, I am buying them for myself. The tangy pomegranate covered in dark chocolate was the perfect mix of yummy! TL;DR Yummy!"
"I've been generally happy with the k-cup selections I've made over the years, and this is no exception. It's flavorful and balanced... what you would expect from a Sumatra. No, it's not like going to your favorite coffee shop, but it's very good for this level of coffee making. Would buy again. TL;DR Would Buy Again!"
"I really wanted to like this toy. If it didn't have small batteries and brittle plastic inside the mouse I would probably give it two stars, as I can still use the string and the thing that goes over the top of the door with some less dangerous toy tied to it. But at this point I'm watching my cat closely, hoping he didn't swallow one of the batteries or some of the other parts that caused the mouse to squeak so realistically. TL;DR My cat tore the squeaky mouse apart in a few hours"
"Since the absurd boycott of Danish products in the Middle East over cartoons, it is good for the west and freedom to support Denmark. Their Lurpak butter and Arla cheeses are delicious and available on-line and at many grocery stores in the US. Buy, you'll like! TL;DR support denmark during middle eastern boycott"
"My pup enjoyed the flavor of the bone, bit its weird that it doesn't break down. TL;DR its ok"
"I have been exploring the range of k-cups looking for my favorites. While the Timothy's Italian Roast isn't bad, there are better options.<br /><br />I like my coffee starbucks style: bold, strong, with lots of character. As a point of reference, my current faves are Coffee People Black Tiger, Tullys French Roast and Italian Roast, Emeril's French Roast, and Coffee People Sumatra and Dark Magic. I tried the Timothy's version of the Italian roast expecting a similar flavor to others I have tried in the bold varieties, and I found it to be on the weak side. It does have some of the nice smokey elements that you expect from an Italian roast... but Tullys does it better if you are looking for full flavor.<br /><br />If you prefer a medium bodied roast with some punch you will be happy with this, but it wasn't for me. TL;DR OK, but there are better choices"
"The product was shipped fast and packaged in adequate shipping materials.  I've never seen a bag of sour patch watermelon this big before, and I'm happy that I made this purchase. TL;DR Delicious"
"I met the local distributor (Shawn) while he was delivering product to our neighborhood store, and I've been buying it since.  I know that I will never put down the soda or energy drinks, so I figured that I may as well drink one that is good for me.  I've actually lost 10 lbs by substituting soda and monster energy for this drink.  I have no illusion that this is a magical cure all drink, but all the ingredients are natural, all the calories are dietary(from honey), and it contain none of the chemical simulants that the other ""energy"" drinks do. I actually don't consider this an ""energy"" drink, but a healthy substitute for them and soda.  Like I stated before, I'm not gonna put down the soda, so if I'm gonna drink junk... I'm gonna drink junk thats better for me! TL;DR If you're gonna drink junk.... Drink good junk!"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8ESBO"">Flavour Creations Coffee Flavoring Tablets, French Vanilla, 48-Count Dispensers (Pack of 6)</a>Excellent product -- highly recommend.  Used for more than 3 years and am finding it harder and harder to find. TL;DR Coffee flavoring"
"I was very sad when I found out this was discontinued, it's my favorite popcorn! After much trial and error I found a way to replicate the flavor pretty well. Take a bag of the powdered cheese sauce mix out of a box of Annie's macaroni and cheese and mix it with around 6 Tbsp oil and stir. Pour over hot popcorn and voila! I have tried a few other brands besides Annie's but they haven't worked out as well. Kraft was the worst, they must put thickening agents in their powered cheese because when I mixed it with oil got REALLY thick and gross. I put it on the popcorn anyway, and it made it taste slimy. I've only tried this with Annie's cheddar and white cheddar flavors, but I think it would taste good with others. I put this mixture on the cheddar cheese popcorn Orville made to replace the cheddar cheese pour over. It requires a teeny bit more effort, but it's worth it if you REALLLLLY loved the cheddar cheese pour over. I hope this helps!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQ6KTM"">Annie's Homegrown Totally Natural Shells & Real Aged Cheddar Mac & Cheese, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> TL;DR Discontinued, I found a (decent) substitute"
"After you've made the customary, authentic English trifle with Bird's custard powder you might not want to go back to the usual grocery-store pudding packages. I DID purchase a large quantity of Bird's custard power, the pack of six, but the packs have a longish shelf life, and I enjoyed sending a surprise pack/container to a friend who is originally from England.<br /><br />At Christmas, I will also include a container of Bird's custard powder to special relatives and friends so they can learn how easy it is to make excellent trifle with this product. For my non-English family and friends, I will include laminated instructions based on my own successes with Bird's custard recipe for trifle.<br /><br />English trifle is so easy to make with the following:  Bird's custard powder, store-bought pound cake, thawed frozen fruit, some sherry wine (or slightly sweetened juice from the thawed frozen fruit) poured over the small slices of cake. For the final touch, add non-dairy whipped ""creme."" Delicious and inexpensive! I highly recommend this product and am so pleased to be able to purchase it through Amazon. And the price for the six  containers is so very reasonable as to almost be unreal. Go for it! TL;DR The true, the classic custard for authentic, yummy English trifle"
I can not find it anywhere! this is my fav soup..... is there any way to order a smaller quantity? please help!! TL;DR Did they stop stocking this in the stores?!
OK....so I do love lifesavers. But I don't want to have to fight to open the stupid packaging of every single one of them. What's up with that? I have arthritis and this is a real chore trying to eat these things. TL;DR packaging ugh!
"As a serious chocoholic, I have to say that this is the best cocoa powder I have tasted.  Amazon sells some others which are very good, even excellent, but for my hot cocoa addiction, this brand is absolutely the best, with a very distinct but balanced and satisfying flavor.  I would recommend this one for any chocolate afficionado. TL;DR My favorite cocoa"
I've ordered this tea about 3 times before and will order it again.  I first had this tea at a Chinese restaurant and can only find it online.  I don't like black tea and not a fan of green tea so this oolong tea is just right.  I don't make it really strong so I steep it for about 3 1/2 minutes and it's good to drink. TL;DR Repeat buy
This is what I grab at night when I need a treat or when I'm on the run. It is about as good as it gets in flavor and wholesome ingredients.I would recommend this to all vegetarian and vegans. TL;DR Good and chewy
"The Sparkling ICE line up are all extremely addicting, this one included. I love that they are all flavorful, calorie free (and carb free, gluten free, caffeine free), and carbonated. I used to have periodic cravings for one of my husband's cokes and always hated myself for giving in. I always thought it was the sugar I was craving until I tried these a year ago and realized that it's actually the carbonation I would crave. These are a guilt-free way of feeding those cravings.<br /><br />The only thing I would note is that it is sweetened with Splenda. Splenda doesn't bother me at all but my husband can instantly tell the difference and ends up with a stomach ache any time he consumes it so unfortunately these can't help me to get him off his soda kick. So if you are also sensitive to Splenda, this isn't the product for you.<br /><br />The Orange Mango flavor isn't one of my absolute favorites (that goes to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P00PGQ"">Sparkling ICE Mountain  Spring Water, Pomegranate Berry, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FUL4AE"">TalkingRain Sparkling ICE Lemonade, 17-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a>) but it is delicious all the same. I think it comes across as being more mangoish than orangish as well. TL;DR Love Sparkling ICE Brand (Stay away if you're sensitive to Splenda)"
"i was very skeptical having tried other gluten free pastas in the past (rice, quinoa...).<br />this stuff tastes great! i think i actually prefer it to the regular wheat pasta.<br />i cooked it a little longer than directed - tasted it after recommended 8 minutes didn't feel it was done, so i kept cooking it and tasting every 2 minutes until it was perfect. added some pasta sauce w/ spinach & broccoli and feta cheese. my picky 5 year old ate it up and asked for more! now i'm signing up for auto-ship - great price too! TL;DR gluten free pasta never tasted so good!"
I bought this for my dad and he loved it! He's a coffee drinker so thats why I got it for him. He said he loved everything in it. So this would be a good gift for a coffee drinker! TL;DR Great Gift!
"I was very pleased to find that I could purchase ""Pamelas Bread Mix"" on Amazon because my husband was recently diagnosed with Celiac disease, and good tasting ""Gluten Free"" mixes are hard to find.  I was thrilled to find the product, the price was less than I had spent at the Health food store, and I was able to get 10 bags for FREE shipping! TL;DR Gluten Free Products"
"This is hands down the best honey I have ever put in my mouth. In fact, it's so good that I give it annually for Christmas gifts. Watch out, though - this will spoil you for that stuff sold in the bear-shaped bottles! There is simply no comparison between this and the product carried in grocery stores. Because it's expensive, I don't cook with it. But I love it on toast or muffins, in tea, or anywhere that the honey flavor really comes through. TL;DR Best honey on the planet"
"These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.  I found that I got a stronger ""kick"" from the horseradish if I sucked on the almond first before eating it. TL;DR Eh, they're all right"
"Our whole family is addicted to this. It's sooo good over tacos, in burritos, or as a dip for carrots or veggies or just about anything! We love it! TL;DR Addicted!"
"Bakerella recommends these in their cake pop book.  So much better than Wilton's!  No bleeding at all, bright colors, like using a magic marker.  I noticed some inconsistency in wetness/dryness between different colors; the purple and pink don't work as well as the others in the bag.  Don't know if it's characteristic of the color or inconsistent product quality.  Would definitely purchase again. TL;DR Great for cake pops!"
"We have been sunflower seed fans for years(at least 25). We have tried them all Fisher,Davids,FritosLays but none compare to BIGS.<br />Plain seeds were never all that tasty(but flavors back then weren't<br />to be found)then we discovered ranch,they were good and we were happy until the BIGS Dill pickles came in to our lives.<br />....OMG the best...<br />Not only the size but the delicious flavor,it's a great addiction!<br />We now buy them buy the case!!<br />Thanks BIGS... cheers to another 25 years!! TL;DR Terrific Tasty ""Big""seeds"
"I have been buying direct from bariani for about 8 years.  I used to take orders from people in the office and order cases.  Never had a single negative comment.<br /><br />Why would I want a delicate oil shipped to a store, then shipped to me.<br /><br />Rated best olive oil produced in US.  See tv videos online.  [...] TL;DR BUY DIRECT"
"I have compared this with the Tao of Tea Rose petal black, and it's far superior. Not only do you get more quantity, the quality is higher as well. This tea has larger, tastier leaves, larger and more abundant rose petals, and doesn't contain any ""rose essence"" to make up for lack of flavor as the aforementioned brand does (check the ingredients).<br /><br />This is great iced as well! Also, try it with a bit of raw organic honey. I can't keep enough tins of this in stock I love it so much. TL;DR My favorite Rose Petal leaf tea"
"....but it was the first time we'd ordered through Amazon, as our local dealer went out of business. I'm so pleased with Life4K9's product. We have a small breed dog whose breed is known for skin problems and food allergies. Since switching to this food our pup's mild eczema has cleared completely. I like the fact that I'm feeding him something that's good for him and isn't stuffed with fillers and binders. TL;DR We've used this food before"
Sellers image does not match item they shipped to us. We had purchased this exact catnip from a local Pet Smart in the large plastic cylinder container identical to the image displayed by the seller on Amazon. When we received our shipment - it came in a small plastic bag.<br /><br />This item is not as advertised - 1. By the image 2. By the weight TL;DR Did Not Receive What We Ordered
"This is a classic green tea that brews up to a pale amber liquor with a fine grassy scent. Savor this tea for a delicate and elusive experience. The taste is barley, sweet hay and the faintest herbal taste. The aftertaste is very mild and fresh.<br /><br />Green tea is touted for its health benefits--not just antioxidants but also because it is supposed to help you lose weight!! Green tea averages about 10-30 mg of caffeine as opposed to 90 mg in a cup of coffee. Tazo does not put how much caffeine is in their tea on the box. TL;DR Health enhancing with a clean refreshing taste!"
"For kids and adults alike, these granola cereal bars are worth the extra dollars. They have a unique whole grain taste. Great on the go snack. Waiting to try other flavors. TL;DR Yummy and Nutritious!"
"I may live in Seattle, but I drink tea, not coffee. I want a nice Darjeeling Tea I can count on for my primary daytime beverage, and this tea is it. TL;DR A very reasonable tea"
"It's all good stuff, in my opinion- especially since it's sugar-free.  Price and service inspiring!  A++++ TL;DR Flavorful!"
The recipe on the box makes the best cookies! Our three sons and their families always look forward to eating them. We have used this product for at least 44 years (we just celebrated our anniversary last month).  Too bad our local supermarkets stopped stocking this mincemeat product!  They only carry the moist mincemeat in a jar.  Some people just don't know what they're missing!! TL;DR Cookies!
"What a great purchase.  I was originally looking for the ice coffee k-cups but they are ridiculously expensive (I feel).  After reading that their is not much of a difference and I was most concerned of the ""watered down"" taste so I thought and ""extra bold"" strength would do the trick, which it did!!!! I will be buying more soon and in a larger quantity now that I know how well it works ;)p TL;DR Boston"
I've done the 7mins and various other times for cooking and can't seem to get this right.  My family is not a fan of this product.  I'm trying to figure out now what I can hide it in.  I've had other rice pastas that hold their shape better.  If I did the 7 min it was still a bit not finished and then any time longer would turn it to mush and it wouldn't hold it's shape. TL;DR Too mushy
"Of all the coffees offered for the Keurig brewer, this is by far my favorite. I like a strong bold cup and this is just right in the morning. Too bad there is limited supply. Don't know if there is Kona coffee in it or not and it does not matter to me. TL;DR Best cup of coffee"
"This product tastes great,like a vacation in a bottle. As a canadian,i have to cross the border to get it,as its not for sale here yet,but i live close to buffalo anyway. Thing is, in the local tops store,these sell for about $1.29 i think (though they never have this flavour,but the other flavours are good too). A store in the galleria mall has them for about $2.29, way more than tops,but less than Amazons price here,especially adding the $12 to ship. If you are near a Tops,or the galleria mall,buy the singles and save some cash on a great tasting product. TL;DR tasty,but too expensive here..."
"Having been a tea drinker all my life and having tried teas from all over the world, I have settled as Brooke Bond Taj Mahal as my staple tea for every day use.  It is by far the best value (at 6 about cents for a full bodied invigorating cup) .  Try it, especially if you like strong tea, and you will not regret it. There are better teas available, but they can cost many times more. TL;DR The best value for your tea dollars"
So glad to see this at a decent price at Amazon. Not easy to find Half Caff. I would even buy this in a larger quantity box.  Plus shipping was FREE. What more can you ask for. Green Mountain is my favorite and Amazon makes i happen. TL;DR Keurig Brewers Half Caff
"Anyone that has lived in Germany knows the Asbach Uralt brand and they make the very best cordial cherries in the world! I purchased the box for mom. Her comment is ""they're delicious and go too quickly!"" As a former resident of Germany I can highly recommend these delicious brandy filled cordial cherries to anyone in need of a cool gift idea. Any Asbach Uralt product makes a great gift.<br /><br />I used to be able to purchase these in a German grocery store in Orlando, but was unable to locate them anywhere, and the store is now closed.<br /><br />Even in the holiday mail rush, and using standard shipping, the box from Niche Imports arrived quickly. I ordered on December 5th and it arrived on December 10th packaged perfectly in a larger box and cushioned with styrofoam pieces. TL;DR The Absolute Best!"
"The product was such a great price, and it made my food taste so good.  I had a hard time finding this product elsewhere. TL;DR great product"
"Paul Newman is great!<br />these are fantastic! It tastes like ginger & honey, but like the real deal.<br />Altoids are my usual pick for ginger....but after theses the other brand is REAL sweet to me. I prefer the honey instead of white sugar taste!<br />Try 'em they're typical paul newman quality. TL;DR Wow"
"This is a pretty-tasty tea mix and I like the slim profile of the packet which allows you to pretty much stash it anywhere you want until you need it. The ""open here"" slot makes it easy to rip the end of the pouch open without having to use your teeth, but the hole that results is a little small for the tea to pass through easily, which means you got to work it through for a couple seconds, causing a little powdery mist to form outside of your drink container if you're not careful.<br /><br />At first, I thought it was the container I used to mix the tea in-or maybe that I was using tap water-that was causing this slight bitter beginning-taste to it. But it isn't either of those things. The powder just has a slight taste to it that may or may not turn you off to the drink.<br /><br />Each packet is 10 calories and 2 carbs. It says 5 calories, but if you take a second glance, that's for 8 oz of water; the full packet makes 16oz. If the directions are for 16oz of water with a small bottle of water pictured (like the kirkland signature ones from costco), then can we get a nutritional count for the whole 16oz, please? I didn't dock anything off the rating for this, given that it's printed right on the packet, but c'mon...<br /><br />Overall, a nice little product to give your bottled water some extra tasty kick. Not a fan of that first split-second it hits the palate, but if you're busy, you might not even notice. TL;DR Pretty tasty and convenient, but with a slight weird beginning-taste."
These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good. TL;DR I love these chips.  They are thick and crunchy!
"I had been buying Trader Joe's Grade B for about the same price.  TJ is kind of a drive so I used the prime and this is far superior.  Used Alton Brown's recipe for buttermilk pancakes from scratch, added blueberries and this syrup capped off a great breakfast. TL;DR Good, rich flavor"
"The Amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product.  The picture claims DOP certified.  Neither appears to be true.  The cans I received were just ""certified"", and it didn't say by who.  There is no USDA Organic label either.  I also knew all these things before I bought them since they are well documented in the Amazon reviews already, so I wasn't surprised by what I received.<br /><br />On the plus side, they are better tomatoes than I can buy canned in the grocery stores locally, so I'm happy enough with them, and I used reward points from my Amazon.com Visa to buy them, so they were essentially free to me.<br /><br />Would I buy them again?  Maybe.  If couldn't get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.  As I said, they are tasty and I do like them better than what I can buy locally, but they aren't the top tomato when it comes to what I can mail order. TL;DR False and misleading product data, but they do taste good"
"Saffron is so hard to find at grocery stores because it's too expensive to stock. However, that's misleading because a little Saffron goes an awfully long way. Buying Saffron from Amazon makes perfect sense and McCormick Saffron comes nicely packaged in an airtight container so you know it's fresh. Saffron is truly the King of all Spices. TL;DR Great Value"
"I found this tea about 8 years ago, and it is now the only type of tea bag I use.  Unfortunately, in my area, there is only one supermarket chain that carries it, and they are frequently sold out of it.  Being able to purchase it from Amazon is a great convenience. TL;DR Great Chai tea - hard to find in stores"
Nothing wrong with product as Planters nuts are always a favorite. But the box arrived with one flap pulled up and after counting the packages inside I discovered that it was one short of the salted peanuts (should be 12). Because of the limitations of contacting Amazon about problems - you must repackage item and return everything - I am keeping the item because it is part of a care package for my Marine nephew in Afghanistan. I am just so disappointed that someone was so hungry they had to steal from my shipment and I wish there was a direct contact with Amazon where you could share this kind of incident instead having to return everything for replacement or credit. TL;DR Package Theft and Tampering
"This coffee is rich, dark, flavorful and aromatic, from Holland.  The taste stands out among all the other available brands of coffee, in all forms.  It has the perfect pure, full coffee flavor and it tastes just like it smells.  I first tasted Douwe Egberts coffee at a friend's home.  I had no idea what she had given me, but it was good enough to ask her what it was.  She had given me a cup of instant Douwe Egberts coffee, from a jar she had purchased in Germany.  The taste was so good and it didn't in any way resemble any instant coffee I ever had.  I thought she had brewed a pot of something special for me.  My next experience was at a restaurant, when I ordered a cup of coffee after dinner.  It was amazingly good, and when I asked the waitress what kind of coffee it was, she told me Douwe Egberts.  I noticed a pattern here.  I then began my search for the coffee.  I couldn't find a store that sells Douwe Egberts coffee, so I found it online at Amazon, and ordered two bags of whole bean.  I experimented with amounts, and finally produced that perfect cup that I had in the restaurant.  Douwe Egberts provided the best morning coffee I've ever made. Since the price is not prohibitive, I will be ordering more. TL;DR Restaurant coffee at home"
"I'm used to overly sweet granola bars, so when I first had these it seemed like they needed some sugar. But by the time I got through the first box, I adjusted to the lower sugar content and found myself thoroughly addicted. They have a lovely chewy texture with plenty of huge chunks of almond for added crunch. These are GOOD! I would love to buy them in bulk and have them shipped automatically, but I wouldn't pay more than the three dollars or so a box (of six) that Wal Mart or Target charges. So a box of 24 should really be about $12. Even at grocery store prices, we would be talking about $16...we'll see how they're priced when they come in! TL;DR Yummy, Addictive Bar...Can I Afford It?"
"I just received this coffee in the mail approximately 15 minutes ago.  Since we have been out of coffee for a whole day, I promptly pulled out my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS"">Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> and made a cup.  When I saw the nice froth after pressing the coffee, I knew it was going to be good.  I didn't expect it to be the best cup of coffee I have had since my trip to Phil'z of San Francisco which, in my opinion, is the best coffee in the world.  At this point in time, I am willing to rank this Kona Blend as number two on my all time list of great coffee.  The coffee is smooth, mellow and lacking a bitter aftertaste (the AeroPress probably helps with that).  The beans appeared fresh and were very aromatic.  I will certainly be maintaining my 'subscribe and save' status.<br /><br />After reading the previous reviews, there are two ways in which I can conceive this coffee tasting like Folger's:<br />1) The coffee was old when the reviewer received it.  I've been ordering Boyer's coffee for a while and I've never had this happen, but I am sure it is possible.<br />2) The reviewer used a drip coffee pot.  If you are picky about coffee, do your taste buds AND the beans a favor and get a better coffee maker.<br /><br />Anyway, that is my opinion.  As a student on a graduate stipend, ~$17 for a 40oz bag of great coffee is definitely worth it. TL;DR Delicious."
"What is not to like, no sugar, no preservatives, all juice.  Like drinking a Granny Smith Apple. TL;DR Lip smacking good"
"A decent, clean, and simple cup of morning decaf. I find pre-wetting the pod helps extract a little extra flavor. TL;DR Decent"
"I have never tasted anything so delicious in my life!  I had always thought that maple cream cookies were the best thing to happen to planet earth, until I tried these.  My Christmas present to myself this year: a box of these cookies and a canister of honey-roasted macadamia nuts.  I think my brains will explode, lol TL;DR To die for!"
"I'm still trying to find a replacement for First Colony French Roast coffee which is now out of business and will continue to try the various coffees that are featured on Amazon.  This one isn't it!<br /><br />The coffee isn't as rich and full-bodied as I would like and adding additional coffee to the coffee maker doesn't seem to make a difference. It's not a bad coffee, but------------  My next try will be the Weaver's which Amazon delivered last week. TL;DR Just an OK coffee"
"I bought a bag for our road trip and everyone just dived into it till it was all gone. Nobody could stop, even those who don't usually like pretzels. It's savory with a hint of sweetness. Yum. TL;DR It tastes soo good!"
"This was one of the best holistic pet food brands on the market. There were many amazing ingredients in this cat food, and it was almost on-par with the other better-than-commercial brands, but not  grain-free. CSftPLS has a few vegetables and grains in it, but it isn't corn-wheat-soy that is so prevalent in commercial brands.<br /><br />Sadly though, because this food is manufactured by Diamond, and the company was involved in a recall in early 2012, I will no longer be purchasing this food for my cat...<br /><br />Full ingredient list:<br /><br />Chicken, chicken meal, cracked pearled barley, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), turkey meal, white rice, potatoes, oatmeal, millet, natural chicken flavor, salmon, turkey, duck, ocean fish meal, flaxseed, sodium bisulfate, egg product, DL-methionine, potassium chloride, choline chloride, dried chicory root, taurine, dried kelp, carrots, peas, apples, tomatoes, blueberries, spinach, dried skim milk, cranberries, rosemary extract, parsley flake, yucca schidigera extract, L-Carnitine, dried Enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried Lactobacillus casei fermentation product and dried Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried Trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, zinc proteinate, vitamin E supplement, niacin, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, copper sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, vitamin A supplement, biotin, potassium iodide, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, manganous oxide, sodium selenite, vitamin D supplement, folic acid TL;DR Another sad story of bad manufacturing..."
My 5 year-old cocakpoo absolutely loves this product. We give her only as a special treat when she follows instructions and/or fetches the ball. All flavors work well. We buy a variety of them and can not detect any preference over a particular flavor. It's pricey but worth the money. TL;DR my dog's favorite treats
"OK, i tried one of Blair's sauces before but i didn't know which one it was, all i knew was that it was the most painful experience that i had ever had and i wanted a bottle of my own, so I picked this one because 550,000 SHU sounded pretty high. alas, this wasn't the right bottle, the flavor is great, and i enjoy it don't get me wrong, this just didn't have me on the floor bent over in agony like the ultra death that I was supposed to buy, but it makes a great additive to just about everything. TL;DR not the right bottle, but still good"
"Maybe I got a bad can, but these escargot tasted off.  They had a distinctly minty taste which is not what normal escargot taste like.  They are very tender and nicely precooked, but oh, the strange aftertaste!  I have another two cans to try and will update this review if they taste normal. TL;DR Is it me, or these escargots?"
This popcorn seasoning is great i love the ranch flavor it makes popcorn taste better<br />the only downside is it won't stick to air popped  popcorn so you have to add something for it to stick to like butter. TL;DR Great Seasoning
"I started with these mints when I quit smoking and the cinnamon flavor was the only thing that helped. They are just strong enough but not over powering.Best little mints on the market, just wish they were still available in the stores TL;DR Best mints"
"So far, my absolute favorite K-Cup flavor...bold and a hint of burnt/bitterness, awesome flavor (even at the large cup size) and bite.  Will put hair on your chest in 5 seconds flat.  If you prefer mild or weaker roasts, stay far, far away.<br /><br />Has become my go-to flavor! TL;DR Not for the Faint of Heart"
"I want to like these k-cups.  Although the flavor is a little on the weak side, I enjoy it.  What I didn't enjoy was the grinds ending up in the cup.  There is something off with the foil on the top of the cups.  A lot of the cups already had grinds on them when I opened the box.  It seemed that I ended up with grinds in the majority of the cups I brewed.  Would like to order again, but not if I have to deal with the same issues. TL;DR grinds in cup"
"Product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. The extreme heat made the oil into a liquid form upon arrival. After letting it sit, it turned back into it's normal consistently. I used for my hair as I transition from a relaxer to a normal state. Haven't used to cook at all. It's a great addiion to my collection of hair products. Natural hairdresser said to use when hair is in natural state ONLY. Do not use when applying heat since the product is a 'heavy'. TL;DR Works well"
I really enjoy mocha coffee drinks from Starbucks and local coffee shops but I do not like the price.  I've tried making it at home and it has never tasted good enough for me to give up the real deal despite the expense.  Now that I have this mocha sauce my trips to the overpriced coffee shops are over!  This is delicious.  I just follow the instructions on the back of the bottle and it makes a wonderful coffee drink for a fraction of the cost.  Love it!  T TL;DR This is sooooo good!
"Popcorn is very delicious.  However, some of the packages have been very oily and thus make grasping them to put in my popcorn maker a task. TL;DR delicious"
"I have family in the Philippines, and having traveled there many times, I know what dried mango is supposed to taste like! Philippine brand comes closest to what I have brought home with me - a sweet, chewy mango that retains the moisture and true flavor of the fresh fruit.  Nothing like what you find in US grocery stores.  They are very sweet(added sugar), so they make a very tasty dessert.  The sulfur dioxide has not been a problem for me; it is a common preservative in many dried fruit products and does not affect the taste. TL;DR Delicious and Good price"
"I gave this flavor to my 6 month old son but he did not like it so I tried to blend it, but still no luck. It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it. TL;DR Give it more then one try"
It is my own fault that I didn't realize I always buy the 18.8 ounce and this is only 10.75 ounce cans. (I've never even seen them in this small of a size). I only buy them on sale so the price per can for the 10.75 ounce is more than I normally buy the 18.8 ounce for.  Amazon will not allow you to return food even though this is cans and was still in the plastic wrap. TL;DR Be sure to check the size
When buying these make sure you have the original Superball by Whamo the other fake ones do not bounce any where near as high.The original molds I was told were destroyed and these are from new molds. TL;DR Be Careful To Buy Only The Original Whamo Superball
"To preface, I have never had Tom Yum soup before so I cannot compare to others, fresh or otherwise. So take this as a review from someone who just wanted to try it.<br />I ordered this because it was on sale and was healthier than many packaged meals.<br />I tried one tonight and added about a dozen small, frozen shrimp. Next time I will also add some frozen veggies as those dehydrated veggies that are included are really not ""wonderful."" I didn't think the preparation was overly difficult and with the frozen shrimp thrown in I did microwave for an additional 30 secs (2 min total).<br />I thought it was quite flavorful and had just a bit of a kick you could feel after finishing. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and plan to use them as meals for work. I do not believe I would pay full price, however. TL;DR Not bad at all"
"In my area, Pounce Crunchy treats are not easily found--especially in larger quantities. I find that giving each of my cats 10-15 of these small treats daily, reduces plaque build up. One of my cats only likes the Catnip flavor, while the other prefers the fish flavors. I would recommend this product over any soft-chewy treat on the market. TL;DR Yummy Favorite"
These chips are amazing. Everyone loves them and they don't last long. It's ideal they come in a 12 pack. TL;DR Delicious!
"I am munching on these chips as I type, trying to keep the salt off my fingers and from going on the keys. I like the way they taste. The flavors are mainly of stone-ground corn, but you can tell there are other ingredients, as well. There's a nice nutty aftertaste. I like texture, too. Just the right amount of crunch.  These chips aren't overly salty, either, another plus.<br /><br />Nutrition-wise, these chips rank among the more healthy versions.  There are only 140 calories in a one ounce serving, a lot less than the normal 200+ I see on similar products, and the amount of fat and sodium is a lot lower, too. It's got 3g of fiber = 11% of an average daily requirement. There are no trans fats cholesterol, preservatives, etc.  It seems that the FoodShouldTasteGood company made a sincere effort to produce as healthy a product as was possible given the ingredients and requirement to make something that tastes good.<br /><br />One reviewer said the chips were too hard and tasted stale.  My own experience was that the chips tasted fresh and were crunchy but by no means any harder or crunchier than a regular tortilla chip.  The expiration date on the bag is in November.  With no preservatives, it seems odd that the bag the other reviewer tried had an expiration date more than a year away.<br /><br />My only hesitation would be the price.  Currently these chips aren't in stock on Amazon and there is no pricing given so I would say you'd have to evaluate whether or not you wanted to pay that much for chips, even though they seem better for your health than other brands and they taste good, as well. TL;DR Tasty Snack"
I have tried other brands but this is the best.  Nice plump snails and taste just like the restaurant kind. TL;DR Great Escargot.
"So far, we have only tried the Acai Lemonade, Pomegranite and the Berry flavor, and I love these little, inexpensive packets that make a delicious and refreshing sugar free drink.  As a diabetic, it is hard to find foods and beverages that are not loaded with sugar or artificial sweetners.  These NOW sugar free drink sticks are small and portable, so I can take them with me into restaurants that have limited choices for people like me.  Just order water and add the packet!  They are also good for children because they are yummy and sugar free.  I feel good about giving this drink to my grandkids.<br /><br />One other reviewer stated that she didn't like the Berry Tea flavor, and everyone in our family agrees with her.  Don't waste your money on the Berry Tea, because it tastes artificial and watered down - no one around here likes it.  The Acai Lemonade if very good, though, and the Pomegranite is positively delicious!  My personal favorite is Pomegranite.  It is pretty, too, and festive looking for a luncheon gathering.  Four little packets will make 1/2 gallon for a group.<br /><br />I did find the powder to be a little difficult to dissolve, but it only takes a few minutes to stir most of it into a glass of water.  I always pour the water into the glass first and then add the powder - otherwise it makes a mess and the powder will never disolve if you pour the drink mix into your glass and add the water last.  It is important to add the powder to an already full glass of water.  I have never gotten ALL of the powder to dissolve and there is always a small bit of residue in the bottom of the glass.<br /><br />The flavor is delicious as long as you don't mix it with more than 16 oz of water.  I hope they will eventually offer this in half gallon size packets, like Kool Aid.  But as I said before, it only takes 4 packets to make a half gallon.<br /><br />This is one of the best finds I have made, and if they keep this level of quality and price, I will keep buying it.<br /><br />UPDATE - 5/25/11: We have now tried the Fruit Punch flavor and do not like it.  We all thought it was really watered down tasting, and had no special flavor that would motivate us to buy it again.  Pomegranite is still the most favorite variety at our house, with Lemonade coming in second.  I will continue to update this review as we get the opportunity to try other flavors. TL;DR This Has Become A Staple At Our House"
"Wouldn't recommend for those who want to try various coffee coffee kcups. These were mostly vanila, hazelnut, choclate and other various flavors but not for those who like their coffee for the original taste. TL;DR Most of the flavors were vanila, hazelnut, etc. not regular coffee cups"
I really liked this columbian coffee. It tasted richer and smoother than the Green Mountain Fair Trade Columbia that I usually purchase. TL;DR Rich and Lively!
"I bought the pod maker w/pods and they work great. Don't need to do an extra fine grind with the perfect pod system, but you may have different results. Already bought the replacement pods from this vendor and they work great too. Buy the 150pk, and you'll save on shipping in the long run. TL;DR Pods work  great!"
"I took this box to a family Christmas exchange, where you played a trading game to get the gift you want.  I thought the ""60's"" people would love it. I had looked through the candy and it had brought back so many memories. However, the ones who wanted it were the ""tweens,"" and the ""teens""! They had so much fun with it and the adults enjoyed sharing their memories. All of the candy was in tact and boxed well. This is a great gift! TL;DR '60's box a hit!"
"These are the same as the ice cube candy bars I remember and just as yummy.  Too yummy!  I am not ordinarily a milk chocolate fan, but for these, I will make an exception!<br /><br />Curses on you, Amazon, for making these treats so delightfully-easy to obtain! TL;DR Addictive!"
"The item itself is in a squeeze pack and that does not work very well with peanut butter. The instructions say to knead the individual package before opening... whatever that means?  I did move the content of the package around before opening.  But so much of it remained in the package when I tried to use it. Effectively I got about a spoon full out of the package and could not squeeze the rest out.  So I opened the package and licked the insides to enjoy the rest.  It got quite messy.  The taste was okay, but not great, and no funny aftertaste of anything. If I tasted it in the store, I would not have purchased it.  I will eat the rest of the squeeze packs, but I have no plans to order them again or recommend them. To others that feel the need to eat this stuff, I would recommend a bottle and specifically not the squeeze pouches.  I also believe it would be too difficult for a child to use at school, even a middle school child.  With normal items such as juice/toothpaste in a squeeze pack, when you squeeze the contents move away and your fingers come very close to each other.  With peanut butter, you squeeze your fingers but the peanut butter does not move towards the top. So it just does not work well.  I wanted to love this stuff -- oh well.<br />---<br />A month later I have come back to re-rate this product.  I have about 13 packs left out of the initial 20.  I hate eating them, it makes a mess, it is hard to use, and the taste is not that great.  I will likely be throwing them out soon.  I do not recommend this product.  And I LOVE chocolate!!!!!!!!!!! TL;DR Taste is okay, squeeze packaging is not recommended"
"I was never a fan of almond butter until I tried Justin's maple almond butter. Not bland, not too mapley, PERFECT. And the squeeze packs are great for portion control. I like to eat this on toast in the morning before class. TL;DR The BEST almond butter out there"
"Having bought into the whole 'Campbells Chicken Noodle' gig since I was a kid, the first time my mom bought me this soup, I ignored it....until one day when I was sick and desperate. Wow! I found it to be a really good soup.<br /><br />The broth is flavorful (but not oily or too rich, either- definitely not watery like certain other canned soups available..), the vegetables are great additions, and the chicken and noodles are very similar to the way my mother used to make them. The noodles were large and firm- unlike some of the soggier canned ones I encountered in my childhood.<br /><br />One thing I really detest is finding pieces of fat in my soup-  the chicken in Progresso's Chicken Noodle Soup is always lean, and the soup has no need to be strained. No fat at all that I could see or taste!<br /><br />It's probably been about 6 years since my mom first bought me this brand of soup- and it's been a consistantly excellent product. Calorically and gastronomically two thumbs up!! TL;DR Just like mom used to make....."
"This package contains a very generous amount of dried leaves, enough to last me quite a while.  They smell awesome and taste even better in my Indian dishes and even spaghetti sauce! TL;DR Great Stuff"
My baby girl truly does love Plum Organics! She lights up when she sees them and finishes ea packet with a lil help (rolling up the tube to get all of the food). Easy for stroller rides or trips in the car. TL;DR My daughter (10 mos old) LOVES them
"I took this product in my iced tea every day after eating something (without eating something first, I got a bad stomach ache and nausea) and the taste was very palatable (with three packets of Stevia in the tea to kind of cover the veggie taste).  After almost two weeks, I noticed I was extremely lethargic - even after ten to twelve hours of sleep - and couldn't think clearly.  I had completely forgotten that years ago I had these same symptoms due to taking a multivitamin with iron in it.  Blood tests at the time showed I had way too much iron in my blood.  I didn't think the 10% iron in this product would bother me but it did.  I stopped taking it a week ago and I guess will just ride things out until my blood levels normalize. I gave the product a high rating because its not the product's fault that I wasn't paying attention to the iron level within it.  If my system didn't retain so much iron, this product would probably have really helped me! TL;DR Too much iron"
"Usually I think gift baskets are hit or miss.  You end up with name brand good items and random other items.  However I think this basket was excellent.  There wasn't a bad thing in here.<br />The basket was the perfect blend savory (cashews) and sweet (godiva chocolates!).<br /><br />Basket:  The basket itself was ok.  it was sturdy and large and reusable so that is good.<br /><br />Packaging:  it was wrapped really well and sent inside a box so no broken items<br /><br />Contents: Godiva Chocolate, Roasted Pistachios, Honey, Olives, Butter Cookies, Almond and Cashew Roca, Cheese Wedge, Chocolate chip cookies, and a bunch of other things.<br /><br />I don't think you could go wrong sending this basket as a gift to someone. TL;DR WOW is an understatement"
"I have dry mouth, and gum chewing really helps.  Sugar-free sweeteners bother my innards, so I've been looking for a gum that doesn't have any sorbitol or xylitol.  Voila!  (Or the Turkish equivalent.)<br /><br />This gum is good quality and lightly flavored.  The individual pieces are a generous size. (What looks like a stick of gum in the picture is actually a pack of 5 pieces.) I understand that this gum has a 25% market share in Turkey.<br /><br />I disagree with a previous reviewer who says that it's like chewing tar.  Some pieces started out kind of chewy, but most didn't, and they all ended up a good consistency in a short time.<br /><br />The shipping bumps up the price considerably when you buy it alone, but the pack I bought will last me for several months and I'm glad it's available. TL;DR Unsweetened gum! No sorbitol, no xylitol, no sugar!"
"For decades I have cooked barley the long way - simmering for almost an hour, watching the pot so it doesn't boil over, scouring the sticky, gooey pot afterwards. I recently gave this product a try and am now a convert. No more long vigils at the stove watching a pot simmer.  This is wonderfully flavorful, full of all the healthy stuff we are looking for, and so much easier to cook, in a lot less time. I used to freeze the long-cooking kind and now I cook batches of this and freeze in smaller portions as well.<br /><br />I have even simmered this quick cooking barley along with whole wheat orzo together in the same pot, drained it and frozen it for future use in soups, stews, etc.<br /><br />Never again will I waste an hour of precious time cooking barley the long way. This quick cooking barley will now become a staple in my cupboard. TL;DR Wonderful, easy, tasty, healthy"
"I use this product as a delicious drink to mix with about any liquid; hot or cold.<br />In addition, since youth in my family, it has ben hailed as a good tonic. TL;DR delicious and versatile"
"i made this as a cake and as muffins, as a cake it tasted good but was VERY sweet so when i made muffins, i used a lot less of the cinnamon/sugar topping and it was MUCH better. Very moist and flavorful! You'll like these but use less crumb topping than instructed! TL;DR yummy but..."
"Nearly tasteless... there is a faint bit of musky saltiness, but no real flavor. The same amount of money will buy enough truffle oil to flavor a dozen dishes.<br /><br />At least the jar is cute! TL;DR Don't waste your time"
"These are all-fruit strips, and actually contains fruit other than apple, which is a plus. The taste, however, is only so-so...nothing to write home about. Clif Fruit Twists are much tastier. These are cheaper, however, which is not surprising. TL;DR Wholesome, but not too tasty"
This is by far my favorite coffee. I have been trying to give other blends a chance but keep coming back to this one. It isn't too dark or too light.. It's perfect. Will continue purchasing this one! TL;DR My favorite coffee
My dog loves these and they work great while training since I use positive training methods. I have a Pit Bull and these treats have made training very easy. TL;DR Green UM Treats
I have a hard time imagining a big market for this product. While it sounded good in theory it has too many negatives to it to be worthwhile.My first complaint is that it tastes like weak koolaid plus leaves an aftertaste that is not thirst quenching at all. Also the size of the bottle combined with the fact that it needs to be refrigerated makes it inconvenient for on-the-go. TL;DR Akin to squeezable koolaid..
Tinkyada Rice Pastas are the best we have found and we are of Italian heritage.  We served it to our guests.  They all say they could not tell it wasn't wheat when we tell them that they had had rice pasta.  It is delicious and works well with Hot & cold dishes. TL;DR The best
"Bought the 3-pack at a local store (I know this the 6-pack but they're all the same, duh). Popped a bag this morning at work and my co-workers didn't like the 'strong' smell. Won't be buying again for this reason.<br /><br />It doesn't taste that bad, but the artificial cheddar flavoring has a characteristic aroma that reminds me of a musty textbook from school (to my nose, that is).<br /><br />IMO Smart Balance is the best choice, especially with their patented blend. Any microwave popcorn isn't suitable for those in need of watching his/her sodium, as they are all high. Just that Smart Balance has the best buttery taste to me.<br /><br />That said, you should take my advice and try it at home--even those where I work don't like the smell of buttery popcorn in the morning.<br /><br />One last note--why don't they have natural flavoring? Common sense--dairy would spoil and make you very sick. Enough said. TL;DR Try at home, not at work"
"I'm very happy that I tried these.  They have a nice cherry flavor, are sweet without being overly so, and don't have high fructose corn syrup or artificial ingredients.  I really enjoy them.<br /><br />I've had both the apple and cherry flavors, and I like them both a lot.  I will certainly be buying them again.  At the current price of about $1.60 a bag using Subscribe and Save, these are a good buy, IMO. TL;DR Delicious, sweet, and organic"
"I have gradually become a berry flavored tea fan over the years. I've done all the store bought ones and they are pretty good. I had never seen this variety before and had been pleased with Stash's high quality product already (they make an amazing Peppermint). The purity and taste of the berry varieties in this sampler box is totally wow. I brew these in a sealed tea container overnight with a cinnamon stick dropped into it. If you want to experience the most delicious taste ever, use only highly purified water (I buy spring water) for your creation. Today's tap water will ruin the experience. Don't do it. One last thing: there is a wonderful book available called ""20,000 Secrets Of Tea"" -- it's a little paperback. A nice little history of tea in general, and then a detailed breakdown of all tea varieties. The healing properties in teas is nothing short of miraculous. High blood pressure, stomach distress, fatigue, headache, urinary distress,...the remedies are in there. Most likely, your doctor is poisoning you with prescriptions that you don't even need (well hey, that's their job!). LOL. This is an awesome deal here by Amazon folks: SIX boxes of these, with 18 bags in each. I've plowed through one whole box already. I'll be back. TL;DR The berry taste is out of this world"
Coming from the east coast I had to settle for second best NO MORE TL;DR great
"This product is very good but expensive as I could buy it<br />somewhere else cheaper. I bought it as I could not find it<br />in some stores here so I ordered it. I found it later for<br />sale at a lower price. I bought 24 boxes and I could have<br />saved a lot if I waited and bought it here. I checked the<br />description of the item to make sure it is the same as the<br />one available here and it is exactly the same. Any one buying<br />it should check first the price in stores where you live and<br />make sure it is whole grain. TL;DR Melba Toast, whole grain"
We love this bread.  I make it in my bread maker and it comes out really nice.  I slice it up and freeze it<br />so it is ready when we want a slice or two. TL;DR Love it
"Loved this, my coffee right now, i have different names of coffee to brew but i settle for this one and i don't get tired of its flavor.  Great for a gift. TL;DR great taste"
"I've been curious about these little bottles for a while now, since water can sometimes get a bit boring and I try to avoid soda. When I saw the opportunity to try them as a Vine member, I was excited!<br /><br />They're definitely convenient little objects, and if you really wanted to, you could fit one in your purse to carry with you. The way it works is you're supposed to squeeze in a drop at a time until you've reached the flavor you want. Firstly, there are no drops. I had to squeeze the thing with a kung fu grip before anything came out, and when it did, it shot out in a little jet stream. I tried a couple of times, but couldn't get it to just drip. That said, it takes far more than a few drops to get any flavor! I ended up putting in a teaspoon or so before the color was finally tea-like and there was some sort of flavor. The flavor was seriously watered down, like a super weak glass of iced tea.<br /><br />Both my cousin and I tried the sweet tea MIO, and we were both rather disgusted by the flavor. Hopefully the other flavors are better! TL;DR Seriously disappointed!"
This product is OK. I have tatsted better but this is doable. It's best with juice. TL;DR It's OK
"-- Update --<br />Sadly, though, two of the stalks did not recover, so I had to remove them. I am still hoping though, so I transferred them to a different container and cut out all the dead parts. We'll see how it works.<br /><br />The one stalk did recover, but most of its leaves are limp and dying so I had to remove them. So right now, it's more of a stick with a little stump of a leaf bud, but I have not seen any signs of degradation to its health. I read that it takes longer for these plants to leaf up so I'm just going to watch closely. As of now, I can say it's recovering.<br />------------------<br /><br />Shipment came pretty quick. The plant was stuffed in a bunch of packing peanuts, with the roots soaked in plant gel (to keep the plant hydrated).<br /><br />I have to admit the plant looked a bit sad coming from the box, but considering it traveled from west to midwest, it's expected. It didn't look like it's dying, though, just a bit limp, the roots look healthy so I'm pretty sure it'd bounce back in a week or so.<br /><br />The vase it came with though was a bit too tiny for my taste. But I can just get a bigger one when my bamboo grows (pretty sure the bamboo will topple the vase over when it starts growing top heavy. TL;DR Not bad for a plant that traveled across the distance"
"This almond flour makes for really nice results in gluten free baking. Love it.  Make bread, muffins, pancakes, biscuits.  All nice.  Nice recipes located at [...]  Enjoy.  Oh, good price too.  Lots of protein, low carb compared to wheat or other gluten free flours.  And, yup, it has flavor folks. TL;DR Go Nuts"
"BROWN SUGAR CINNAMON POP TARTS<br /><br />Why, oh, why is it so hard to find this flavor of pop tart?  And why do stores only stock the frosted brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts?<br /><br />I have been a fan of this flavor pop tarts since they were first invented which was a looong time ago.  Nothing beats sticking these into the toaster, just getting them a little bit warm, and then spreading a very thin portion of butter on them.  Serve with ice cold milk -- skim, of course -- and you are in for a taste treat!  Your taste buds will thank you.<br /><br />I only wish more grocery stores would stock the au natural brown sugar flavor.  Frosting isn't everything!<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Pam TL;DR MY FAVORITE POP TARTS IN THE WORLD"
"This curry is mild to medium-hot, and not real thick (not really watery, just not thick).  The vegetables are mashed to almost smooth.  It's very good to pour over rice or as a topping for meat.  I bought it to take to work for a quick lunch, and it suits.  The only drawback is the packaging.  The inner pouch isn't microwaveable, so the product must be squeezed out into a bowl before heating (it tends to cling to the pouch a little, too). TL;DR Good product, but not packaged for microwave."
"I love a good pancake or waffle once in a while so when I saw Bob's Gluten Free Pancake Mix I was anxious to try it. As usual for Bob's it was easy to prepare and made really nice looking pancakes but when I put them in my mouth they seemed to just sit there, not fluffy at all, and so dense and with a slightly weird off-flavor that I had to put extra butter and maple syrup on them just to get them down. Keep working on this one Bob. TL;DR Too Dense"
"I am a great fan of potato chips and of Thai food.  I was so happy when Kettle Chips decided to meld two of my great loves together! (What a concept.....)  These chips are spicy enough, without burning a hole in your tongue.  Also, they have a nice hint of sweetness that makes them habit forming (careful!).  Once in a while, this is a treat definitely worth indulging in. TL;DR great (hot) new flavor...."
"Although I got it for my kids, when got the package and after reading (Made in the same facility with tree nuts, peanuts and soy) I was worried of giving it to my allergic child. He tried it but didn't really like it. But guess what I like it lol :) so its my favorite cereal now :) You cannot compare it to Cherrios and you shouldn't. Its organic, no weird ingredients at all, all natural and taste great with either rice milk, coconut milk or plain (organic of course from grass fed cows) milk!!! Enjoy! TL;DR I like it a lot!"
"Very excited to find this product.  Item was packed well, wrapped as a case inside a fitting box.  Unfortunately, 8 of the 12 cans were very dented.  There was no apparent damage to the box in which it was shipped leading me to believe it was packed that way.  Damage to the cans were random throughout the case not just the outside.  But alas, I have toast waiting... TL;DR Yay beans for toast - 8 of 12 severly dented"
"I was really excited to try this, got the box, and started reading it. It Says Decaffeinated arabica coffee under ingredients on the bottom. SO DISAPPOINTED! It doesnt indiciate that ANYWHERE and I would NOT have bought it had I known it was decaff! TL;DR DECAFF - Not what I wanted"
This is suppose to be sweet paprika but it is HOT. I runed my Bar-B-Q because I thought this was sweet and used it as I would if it was sweet. the information on the can is misleading. TL;DR wrong information
These are amazing food markers... write beautifully and flawlessly with true vivid color. Makes you look like a professional baker! LOVE THEM! Did fine red stitching on fondant baseballs and they were phenomenal... don't waste your money on other markers that smear... these are fabulous! TL;DR Awesome markers
"I like sardines, particularly sardines smoked and packed in olive oil. Sardines are available without being smoked, in a ketchup sauce, in mustard, and packed in a non-descript vegetable oil.<br /><br />Reese's have proven, over the last several years, to be a consistently high quality product. They fare well, even when placed against the best of competing brands like King Oscar. TL;DR Five Stars, Every Time"
This is really good. I like it much better then their flavors with all that sugar. TL;DR Great Stuff
"This product should have been called ""Cajun Salt"" because it is mostly salt crystals with a little spice mixed in. If you want to control your own salt content and get more flavor, get the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00356JU5C"">Louisiana Fish Fry Products Cajun Blackened Seasoning</a> instead. Loved that one from the same company. TL;DR TOO SALTY"
"For many years, I fed my now 10 year old long haired male cat a mainstream brand of cat food that I believed was high quality.  Over the past couple of years my cat started having stomach problems and was throwing up excessively...to the point of needing to be rehydrated at the vet at least once a year.  I tried canned wet food but it made the problem even worse.  Every time my vet would simply recommend a sensitive stomach dry food but it never worked long term. We were caught in a terrible cycle and I felt awful for my poor cat!<br />After doing some research on my own, I determined that my cat may have a grain sensitivity.  I decided to try a limited ingredient diet and chose Natural Balance (salmon and pea).  After 3 months on Natural Balance, it is like I have a different cat!  Immediately, he enjoyed the food so no issue there.  His coat improved after 1 month and it is so shiny and smooth.  He has not gotten sick once except for the occasional hair ball, which is even less frequent now (1 every 2 weeks).  We have started supplementing with NB LID wet canned food and he loves it as well!<br />I cannot say enough about this wonderful food.  If you have a cat struggling with tummy problems, give this a try!  It solved our problems AND I feel great about feeding him this high quality, nutritious food. TL;DR The perfect food for my cat"
"This is my 2nd Order of Island Blend.  I had used another brand for years so it took a few days to get used to a new taste, but its just fine. The envelopes are easy to tear open and very convenient. TL;DR Good Coffee at Good Price"
"Honestly, these are fantastic, closest thing to Grandma's recipe ever! I have been buying from this company for years, I have sent them all over the US and even to Afghanistan to my nephew's troops and they arrived like right out of the oven. Great treat for anyone with discerning taste in baked goods, you can't go wrong! OVC07711 TL;DR Melt in your mouth!"
"title says it all:good, spicy jalap taste w/ a slight heat to it;creamy texture stays in place better than salsa, too. i dug this more than the ranchero flavor. works great on tacos, salad, soup topper, baked potatoes, etc. good all-around condiment! TL;DR great balance of spiciness,creamy texture,and don't need to use much"
"I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, it's not fried nor baked.<br /><br />However, even though it is advertised as being ""healthy"" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldn't get into these chips.<br /><br />I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor. I personally enjoy chips where I can taste some potato as well. TL;DR Not as good as I was lead to believe"
"My cat Foutchie is heading toward 5 now and no one told her the trouble with a kitten is it eventually becomes a cat (so take that Ogden Nash!).  She still voom-voom-vooms around at a pace that makes me exhausted.  She loves toys, especially stuff she chases.  So the bubbles are great full.  Especially since they are catnip bubbles.  You don't have the worry about them getting soap on them and making them sick.  She love jumping high to pop them.<p>So if you are looking for something to awaken the kitten in your kitty, you might try these. TL;DR Foutchie approved!!"
"I have one of the pickiest dogs.  He dislikes everything.  The only things he eats are people food..........but not anymore!  He loves this.  I give it to him as a snack too and he can't get enough of it.  I notice that his coat is shinier since he has been eating this. TL;DR Natural Balance Beef and Rice Formula Dog Food Roll, 4-Pound"
"This product was just what we were looking for. My wife loves making dolmas, and I love eating them so...it worked out Great! So, Thank You. TL;DR Just what we were looking for."
Tasted like a couple of pieces of toast.  Anyone who likes bagels should stay away from these. TL;DR bread not bagel
"I purchased this item at the super market at Halloween time.  They are very flavorful soft, chewy treats. Similar to Gummi Bears but they have a juicy center and intense flavor. I went back to buy more because my teen age grandson loves them and they were all gone. Much to my chagrin they are only available in my area for Halloween. They make great snacks for children and adults. TL;DR Delightful"
"Please don't buy these for your dog. These have artificial colors and pork in them that is not listed on the product description online. These made my dog very ill. He had diarrhea and was throwing up for a week. I was very worried about him. This was the only change in his diet, I feed him all natural food with no artificial anything. I thought these were made of chicken & natural accourding to the online description but they are not. TL;DR Dingo Munchy Stix made my dog very sick"
"The service was excellent from Amazon,it always is. I compare other companies to Amazon.  Amazon has set the level of customer service, and quickness to such a high level, extremely hard to beat. Nine out of ten times I always shop at Amazon not only are they quicker, but they also have everything for less expensive price. No shipping if you sign up for prime time once a year.Love them can you tell  !!!!As far as the coffee I preferred Green Mountain my choice, over Gloria Jeans Hazelnut. TL;DR gloria jeans hazelnut k-cups"
THis product is a cheap candy ($3) three dollar candy sold for 27 bucks.  dont waste tour money or time TL;DR WORTHLESS - NO GOOD
"We like these Mrs. May's Trio Natural Bars. These are a little on the chewy, sticky side, so beware, if you have dental problems (chew carefully). Packaged in an almost indestructible cello package. The ingredients are as follows: Cashews, Almonds, Pistachios, Fruit (Cranberries or Strawberries or Blueberries or Tropical-Pineapple, Mango, Papaya), Sesame Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Pumpkin Seeds, Dates, Raisins, Rice Malt, Natural Flavors, Cane Juice, Sea Salt. That's it! There are 20 bars in a 24 oz or 700 gram box. Each bar is 1.2 oz or 35 grams. The box says: vegan/no trans fat/no additives/no preservatives/no cholesterol/gluten free/diary free/wheat free/non-GMO/kosher and product of China (that worries me more than a little). Calories 170 each, 100 calories from fat, 12 grams total fat, 1.5 grams saturated fat, 0mg cholesterol, 45mg sodium, 14g total carbohydrate, 2g dietary fiber, 6g sugar, 5g protein, 2/4% calcium, 8% iron, 0% vitamins A & C. Yummy flavor, can taste the nuts and fruit, not too sweet for most people, certainly a lot less sweet than any other granola/snack/breakfast/protein type bar we've tried. Wish they were bigger, pretty small. Otherwise, very good bars.  Nice having 5 bars of each flavor all in one box! TL;DR Very Good!"
"Easily makes great beignets! Plus I was surprised to find it made more than I expected even though I like my beignets somewhat doughy. I roll my dough out a little less to have thicker dough.<br />If you have not made these before, to make them puff you have to hold them under the oil for a few seconds. After you drop them in and they start to rise to the top, just use something to hold them just under the oil. It usually takes just a second or so and you will see the dough start to expand. Then just let them go and let them finish cooking. Flip to cook both sides if necessary. TL;DR Oh so good!!!"
"This is a very good salmon product.  It is not smoked, so you are not losing the good omega 3 oil.  I find it works well with a bagel and cream cheese-package makes about 3 of these. It is well sealed and apparently lasts foreveer. TL;DR SeaBear"
"This tea is OK, but the fruity flavors were very strong. It was more like fruit tea than green tea. I prefer my tea hot, but (as the other reviewer suggested) this may make a better iced tea. If you like strong fruity flavors in your tea, you will probably enjoy this. TL;DR OK, not as good as I'd hoped for"
"Purchased this with the Tom Yum and Udon. Avoid...doesn't taste like chicken, really salty and almost unpalatable. TL;DR Avoid the Chicken"
"If you're pressed for time and want something that's easy to prepare, filling, and that the kids will eat, this should suit just fine. I wouldn't eat just this for a meal, though, due to the high fat content.<br /><br />We (two adults and three kids) had this for dinner a few days ago, and my wife said it was very easy to prepare. She mentioned that a few times, actually. This makes a good amount of food when prepared according to the package directions. The package indicates enough for about five people, and that's about right. There was more than enough to go around, plus leftovers, although we didn't eat this exclusively for the meal.<br /><br />Most of the family liked it. The flavor was good, and it went down very easy. There was a surprising amount of cheese, enough so that I think in addition to the ground beef you could add additional things like chopped onion, bell pepper, or whatever, and make quite a nice dish out of it. I ate some cold leftovers with lunch the next day, and it tasted just fine.<br /><br />My only gripe is the same thing I have with other cheese-type products: it's very high in fat, and therefore felt rather greasy, and sat a little heavy in my stomach. According to the box, one serving as prepared gives you 25% of the recommended daily fat intake. Because of this, given a choice this isn't a food product I'd eat on its own. Rather, I'd have this along with a small salad, fruit, etc. I'd really like it if instead of having the cheese sauce pre-made in a pouch, they provided a powder (similar to mac-and-cheese) so I can prepare the cheese sauce how I like it. TL;DR Tasty and good for a quick meal"
"We bought the one cup thinking it was the perfect thing to brew coffee for my in-laws and herbal tea and apple cider for the rest of us.  But after brewing a few cups of coffee, it makes everything taste like coffee.  Mechanically it is working fine after two months. TL;DR Not for mixed use"
"I have eaten alot of bars lately, and these are the best. They were a little hard to find locally at first, but ahhhaahhh Publix has them for 2 for $3.00, not bad huh? Also from now til 12-31-10 thinkthin has a coupon you can use (print alot of copies ;)) for 50 cents off a single purchase. AND NO SUGAR!!!! I feel like I'm eating a chocolate cnady bar but I dont feel as guilty afterwards. These chocolate brownie one is good too, but nothing like these white chocolate bars. Thanks think thin!!!! TL;DR Best diet bars out there!!!"
Just wanted to say they taste just like I remember them as a kid.  They are Grrrreeeaaaattttt!!!! TL;DR Kellogg's Frosted Rice Krispies
"My son loves it. I think it's his favorite out of the three brands of baby food we've tried. You can't beat the packaging, very convenient. TL;DR Pass The Test!"
"This is good loose leaf tea and the packaging makes this tea a very good purchase. There are three packages so while using one the other two stay fresh, the package has a zip lock thing to help preserve freshness and the bottome is fasioned so that it can stand up like in the picture. The tea itself is very good, but you must remember that this is Jasmine green tea... All in all I am happy with the purchase. TL;DR Good tea."
"These are some of the best olives I have ever tasted! I purchased them recently from Gristede's and literally had to go back two days later for another jar. The olives are big, yummy, perfectly brined, not too salty queen olives in a smooth, dry vermouth that yes - gave me a bit of a buzz even before I mixed it with gin to create a tasty martini. The only thing that kept me from clearing the supermarket shelf of these olives was the cost - in store they're $6.99 and it was a good distance from my Brooklyn address. I took it as a sign that the Universe was trying to help me manage my olive addiction. I almost opened the second jar on the subway - I need help and olive lovers you need to try these olives. TL;DR Yummy yummy Olives!!!"
"I have used this seasoning for grilled veggies, soups, stir fry, cole slaw, etc. for several years and it is THE BEST. I haven't been able to find it in the local stores recently, so that is why I ordered it from Amazon.  It's called Salt-Free 17 because it jazzes up the dish so you don't have to use salt and pepper. It is also great added to melted butter and served on a saucer for dipping bread. All the ingredients (except for citric acid and corn starch) are chopped herbs, veggies, lemon peel, orange peel, and toasted sesame seeds. It has NO MSG. TL;DR Best seasoning for grilled veggies, stir fry, soups, etc."
"I think this is a good product, but my cats do not like it as much as the chicken flavor.  But otherwise, Liv-a-Littles are a hit. TL;DR Good, but not as good as Chicken."
"Snapea Crisps do taste slightly like ground peas -- delicious!  They are crispy, like potato chips, but better for you.  I found a bag of these in a Trader Joe's while on a cross country trip.  They were so good, and healthy too, that I had to find more.  Amazon is a great source for anything you need!  It saved me from running from store to store. TL;DR Great Snack!"
"I got my kitten through a rescue group when he was about 7 months old. He had been a stray and was very thin, had bad breath, diarrhea, poor coat and missing hair on his ears. He has been on this Natural Balance dry food for the last seven months or so and he's now a very healthy 14 pounds, has a gorgeous shiny coat, no diarrhea, his breath is good and has a great energy level. It's hard to believe he's the same cat. I'm very happy with this food and so is he. He loves the taste and never gets tired of it. Yes, it's a little more costly than buying the generic brand of cat food at the grocery store but I save on vet bills because my cat is never sick. I have tried other brands of food, but he prefers the taste of this one and I'm happy he's doing so well on it. TL;DR Healthy and high quality food that my cat loves"
"I found this product very difficult and annoying to install. The included length of aluminum wire is quite stiff, which makes threading the PVC pipes annoying. Far more disturbing is the amount of aluminum that transferred from the wire to my hands during the installation.<br /><br />At first I thought this wasn't working - I'd left the Havahart live trap out and baited even after installing the fence as an added security measure, but when I released the groundhog I'd caught into the yard and it ran through the fence (brushing solidly against the wire) it didn't look like it was affected. Suspicious, I touched the wire... it produced barely a tingle. I checked the light, and sure enough - it was blinking merrily (the manual says that blinking is an indication of proper working order).<br /><br />So I began thumbing through the manual and came to the page talking about the two-wire design for operating in areas with dry ground. Unfortunately, that design won't work on groundhogs because they slink along the ground (the animal would have to touch both wires), so that was a bust. I decided to check the ground rod to see if the ground here is simply too dry and found the rod nice and moist from our deep clay soil. Giving up in disgust, I went inside to post a one-star-in-lieu-of-zero review when I had a revelation - groundhogs don't wear thick, rubber-soled shoes.<br /><br />Works well enough once you take your shoes off, but it gets only three stars because of the annoying setup. TL;DR It works, but it's a pain to set up!"
"I was a little skeptical about trying this tea thinking that it probably wouldnt work but after eating some really junky food (the fiance is on prednisone and we have been eating absolute junk) amd seeing the scale soar up seven lbs fully knowing that i was really backed up and enemas not taking care of much i figured why not. I steeped for 10 minutes and was suprised that the taste wasnt too bad. Well... I havr issues going in the morning and i will not poo at work so nearly 19 hrs after drinking this.. I came home and sat down and in about 2 seconds something slid. Now i thought it would be not much because of the duration so when i checked... ""holy ****"" was what i said.i had gone More than ive ever gone in my life.even with the stomache flu! That being said the scale is showing im down at least 4 lbs... So this tea really worked for me TL;DR holy crap"
"This stuff is truly a miracle.  My husband has had problems with his shoulder for years.  He regularly takes tramadol for pain, which makes him drowsy and not able to function.  He started on the ACV 10 days ago.  He has very minor shoulder pain now and has not taken a pain pill since he started.  He was able to put his arm on the pew in church yesterday, for the first time in many years.  He says his shoulder has only a minor ache, nothing like the severe pain he was suffering. He will continue on the ACV. TL;DR Miracle Worker"
"The are great granola bars. I've bought them for a long time and continue to love them. The almonds in them are a great touch, and they're sweetened by dried cranberries. There's also enough there to make it filling for a small snack.<br /><br />Consistency-wise, they are a bit sticky. I usually hold them with the wrapper when I eat them. They are definitely chewy (especially as compare to the Nature Valley crunchy granola bars, which are really, really crunchy), but because of all the nuts and crispy things, they're still a bit crispy. I like the consistency and have no prob with it as others have said they do. I also don't find them too crazy sweet (I tend not to like super-sweet things). The nuts and slight bitterness of the cranberries balance it all out for me.<br /><br />Again, I've always loved these granola bars. Give them a try. TL;DR Like granola bars? You'll prob like these."
"There are some wonderful olives in the mix that cling to the pit and others are a bit mushy that slide off the pit. I prefer the former. I culled the soggy olives for making Pasta Putanesca while using my favorites in Antipasto. So all in all, it is still a tasty and likeable mix that I'd purchase again. TL;DR Tasty and Likeable BUT..."
"I was disappointed to find that the Beans came Whole.  Since I don't own a fancy Coffee machine like French snobs or a fancy grinder, I didn't know how to use them.  I tried to smash them with a hammer but they were inconsistent.  When I did manage to borrow a grinder from a homeless man, I found that the Coffee tasted like poo. TL;DR Whole Bean?"
I love cherry lifesavers and am so thankful to be able to find them here.  I don't know why they don't sell these in the store.  Now I have my favorite lifesavers for quite awhile!! TL;DR yum
"I can't weigh in on whether this is true ""matcha"", but in the Starbucks sense of the word, it makes a matcha latte which is just fine and I have enjoyed it this way every day a while now.<br /><br />Recently, I must admit, someone gave me some quality matcha from Korea (maybe this is the REAL kind) which I used for matcha latte, and the flavor is much richer, the color is darker, and the powder mixes up smoother.  The product for sale here leaves me some teeny clumps at the bottom no matter how well I try to mix it.  When I just taste the dry powder, I can taste the bitterness of this product, whereas the better stuff was not bitter.<br /><br />But the price is good and it's still worth what I spent.<br /><br />Update:  I bought a bigger package of ""green tea powder"" from an international grocery as another reviewer suggested.  However, the flavor is bitter, and much weaker - I use twice as much powder per cup and it's still not as flavorful, and it's more bitter so I have to add sweetener when I didn't with this product.<br /><br />Also, I found out that I can avoid the teeny clumps with this product if I pour my powder through a tea strainer before I mix it with the hot water. TL;DR Worthy matcha latte"
"I bought two orders of these chocolates and planned to share them with holiday guests. After receiving them, I'm not sure I bought enough. I shared a few pieces.<br />The rest are squirreled away for safe keeping, for those days when personal therapy of the dark chocolate kind is called for. Such smooth and intense gourmet chocolate taste! TL;DR Sinfully wonderful!"
"I love Silk Very Vanilla Soymilk in the large cartons, and I was so happy when I was browsing through Amazon and came across these individual 8-ounce containers I just had to order them. The delivery was on time and I immediately put them in the fridge. They taste just like the large cartons sold in grocery stores and come in cute little containers. I will definitely re-order these! TL;DR So Convenient!"
"avocado in color i expected as much in taste, and i was not disappointed.  afterwards, reading the ingredients on the label i did not see avocado.  maybe I was tasting the soy oil.  cheddar cheese is listed, and on subsequent tastings i did taste the cheese.  lana did not taste cheese, though she admitted to a vegetable flavor.  the jalapeno flavor comes through without too much bite, both lana and i agree on this.  i did not shake the bottle as i used the sauce.  the peppers settle at the bottom of the bottle so my suggestion is do not shake the bottle if you enjoy a spicer, that is, a hotter, sauce.<br /><br />i am not a fan of tacos, however i do enjoy a good sauce, and i seasoned several dishes from vegetables to pork chops and was never disappointed.  this is a sauce i highly recommend.<br /><br />a favorite dish.  broiled salmon, covered in olive oil and sprinkled with powdered red pepper.  cook until the fish is slightly browned.  remove from oven and pour on the bold and creamy jalapeno sauce.  serve with mixed vegetables, and a glass of zinfandel. TL;DR green cheese"
This Product Is the only healthy Snack food that tastes good. This is so heathy I can eat the entire bag and it is only 330 cal. Even a bag of lite butter microwave popcorn has more calories. TL;DR Smart healthy fries
"Old, dry beans.  I was not impressed.  After hearing people rave about these beans, I was looking forward to my first cup of espresso using them.  What a let down. TL;DR Not impressed."
"the chocolate arrives fast enough, regretably this is the only thing good about this purchase.<br /><br />condition is bad.  pieces are smallish and many look chipped and rough, probably due to the transportation process.  some are wrapped in cheap looking red and green foils.  they also taste a bit stale.  i don't know how long they have stayed in the warehouse.<br /><br />taste is disappointing.  predominate taste is sugar--with a gritty texture, not the smooth, rich taste expected of a luxury chocolate.<br /><br />two thumbs down.  not worth the money at all. TL;DR disappointed"
"This cereal tastes great.  The colors aren't quite as bold as what is shown on the box, but it uses natural food colorings, so I could really care less.  I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars only cause it's so expensive and the box is a little bit smaller than a normal cereal box.  If it were bigger or less expensive, I would have given it 5 stars.  But otherwise it tastes great.  Also, I ordered this and it's supposed to be 5 boxes of cereal in the order, I only received 1 box.  I contacted Amazon and they actually overnighted me a whole new shipment of 5 boxes, that arrived on a Saturday morning.  Great customer service! Thanks! TL;DR Great gluten free subsitute for Fruit Loops"
"These are very good, but overpriced.  I paid $10.49.  Way too much.  Even the current price of $5.95 seems too much.  The price tag on the product reads $4.43 TL;DR I paid $10.49 for these.  Way too pricey, but tastey"
Does not cut nails cleanly.  There is a gap between the blade and the backing plate that crushes the nail instead of cutting it.  I tried every angle and orientation but it just does not cut the dogs nails.  I am returning the product as it does not work at all. TL;DR Don't buy
"i was recently diagnosed w/ gestational diabetes... thus began my quest for a yummy protein bar... this isn't it. i'm giving it 2 stars because my blood sugar levels were within the desired range after having it as a snack. i'm going to try the other flavors, but this one definitely is not one i'd like to have again. TL;DR meh"
These products were terrible tasting. My husband is Indian and said the taste was terrible. I agreed. When I went to return the unopened packages I could not so so. They have a no return policy. Now I will have to toss out $40 worth of unused product. Amazon is always so very good about returns but evententaly some of their vendors are not. TL;DR BUYER BEWARE--NO RETURNS
Best chocolate spread EVER! If you need a pick me up toast a croissant and spread some of this on!!! Coffee along side this snack is extra yum! TL;DR yum!
"We bought this toy for our little labradoodle.  Within an hour he had torn the cover to shreds, the stuffing was all over the floor and the thing was absolutely destroyed.  :-( TL;DR Not at all Tuff"
My dogs eat nothing but Halo brand dog food because it has all REAL ingredients and they love it!  The treats and chews are just icing on the cake for them.  It's their favorite!  I know they love it and that it's good for them so I can feel good about feeding them Halo! TL;DR Halo is the best!
"Usually my cats love Tiki Cat, but after buying this batch, they threw up each time they ate it.  I am worried it is a tainted batch and I may be poisoning them!  Be careful when buying from this seller TL;DR My cats are vomiting - tainted product?"
"This product is the best meal replacement drink I have seen to date.  I keep waiting for other products to catch up to them, but so far they haven't.<br /><br />The main difference between this meal replacement and other meal replacement products I've seen is in the carbohydrates they provide.  Most other meal replacements I've seen either use sugars or maltodextrin as their main carbohydrate.  The problem with this is that they have a high glycemic index.  This means that when you eat them, your blood sugar rapidly rises and your body responds by making a lot of insulin.  Then in a very short time, your blood sugar is low and you have no energy and are hungry again.  This product is low sugar and no maltodextrin which is great.  Hopefully it has a low glycemic index.<br /><br />The oil blend is this product looks to be good.  They don't report the exact percentages of omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids but they do contain omega fatty acids.<br /><br />As for the protein, it's a blended protein that's 40 grams per serving.<br /><br />In my opinion, the taste of these products is great, but that's only an opinion.  Concerning the nutritional value of this product, everything I've said here is easy to validate with a little research.<br /><br />The only downfall of this product is the cost.  It's a lot cheaper to just blend protein powder, oatmeal and Udo's oil in a blender, but that obviously isn't nearly as convienent.  All in all, this is a great product, but be sure to shop around because the price can vary greatly. TL;DR No Maltodextrin!!!"
"These taste really good, the only problem I had was the wrapping they are in foil and it sticks to the chocolate and causes the candy to break open leaking the liquor all over your hands. TL;DR good"
"These are excellent.  I am a St Louis native (but now reside in Virgina) and have been a customer of Bissinger's Chocolate for over 20 years.  I have never had better quality chocolate (okay I have had some amazing Swiss chocolate).  All their products are excellent, we really love the black sesame crunch, especially my Arabic husband, who may be a little bit of a sesame seed snob.  Did I mention this is GLUTEN FREE!!!  Bissinger's web site specifies gluten free on many items.  The service from Bissinger's is truly 5 star. TL;DR Black sesame"
Have used this for years.  Gives long lasting energy boost with no sudden let down. Good taste.  4 oz ea. so can put them in  my carry-on when traveling. TL;DR ZipFizz liquid energy shot
"Be aware that if you think you're going to get ""Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Gourmet Single Cup Milk Chocolate Hot Chocolate, 16 K-Cup box - (Pack of 2 boxes)"", you won't!!!  Liquid Nation sends out Cafe Express Milk Chocolate Hot Chocolate and doesn't tell you they are going to substitute...then when you contact them about it, they tell you Green Mountain is being phased out and replaced with Cafe Express ... and they don't care if you're unhappy about the switch! TL;DR You don't get what you order"
The bars are delicious!  They are moist and I can't keep them in the house.  Once the package is open it's gone! TL;DR barbara's bars
These are great and amazingly lacking in added ingredients.  Crispy like a fried chip but they are not fried. Not dried or chewy like some dehydrated apples.  I love all the flavors but the beet is my favorite.  I hope they get the veggie variety on Amazon soon. TL;DR Excellent
"To be honest, I didn't want to like this formula. I was having gas and spit-up issues with Enfamil Newborn and our pediatrician recommended this for our 2 week old son. When I read the ingredients and saw that the first one is corn syrup, I balked and purchased a three pack of Baby's Only Organic from Amazon, hoping it would work for us. It made my baby terribly constipated. So I bought the Target brand Gentle formula which is supposed to be comparable to this. It is, but we were still getting spit ups. I switched to a mix of Enfamil Newborn and Enfamil AR. Back to horrible, screaming gas issues. Finally, reluctantly, I had to admit that of the four things we'd tried, this is the best for us. I bought the brand name because the Target brand smelled like malt mix and doesn't mix well. There is really no difference between Enfamil and Target other than the smell and color. Enfamil doesn't mix well either. Both give my son horrible green swamp poops which are runny and explosive. But apparently that's normal with the gentle formulas. Yuk.<br /><br />My son does better on this. I suspect he has lactose sensitivities and this, while not really cutting down on the gas, helps him to pass it and not scream in pain all day. He sleeps well and eats without pain. While I would like him to eat something that doesn't make his diapers so nasty, it's worth it. Plus, we use cloth diapers so the poop doesn't explode out of the diaper and onto his clothes. It does make for some very interesting diaper changes.<br /><br />I'm still not completely settled on this, but I have a two month supply so we are on it for now. I just wish I could find something that would agree with him without the gross diapers and less than ideal ingredients.<br /><br />Update:  I switched to Baby's Only LactoRelief and saw a HUGE improvement in reflux symptoms in just 1 feed!  His stools improved drastically and he is a new baby!  I have come to believe that it was not reflux at all. TL;DR There are better options"
"Should really give this product a below zero review, but there's no choice about that. The first bite is okay, but after eating the whole sandwhich, I realized that my stomach wants to turn upside down, and the after taste is so terrible that I wanted to puke all the food I've eaten. It taste so yukky and horrible that it would not go away for awhile even though I gargle and drink lots of liquid. I wonder if there's a food poisoning in here. Will never ever buy this canned food again!!! TL;DR Taste Like Acid"
"I ripped open one of the bags and popped a few pieces into my mouth, and was appalled at how they tasted. They were not what I remembered! I cracked open one of the pieces to find that the peanut inside had white spots on it, which may or may not have been mold. I looked for an expiration date and instead found a code: 2167CX. After some research I found that the first digit indicates the year of production. I was horrified. This candy was made in 2002! Steer clear of Farley's and Sathers candy on this site unless you like 9+ year old candy! TL;DR They don't age quite as well as fine wine..."
Tasty way to refuel after kicking a** at the gym. Most protein drinks have a chalky taste to them that I can't stand but not Muscle Milk. Chocolate is the best flavor available. TL;DR Tasty!
"my black lab loves these treats!! they are a little pricy for the amount you get, i would like to see more product for the price. TL;DR trooper's favorite treat"
"My dog loves these treats but I found that this company charges way too much for this item.  I usually get the same size jar for $9.99 at BJ's, they were out of them for a few weeks and I thought they weren't going to get them so I ordered them from here...for 25.00...didn't realize the cost was so much higher, thought it was a bigger jar than I usually get but it wasn't.  Way overpriced in my opinion. TL;DR Dog Loves them but Cost is Way too high"
"...and has lots of stuff in it.  If you want something good w/o many calories that has good taste buy this.  The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQBZO2"">Healthy Choice Chicken with Rice Soup, 14-Ounce Microwave Bowls (Pack of 12)</a> tastes like a chemical spill but the noodle version is excellent.  I just got it because it was a nice easy cheap lunch but it turned out to be really good. TL;DR Excellent product, tastes great..."
These crackers rock.  Wish company would let you buy assortment since you have to buy minimum of 6 boxes at a time. TL;DR Krunchy Kracker Heaven  :)
"I have used this to make chocolate chip cookies and angel food cake and they both turned out great. I used king arthur flours before being gluten free, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. TL;DR Great flour!"
"Great shipping -- 3 days earlier than expected! Careful packaging too!<br /><br />The product -- it tasted great and fresh. The aroma was fragrant, and when I drank the tea, I did feel invigorated with a loss of appetite. Works like a charm for those horrible 3am problem sets! TL;DR Delicious + Effective"
I thought the product was very good.I used some to make creamed salt cod and found the fish firm and tasty.Just like the cod I had as child. TL;DR Bacalao Salted Cod
"I've tried several of the Hansen's soda and this one is pretty good. Basically it tastes like vanilla cream soda. I didn't really get much of the cherry flavor. But it's pretty good, not as good as some of the other flavors though. TL;DR Pretty Good"
"I started feeding this to my 5 month old Yorkie; he has no problems transitioning to the food. We feed him two meals a day of this, with treat supplements and the occasional wet food (1/week or so).<br /><br />He doesn't seem to notice the difference between the 'Life Bits' and the regular food. (He doesn't avoid them or anything, as I've heard of other dogs doing this). TL;DR Healthy food for a growing puppy"
"Given that I liked this brand's granola so much, I anticipated finding this bars delicious as well.  Quite honestly I was underwhelmed by their flavor.  They don't taste bad -- and there is a nice, subtle cherry flavor -- but overall it just tasted like a slightly sweet flour-based bar.<br /><br />When I eat a bar like this, I'm generally looking for a decent protein content.  Unfortunately these bars (like this brand's granola) get almost all of their calories from fat and carbohydrates.  Each bar has only 4 grams of protein.  If I'm going to eat a low protein snack, I want it to be something more delicious than this.<br /><br />My biggest issue with this bar, however, is the addition of chicory root to bring up the fiber content.  Each bar contains 6 grams of fiber -- nearly 25% of the recommended daily fiber intake.  This could be a great thing for people who ordinarily don't eat whole foods, but if your diet regularly contains whole wheat, brown rice, and fruits and vegetables that contain fiber, then getting 25% of your daily fiber in a bar like this is only going to cause intestinal discomfort. TL;DR not particularly interesting...don't like the added chicory root"
"The Royal Canin Urinary formula is so tasty that two of the cats who eat it don't even have kidney issues.  They just like the taste!  The one who has had the crystals continues to remain crystal-free, so yay. TL;DR My vet sells this for over $50...so this price is great"
"This marvelous chocolate is addictive....but healthy.  Great taste, every so slightly salty.  Price is excellent and the chocolate ships well. TL;DR Best dark chocolate ever."
"This product arrived a little banged up, not in the best condition. We're able to use it and everything but the bottom of one of the giant tubs is concave so it doesn't sit stably, and the seals inside the lid are kind of, I don't know, greasy looking? That sounds worse than it actually is, but I wasn't super impressed. TL;DR Not Nesquik's Fault, But..."
I received the items purchased damaged and rancid.  I have been to Belize and actually visited and purchased this very product from an airport the first time I ever bought it.  I had been to Belize twice and was introduced to this product while staying in various areas.  I can't believe this person sent this great product to me and<br />expected me to believe it to be the same as I have had.  What a big disappointment!  I won't buy it through them again.  I threw both bottles away immediately. TL;DR Poor quality & Rancid taste
"I just love this product!!! I really like the fact that it comes in a 2 pack, I use one for cooking and have labeled the other ""NFC"", not for cooking. This is my new beauty product. I use it nightly as my moisturizer and have noticed that my skin is softer and my lines are less noticable. Even though it's oil, it doesn't make me break out (I tend to have oily skin) and I have rosacea, so I like the fact that it's natural. I've also used it as a deep conditioner on my hair with positive results. The smell is intoxicating, but not overwhelming, reminds me of Hawaii. It's great on any body part that is dry, feet especially. I even got my Mom on board, who has overly sensitive skin and she really likes it as well. Very happy that I found Nutiva. TL;DR Love it!!!"
i have a picky pooch that absolutely loves this stuff and will sniff it out! He is a very picky eater so the fact that he loves this food is pretty surprising! TL;DR Great!
"I thought I'd try these out after reading an article about Tony Packo's and I was not disappointed. These are awesome! The pickles and peppers have just the right amount of sweet and tart. Almost like eating dill and sweet pickles at the same time and then throwing in a little spice for good measure. I usually only eat pickles or relish on a hot dog but I put this on everything: hot dogs, sandwiches, hamburgers, side dish or just as a treat. They're almost addictive. I've been out for a few weeks and still think of them fondly. As a matter of fact, I'm going to finish writing this and go buy a couple of more before I forget! TL;DR Love these!!!"
I run 12 miles every weekend. I can tell the difference when I don't use this product. I take it and a PowerGel. TL;DR It Works
"These are the only brand of treats my cat will eat. She loves them! Prior to finding them on Amazon I would get them at local stores but it is so much cheaper to buy them through Amazon.<br />I always give my cat 4 or 5 treats every night before bed and sometimes during the day, so I can go through a bag of these pretty quick. For around $20 for 12-3oz packs is such a good deal, and the treats keep very well if you don't open them. TL;DR Wonderful!"
My dog always liked greenies.  Since she is now 13 years old this product is ideal for her.  They are softer than the the regular greenies TL;DR Greenies Senior
"I have 3 cats... they are rather ""non-finicky"" when it comes to dry food. They eat it like any other food, but lawd, this food gives all 3 ATROCIOUS gas. I'm hoping (& praying) their digestive system will adapt & it will pass...quickly.<br /><br />I have been using other ""natural"" cat food - can't recall brands bc I put it in a plastic bin & toss packaging. No other dry foods have produced this ""response"".<br /><br />The food has a strong smell & packaging was challenging to open. I recommend using scissors instead of trying to pull it apart - difficult & food went flying. TL;DR It's stinky"
"Johnnysfinefoods.com is the manufacturer and you can buy this size for $8/bottle.  This is sooooo worth it, best stuff ever, good on everything and THE BEST GARLIC BREAD! TL;DR BUY FROM THE STORE"
"Frankly, I was dissapointed.  I bought the same product in the glass bottle (smaller size) in my local grocery store and loved it.  Unfortunately (for reasons I do not know) this product had a slightly unpleasant chemically after-taste that the product in the glass bottle did not have. TL;DR Torani Sugar- Free Syrup in the Plastic Bottle"
"I brown hamburger with a little onion in a skillet, then cook this according to directions in the same skillet with the hamburger(I use really lean hamburger, so I don't even drain it).  Add a little sour cream and frozen peas at the end of the cooking time and you have a great tasting all in one skillet meal.  This will feed two if you add bread and a jello salad (or one if it's a teenage boy). TL;DR Knorr/Lipton Noodles & Sauce Stroganoff"
"My husband found this for me as I was always running out of nutmeg for my baking.  The little bottles you buy don't last long, and when he found these for a great price in fact I decided to try it.  It smells so good as you actually grind the nutmeg fresh to use.  The grinder is right on the end of the bottle so there is no mess or trying to find a grinder for it.  You get 3 bottles filled with all natural nutmeg to a pack so it will last some time.  Can't say enough about using it as it is so simple to just grind your own.  Great product. TL;DR Fresh nutmeg"
"This spicy, ranch flavored sauce is great on tacos or hamburgers, and I've even used it as salad dressing.  It tastes much better cold and the coolness offsets the spiciness. TL;DR Love it!"
"I just finished the last can in the package of twenty-four, so I think I've given it a fair try. I've also just finished reading the reviews, so I gave it two-stars instead of the one-star I came here to post, but that's as far as I can go.This product is completely unremarkable--""bland,"" someone else said. Precisely. Although I did manage to finish all twenty-four cans, there will never be a twenty-fifth. There are just too many other things I can drink--like water--to ever return to this. Sorry, but while it's not ""spitting out"" bad, as is another diet drink I know of, it's just not something worth any further consideration.  There's just no point in comparing it to Coke. Coke has character, this stuff is just a waste of time. TL;DR i won't buy this again"
"The coffee is delicious, the cost under the subscribe plan is the best value in the marketplace, alas -- the size of the pods forces me to only load 1 pod and hence have to get a mug of java via the one pod button, remove the used pod and load the 2nd pod, then push the 1 cup again.  My mug is full;however, I have to standby and wait for the the first cup to complete before loading the 2nd pod and filling my mug.  Minor inconvenience more than offset by the taste and value of Wolfgang's product and the convenience of receiving the coffee at my doorstep without shipping or tax.  Highly recommended:-) TL;DR If only 2 pods could fit in my Senseo coffee maker .. 5 stars"
"This stuff is amazing!  Luscious Chocolate coated flavored almonds.  I can even justify the treat because it is heart healthy (almonds).  Try them, I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. TL;DR Amazing!"
"When they say ""hint of pepper jack"", that's what I'm expecting, but these taste more like nacho cheese Doritos. They're pretty good, but totally not what I thought they would be. TL;DR Okay..."
"The pudding helps me care for my elderly mother.  She didn't like he shakes, and the puddings are not available in my area.  Great find for me. TL;DR Ensure - helps me care for my mother"
"I love a strong cup of coffee, which one surely is.  This is probably the strongest cup of coffee I have ever tasted.  Wonderful for those who have trouble getting started in the morning.  If this one doesn't wake you up, it may be time to make funeral arrangements!! TL;DR not for the faint of heart"
My son is on a gluten free diet and these bars are by far the best tasting we've found. TL;DR Crispy Bars
"There aren't any Nando's restaurants in my area (yet!) but I've long enjoyed their Hot Peri-Peri sauce.  It's one of the best of the many (well over 100) I've tried.  And while it's genuinely hot, it isn't overwhelmingly, inedibly so, as are some that vie for world's hottest honors.  But it's not just the right level of hotness that makes this so good.  It has a successful and unique recipe, which is rare, in my experience.  I more often prefer the simpler sauces that are little or nothing more than chili, vinegar and salt.  I've been to many other Portugese barbeque restaurants, and this would be ideal for the grilled chicken that is their specialty, so I'm definitely looking forward to my first visit to Nando's. TL;DR Great hot sauce"
I purchased the Ethical Coffee Capsules this week to try on my Nespresso Lattissima that I purchased from Sur La Table-which did not sell Nespresso capsules-Strange.<br />I picked the ECC Espressivo for its strong intensity rating as I like a strong espresso.  I popped the first capsule into the machine and pulled down the lever and heard the pop of the capsule and soon smelled a very pleasant aroma that immediately reminded me of the Italian coffee shops of Milan.  THe Espressivo had a very strong taste and a smooth finish and gave me just the right lift I was looking for.  I then had a latte the next day and the combination of milk & crema was perfect- I am sold.  The convenience of getting the capsules delivered right to our door (free of charge) is brilliant along with the whole biodegradable capsule which my wife said she would put into our garden is a nice feeling.  I have already ordered the other flavors.<br /><br />Coffee guy! TL;DR Real espresso taste
"First, Pill Pockets are a GREAT product that really works... before Pill Pockets, I only had a 50% success rate getting any of our dogs to take their pills when we used hotdogs and even steak leftovers. With Pill Pockets, the pill always goes ""down""!<br /><br />Pill Pockets are like Beef Playdoh, and are easy to tear into pieces. There is no need to use a whole pill pocket for a pill or capsule if the capsule or pill is small... just use enough pill pocket to cover the pill/capsule and fool your pet.  For instance, we tear each pill pocket in half and wrap that half around the dog's medication.  By the way, the size listed on the Pill Pocket bag indicates the size of the pill pocket, not the dog. Large meds require larger Pill Pockets; small meds like phenobarbital (for seizures) require only the small pill pockets or perhaps a piece of a large pill pocket.<br /><br />By the way, please DON'T waste your money buying Pill Pockets for cats if you have dogs. The reason I point this out is that I read a review (listed under another seller) that stated that it was more economical to buy the PillPockets for cats because you receive 45 instead of 35. Well, the reviewer failed to notice that the Pill Pockets for Cats only weighs 1.8 ounces, and the Pill Pockets (Small bag) for Dogs weighs 3.5 ounces! Buy the bag that, per ounce, is the least money. TL;DR Works like a charm even for smart and/or finicky dogs"
"I've been a coffee drinker for more than 30 years. I like mine black and usually prefer medium dark roasts. I bought a couple boxes of Timothy's Midnight Magic based on the reviews here and was not disappointed. It quickly became my favorite with Coffee People's Donut Shop a close second.<br /><br />When I want a strong cup of coffee using the largest setting on my Keurig B60, this is what I select. It's bold without being bitter and a surprisingly smooth-drinking coffee. While I usually can't stand the aftertaste of coffee, Midnight Magic has pleasant, almost clean aftertaste.<br /><br />What I like best about Midnight Magic is that I can use one K-Cup twice to fill my 16-ounce thermal travel mug (using the middle setting) and it provides the perfect coffee for my taste. TL;DR My favorite K-Cup"
"I bought these to use in my cranberry oatmeal macadamia nut cookies.  They worked great!  The only thing I'm not thrilled with is all the sugar!  In the cookies, I reduced the sugar to cope with the sugary cranberries.  They are great otherwise and love that they're organic. TL;DR dried cranberries"
"My mother is on a very limited budget and complained to me that coffee was too expensive.  I just stumbled on this while searching on Amazon for coffee to send to her.  She has been a Folgers fan for many years.  The price is great, much better than purchasing at the store.  Thanks Folgers and Amazon! TL;DR Best Buy Ever!"
"We are eating gluten free by choice.  We don't like cornbread as a rule, because cornbread made without some flour is just yucky.  I bought this mix at the grocery store on a fluke.  We needed it for a meal.  OMG!!!!  IT WAS AMAZING!!!!  I've made it using sweet milk and buttermilk.  No matter what milk we use it is amazing!  Even my picky granddaughter wants it all the time.  Well worth the money.<br /><br />It reaheats well too.  We have kept it in the refrigerator, wrapped for up to 10 days.  After day 9, it started drying out, but still tasted good.  We microwaved it with a wet papertowel covering the piece and it was good.<br /><br />I've made it by standard recipe, as well as jalepeno.  Yummy.  Chop some fresh jalepeno's, a small tomato, and a bit of onion.  Use 1/4 cup LESS of the milk and add a small (the teeny 'individual') can of creamed corn.  yummy! TL;DR BEST Cornbread I've ever eaten...PERIOD!"
"The popcorn was very cheesy and tasted fresh.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves cheese popcorn.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006THYCTS"">Golden Gourmet Cheese Flavored Popcorn 6oz Bags - Case of 12 Bags</a> TL;DR Delicious Popcorn"
"With all the organic, single-origin, Fair Trade, 80% + dark chocolates available even in discount stores, I am not quite sure why Newman's Own brand wanted to get in the chocolate business. Anyway, this is a very light-weight entry into the fray, and at only 54% pure chocolate (in the Vine sample I received, anyway), a quite weak entry at that. It tasted okay, but definitely too sweet and lacking the earthy bitter-sweet taste of the more cacao bean-heavy chocolates available. Not much different than a decent Hershey dark chocolate bar, and likely much more expensive. TL;DR A little too sweet..."
"The Mega Pop 6 0z packs covers more of the popcorn with the salt and butter flavoring, the Greater Northern packs leaves alot of popcorn unflavored and white<br /><br />Also the Mega Pop packs produces way more popcorn and less old maids and its not stale like greater northern TL;DR Mega Pop VS Greater Northern"
"Taste this water, and you won't be able to drink any other water, I've had FIJI, Evian, VOSS, etc and by far this is the best water I've ever tasted, I can't even explain how amazing this tastes, you should try it. TL;DR What's FIJI?"
"I find this one of the best coffee types for K cups.  I love the deep flavor.  The smell when it brews is intoxicating, especially first thing in the morning.  If you like a strong flavor coffee, this is wonderfully balanced, not bitter and keeps its flavor for the entire cup. TL;DR K cup review"
I really like the taste of this tea.  It is very relaxing and pleasant tasting.  I enjoy sitting in front of the tv with my tea while I watch a good Christmas movie. TL;DR Christmas Tea
"If  YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DRINK ENHANCER, THIS IS THE ONE. GREAT FLAVOR AND GREAT TASTE.I LOVE THE BLUEBERRY AND LEMON COMBINED.WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ENHANCER TO EVERYONE. TL;DR AWESOME PRODUCT"
"I found out after I purchased the product that it cost me almost 4 times what I could get it for at my local supermarket. Love the product, but I don't have money to throw away by paying a lot more than I needed to. TL;DR Great taste, bad price"
"We tried other brands of orange marmalade, but they were not as good as King Kelly Orange marmalade. We moved from the NW to the SW a few years ago and had trouble finding this brand in any of the local stores. Was delighted to find it on Amazon and Prime eligible!! Each of the six jars was individually wrapped in bubble wrap and then placed in a shipping box with 'air bags'. All arrived just fine...no breakage at all!! Now we are able to enjoy a brand we had been using before our move. TL;DR Amazon has it, local stores don't...."
"In my household are a vegetarian, a teenage boy, and a college student. I also have a family member with celiac disease. These bars worked for everyone. More important, everyone enjoyed them. It's always tough to describe food, but these are, of course, very peanut-y, and there is a slight hint of what is almost a jelly flavor. The bars are moderately chewy, and one bar does a very good job of quelling a hunger pang. As I said, everyone tried one, and five out of five people enjoyed these. TL;DR Everyone enjoyed these"
"Fully packed cans of a tasty salmon.  Not as good as fresh salmon, however makes great sandwiches and salads.  I add lemon juice...and last night ate it straight...put it in a dish and ate it ( I was in a hurry)..No bones...no odd questionable pieces.  I make sure I have an extra supply of this on hand at all times.  it was helpful during the power outage of 5 days last October. TL;DR not like fresh salmon but a super alternative.."
"I was looking for fiber and found not only 10 grams of fiber per serving but all that protein!  Way to go, Kashi!! TL;DR Delicious and good for me!!"
"My three year old son was put on this at birth. He did just fine and I never had any problems with him digesting, having gas, constipation, ect...<br /><br />My daughter, that's another story.  She got so constipated on this stuff she would go two days without going potty.  And she started screaming terribly when she did go.  She ended up being switched over to the GS soy, and then the natural cultures.<br /><br />All in all, it all depends on the baby. Try it on a small can, and then if it works well, go to WIC and have them pay for formula. You can get any type of Goodstart on wic. You just have to have a reason to get something other than the purple or orange can. That is the cheapest way to get it. And wic doesn't go by income. rich and poor both are welcome to wic. TL;DR Good and bad experiences."
The Durkee Spices really are great. The crushed red pepper has an almost roasted aroma and taste. The heat is just about perfect. Used some as soon as I received it. I made hot mustard with it instead of grinding up peppers. Worked great !!<br /><br />Also with Durkee you know when the spices have been packed by the date code. Many others do not bother to put one on their packages. TL;DR Pepperiffic !!
My dog loves these raw hides [ok so she loves any raw hide] but I love that they are rolled nice and tight and are not filled with little pieces.  The ones I buy in the stores tend to have lots of loose pieces in the roll and I'm afraid my dog will choke on them.  These are great and the price is decent too. TL;DR Will Buy These Again
"After years of eating cereal, I got bored of the dull flavors and stopped eating cereal. I didn't look foward to eating cereal in the mornings anymore. Then one day I walk by the cereal aisle and I see this and decide to buy it. Best decision ever, the cereal taste good dry and with milk. Trust me on this one and buy it! TL;DR BEST cereal ever"
"Fresh, easy cup of delicious coffee in one minute. Fill the water tank, push the button to heat the water, push the button to push the water through the pod and you get one or two cups of coffee with foam on top. TL;DR Senseo Dark Roast Coffee Pods"
Best treat when you desire chocolate. A few of these healthy treats will do the trick. They are the best!! TL;DR Craving chocolate?
"This Chef Michael's grilled sirloin flavor went over well with the dogs, while both are older the lapdog has a hard time with some dry foods, he was able to chew through this. I like to change dog foods often to avoid a build up of any one ingredient or vitamin, some dog foods give the dogs loose stool, but we had no problems with this. First ingredient is beef, soy, animal fat, brewers rice, corn coming far down the list which is something I prefer, we will buy this dog food again. TL;DR Dogs loved it"
"Dense, flavorless, chalky, barely edible. Nothing about it reminds me of s Turtle. TL;DR Yucchhhh!!!!!"
I am so happy to be able to get this product on line since I have not been able to find this flavor in any of my local stores for the 3 years I have lived here...south shore of Boston. TL;DR refreshing
"It's been a nightmare finding yeast at my local grocery stores - they only seem to be stocking these tiny little 0.25 ounce packets for +$3 for a three pack.  I was so pleased to find that amazon is stocking Bob's yeast - not only is the price unbelievably good, but the quality is impressive as well.  If you plan on doing any baking in the future, I would highly recommend always having some of this in stock - it stores very well in the fridge for long periods of time, and the results can't be beat, especially for the price! TL;DR Just what the baker ordered!"
"I've used this on several occasions on both carpet and furniture, to remove pet vomit (cat) and feces/urine(dog).  It worked 100% on both teh smell and stain, especially with a repeat application for the worst offender.  Smell is clean and very strong but fades after a day or two into a pleasant fresh smell. TL;DR it really does work"
"If anything I have notice a slight benefit in memory (short term, but I still forget peoples names when we meet. LOL<br />Taste is OK can't quite explain it. I mix 1 oz in a glass of water and drink it first thing in the morning. TL;DR Still evaluating results"
"This kettle chips taste ""Good , Crispy & Crunchy "" too ! U will enjoy it also! Moreover,it's thinly cut & sliced! TL;DR kettle chips"
I am on a gluten free diet and enjoy the ginger snaps as a snack.  My cookie jar is often empty as my husband loves to eat them too. We have bought them at major grocery and health food stores. It is wonderful to have fresh ones delivered.  The next order is for 2 boxes a month but then one box a month until winter.  I must try them in cooking:  sauerbraten or pie filling.  They are very tasty and great with tea or coffee.  I receive the MI-Del Ginger Snaps from Amazon. TL;DR Delicious Gluten Free Ginger Snaps From Amazon
We thought this was a pretty good deal. Well at least they taste OK. The expiration date was for Sep xx 2011. Would have been nice to know since we ordered a case and won't be using it all in two weeks. The product in the can is also all mashed up so if you want to use anchovies in the fillet(whole) this is not a possibilty. The expiration date should be listed on line. TL;DR Not a great deal
Due to extreme heat overseas I found this a perfect gift to send to our troops. Most of them love chocolate but impossible to send during summer. TL;DR great treat for soldiers
Our family really enjoys all of the flavors that come in this pack.  There isn't a single one that we don't like.  Tigers blood has become a family favorite despite the name that made me hesitant to try it.  We will be ordering more! TL;DR Just what we were looking for
"While it doesn't quite have the strength of British Typhoo tea, PG Tips makes superb iced-tea.<br /><br />Ted TL;DR Superb tea"
I have this for breakfast everyday with raspberries on top. It is delicious. I always look forward to eating it. TL;DR Great Cereal
"I've tried 4 different brands of quinoa and they all pretty much taste and cook up the same. The best thing about this one though is that at the time of this review it is the cheapest that Amazon sells, when measured by price per ounce and without having to buy a 10lb bag.<br /><br />If you like quinoa then you can't go wrong with this product. TL;DR Taste like Quinoa"
"What a wonderful taste these little pods have.  It's a pleasure to bring a little southern flava' up to New England!  Almost made me wish I hadn't gotten rid of my keurig! After it broke a second time and seeing how devastating these are to the environment, I'm all set!  But to each their own, if use keurig, these pods are delicious. TL;DR Wicked good, ya'll"
"These are the only cookies I have found that I can safely eat without feeling poorly afterwards and which taste similar to a ""real"" chocolate chip cookie. I try to limit refined sugars, wheat flour, and dairy products in my diet for health reasons, but oh, how I miss cookies. The ones I bake myself just don't taste that great, but these chocolate chip cookies from Nana's help me keep to my prescribed way of eating. I don't know what I'd do without them! I like to freeze them, and sometimes I top one with a bit of Rice Dream ""ice cream"" on top. Yummy! TL;DR Yummy and healthy!"
"I have three cats and every day before I leave for work in the morning I yell ""treats"" and my three butterballs come running.  Not all treats are created equal, but my fussy eater cat likes these treats.<br /><br />This is a really good price for these treats; the three cats consume 1 ounce per week so the seven pack of 6.5 ounce will last me 6-8 months.  Expiration date is some time in 2012 but they will be comsumed by then.<br /><br />While I feed my cats high quality cat food, they hate the healthy treats and I have given up and just buy these treats.<br /><br />For treats, these are as good as any other I've tried and all of my cats seem to like them. TL;DR Good price for these treats"
"For some reason, all the flavored coffees are a light roast which, unfortunately, leaves them with little flavor.  If you are not a coffee lover, this is for you. TL;DR coffee"
"Both me and my husband love the manna as a spread on a homemade bread, it is delicious. It smells very much of coconut, and at first you expect it to be sweet, but it is not, well, almost. There is some sweetness to it. It does not leave that greasy feeling in your mouth as if you ate some lard, although it surely does look like it.<br />It was not too easy to spread on soft bread at room temperature (we keep rooms about 72F) and keeping it in hot water didn't work, since the outside melted, but the core was still hard. I simply cut thin slices of it and put on my bread.<br />Kids were brave enough to try it, but didn't really like manna. Probably because it smells so deceiving of being sweet. Only our two-year old asked for the second bite.<br />I didn't try to cook with it yet.<br />I think it is great nutritious alternative to regular butter, though an acquired taste. TL;DR wonderful on bread"
I think it tastes too dark.  I prefer Donut Shop Coffee from Coffee People.  Medium color and bold.  This stuff tastes burnt to me. TL;DR Too dark for my taste
I am vegetarian and use one table spoon in my beans. It give them the slow cooked for days taste. It also adds just the right amount of flavour. i love it! TL;DR makes my tacs awesome
"Oh my these were so GOOD. Delicate,slightly fried flavor and texture with nori and wasabi on the reverse. Hot,spicy and just too good. Worth the cost and shipping. TL;DR Japanese crackers"
Hands down one of the finest Hot Sauces you can purchase. I've purchased (and thrown away) many different Hot Sauces of different types and brands and haven't found any (yet) that come close to Marie Sharp's Fiery Hot Habanero Sauce. It has an excellent flavor with just a hint of garlic and a good bite. I couldn't recommend this one enough. TL;DR Very fine Hot Sauce
"My 12 year old son who is gluten, dairy, soy, and egg free loves this bar. He is a little particular about his bars and there are limited choices that meet his dietary requirements. He loves this one and some of the other flavors of Kind Bars (check labels- not all are soy free). TL;DR Really good."
The rose powder is very potent and good for making rose water.<br /><br />Well packaged. TL;DR Smells like roses
This little cube gives your food a wonderful flavor and is not hot this will make your dishes have a wonderful flavor or for when your BQ this gives the meat a good flavor also.... TL;DR Amazing Cube
"Nice glass jar and I love the pattern all over it. The lid is plastic- but screws on for a good seal. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think the lid's fit could be better. But around our house, trates don't stay long enough to get stale ;0)<br />I wouldn't go any taller than this size (three sizes are availabe- this is thee middle one) though. I am thinking of getting the smaller size as well. TL;DR nice jar"
"Carrot cake is absolutely the best cake out there. Now, I can bake a delicious cake whenever I feel like it. So handy. TL;DR Carrot Cake"
"I happen to love blueberries so, I instantly thought I would love this item: hated it.  The product actually leaves a bad after-taste in your mouth.  It has very little blueberry filling in it as it is primarily a terrible cake wrapping that surrounds a scarce blueberry filling.  I can't recommend these to anyone unless their getting them free and even then I wouldn't eat too many of them as they seem to be horribly fattening.  Unfortunately I bought two packs of these things; wish I still had my dog.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5S6M"">Glutino Gluten Free Breakfast Bars, Blueberry, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> TL;DR Disappointment"
"We are not tea connoisseurs, so we don't know how Pu-ehr tea is suppossed to taste.  We use this tea to make iced tea, just like we do with regular Lipton tea.  As for the health benifits, we haven't really noticed any yet, but it makes great iced tea.<br /><br />Update:<br />After we finished this box of tea, we ordered another brand <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0086FQYAQ"">Pu Erh Tea (Premium) 100 Bags, by Tea King of China from the Famous Nannuoshan (Mountain) in Yunnan</a>.  It cost a few dollars more, and I thought maybe it's even better than this brand, but I was disappointed with the King of China brand.  The Prince of Peace tea has a darker, richer taste.  I will keep buying this (Prince of Peace) brand from now on. TL;DR Tastes like regular black tea to us."
"This tea is delicious. I had liked the ""Kombucha"" yogi makes, and this is very similar, but better.  It still has kombucha, but the mint flavor is just a tad stronger, which makes it taste more refreshing.  The tea wakes up my brain and helps me study, and is the perfect cure for the morning after a long night out.  The little bit of caffeine also helps me stay awake at work -- I drink about 3 throughout each day. Highly recommended! TL;DR greater version of togi's kombucha tea"
"I do like a good Chipotle(Who Doesn't?)and these are the best. Wonderfull in a pot of anything, Chili, Lima Beans even scrambled eggs! I recommend them highly! TL;DR Great Chipotle"
"My 6 year old is a very picky eater, and it's been difficult to get him to eat fruits and veggies. He loves these. He pretends it's one long tongue he sticks out at me which he then eats. I pretend to be incensed. TL;DR Great natural snack"
I am happy with this product and how natural it is. I did't like that all of the other rice cereals had things in them that i could not say. TL;DR Happy customer
"I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.  Do your research as there are some foods that should not be fed to your dogs includeing cooked bones which can cause havoc for them. TL;DR Great Product - Too Expensive!"
I still have yet to find any type of sour candy/gum that I enjoy more than this.  This gum is hard to find in the stores so I hope it stays available online.  I do miss the days when it used to be filled with sour powder in the middle though.  Still the best that you will find. TL;DR Worth every cent if you enjoy sour candy
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00186ZLIQ"">Davinci Pasta, Long Cuts, Linguine, 16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 20)</a> Very good, better then expected. TL;DR Pasta"
"My cat does soft treats only, so these are great for him.  It's nice that I can buy them in bulk and get them delivered to the door two day shipping for free with my prime membership.  I'm not sure he really cares which flavor, but I like the idea of ""Caribbean Catch Tuna""... it makes me feel like he gets a little vacation in every bite. TL;DR Vacation Treats"
"Great service , flowers were fresh on arrival. My wife simply loved them. One of the best birthday gifts she has received TL;DR Great Birthday Gift"
Used this tea during pregnancy and to save a few bucks. It works just as good as the brand name one. TL;DR As great as the brand name one.
"I drink green tea almost every day and I always stick with the traditional ones. I don't like other flavors in my tea. Personally, this one tastes horrible. I just can't stand the combination of lemon balm and verbena and green tea. Well, if you want to try something new, you may want to consider this product. If you're a traditional green tea consumer like me, you should avoid it. TL;DR Horrible taste"
"Great, fast service. Perfect for travelling and I don't have to worry about any plastic chemicals. My only complaint is that they don't come in other sizes, since baby is eating 4-5oz now. But I'm just sure to have two on hand. It is no sweat to switch a nipple. I will be purchasing this again. TL;DR Pleased"
I am very pleased with the Keebler Oyster Crackers. I shared them with family. They are good as a snack and good in chili or soup.<br />The price was right and I will purchase again.<br />Dianne Long TL;DR Keebler is the best
"I was pleased at the price for this product.  In the store it sell for a lot more.  Also, the fact that it was shipped at no cost to me, was a plus.  I was amazed at how fast I got my order. TL;DR NB Premium Dog Dog"
"This product loses one star because it tastes a bit like instant coffee, but you get used to that flavor fast as the months roll by without need of maintenance. Gone are the days of pulling out a filter, a filter tray, a coffee pot, and for some a grinder for daily washing. You merely take out the tiny pod tray and rinse it off when you're done drinking coffee for the day. If you use filtered water, there won't be any calcium deposits. The only thing you have to watch for is green algae growing in the water reservoir, but that takes a really long time to develop. This coffee and it's hardware are effortless to make and maintain. A little pricy, but such a time saver!!! I would definitely recommend SENSEO. TL;DR Hassle Free Coffee!!!!"
I have been sampling a few dark chocolate bars lately to see which one I like the best and this one hands down is my favorite. TL;DR Best Dark Chocolate Bar
"The cans were so badly dented, when I opened the box, that the lids were off and no longer will fit back on. I am not sure how the peanuts are, but the Amazon packaging is a joke (as it is for most of their items these days). Also, the nuts expire in 3 months! A fresh batch would normally expire in a year. This is the third foodstuff that I have purchased on Amazon that was going to expire in the same month that I bought it or within three months. The last two were on sale (though the soon-to-be-met expiration date should've been noted by Amazon). These nuts aren't even on sale!  Now I am wondering about other foodstuffs that I have purchased here at Amazon. Looking at expiration dates from a reputable source isn't something I thought I should have to do. hmmm TL;DR Dents like road kill"
"I have tried this and Hills Bros and like this product much better!  However, it is hard to find in the stores now for some reason, so I am happy to be able to order it online and I like the automatic re-order feature.  Also a very good price from what I used to pay in the stores. TL;DR Delicious Cappuccino"
"This is my favorite cereal. Its healthy and it tastes great!<br /><br />However the price that amazon offers is not a good deal. In your local supermarket, a 16 ounce box cost 3.69 at retail price. Hence, for a pack of 6 it should cost 22.14.<br /><br />Amazon charges over 25 dollars for this and even with the subscription, it is a very small discount. TL;DR Best cereal but bad price"
"I ended up throwing it all way -- all 25 lbs of my order after I used a few pounds of it to make my grandmother's recipe for posole. It just wasn't TRUE posole. Although it resembled the creamy white kernels in appearance (except the kernels were a bit rounded and too fat at the germ), the taste was completely wrong.  It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't posole and I couldn't eat it. I believe this corn is used for Ecuadorean food -- definitely not Mexican -- and certainly not posole. What a disappointment that this company (who does have lovely offerings on their web site) is passing this product off, perhaps unintentionally, as something it certainly isn't. Yeah, I should have tried to return it, but I was so disgusted. It took me a while to get my perspective back -- I mean, it was only corn... I'm better now...  :] TL;DR Definitely not true posole corn and not what I expected..."
"I really love the versatility of this product.  You can use it in baked goods where it adds a wonderful, moist texture.  You can use it in hot drinks like tea (I use it in green, white, red and herbal teas).  You can add it to cold beverages and you don't get clumps like with powdered sweetners.  It doesn't leave an after taste and you don't have to worry about getting a sugar rush or an artificial sweetner headache.<br /><br />My most unusual use?  That's easy - I love to use it on pancakes and waffles in place of maple syrup! It's especially wonderful when you combine it with real blueberries heated just until they're starting to melt, piled high on a flax or multigrain waffle. TL;DR Best Natural Sweetner I've Found"
"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon is a powdered drink mix that can be served using either hot or cold water. The fine powder dissolves quickly and the beverage is mixed and ready to drink in less than one minute.<br /><br />I like the taste of lemons and ginger, but I wasn't prepared for the taste of this beverage. I admit that it does have a nice, enticing aroma and the combination of these two ingredients sounds appealing, both for the potential flavor and for the settling effects on the stomach. However, the taste of this beverage is not what I expected. It doesn't taste as natural as I thought it would and it has a certain harshness that is most evident in the back of the throat. I followed the directions and added a cup of hot water, but considering the harsh flavor, perhaps I should have used more water.<br /><br />Among the flavors present, the ginger is the one most noticeable and it's the spicy finish that creates that harshness. I was able to finish mine off by taking only small sips at a time, but I can understand why some would have a difficult time drinking this instant beverage. My enjoyment of spicy foods and drinks made it a little more tolerable for me, but I would bet that others would have a difficult time consuming this drink.<br /><br />Ginger and lemons might be a nice combination, but they don't mesh very well in this instance. I won't be buying this drink again, as I found it less smooth and less enjoyable than its taste combination promises. TL;DR Harsh and Less than Enjoyable"
"Would give 3 stars for how really small these are, but the shipping was so fast, I upped it a star.  The decrease of Subscribe & Save discount from 15% to only 5% really hurts the ability to get any good value on multi packs of dog raw hides.<br /><br />These are so small (compared to the many different orders and brands I've purchased from Amazon, it is the same cost as my corner pet store.  Did love the Amazon Subscribe & Save with a great sale price given my small fixed income.<br /><br />Will probably be cutting back on almost all now.  Drats!  But still love Amazon in general. TL;DR The Biggest of the 8 Rawhides is BARELY 4"" - REALLY SMALL FOR PRICE"
"Graham crackers have always been packaged in larger stacks, which meant that you never used up the whole stack and had to tightly repackage the remaining crackers to prevent spoilage. This new, much more compact packaging avoids waste and has an even better quality: it makes them more portable--a very good thing for graham crackers, which are so soothing to the stomach and digestion.<br /><br />I remember that, when I was pregnant, I always had graham crackers in a drawer at work to settle my stomach. I always take them on trips, since I tend to get every type of travel sickness imaginable (air, sea, car--you name it!)and its something to have in the hotel room between meals or at night that is neither too sweet nor salty. I also use them to accompany medications that have to be taken with food--and this new smaller packaging is just what the doctor ordered. TL;DR Why didn't someone think of this before!"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YAQ3XW"">4 Oz - Apple Wood Smoked Sea Salt Yakima Applewood Great on the BBQ</a> This is third smoked sea salt that I have tried ... Hickory, Alder Wood and now Apple Wood smoked sea salt. I can tell the subtle difference in taste with each. I have been using them on my steaks, chops, poultry and fish. A real taste treat in rubs also. TL;DR ""Yummo"" ... Smoked Sea Salt"
Turns out to be a little to strong.  Got too wired after a cup.  Replaced it with Coffee People Kona blend which is more to my liking. TL;DR Morning wake up
"An absolute favorite in my house. My son would drink ten of these a day if we let him! He even prefers them to the chocolate variety, to which my daughter is partial. This price on Amazon is crazy. I got a pack of these this morning for $13 at my local Acme! TL;DR my son LOVES this stuff"
Perfect under cabinet storage for all of your beverage brewing cups. Excellent quality for those who have limited (or no) counter space! TL;DR Very Handy
"I have tried several brands of organic Manuka honey and Wedderspoon is absolutely the best tasting, best texture and I feel the most beneficial in terms of settling my stomach and acid reflux. Yes, it is expensive, but the price on Amazon is a lot cheaper than retail stores I've seen. TL;DR Best Manuka Honey on the Market"
"I went hunting for academic jobs in Australia in 1985.  This was right after American media saturation with Men at Work's ""Land Down Under"".  So, after going through customs in Sydney I was a bit hungry.  I saw a little food stand and one of the things on the menu list was Vegemite Sandwich.  So, I thought, ""Why Not?"".  I was kind of surprised by the first bite.  I like salty foods, and by the time I finished the sandwich I was hooked.  I brought 4 large size jars back with me.  When I finished the third jar back at home, I tried to find a supply.  A guy who knew a guy hooked me up with some boutique in New York that was owned by Olivia Newton John and that sold Vegemite.  I was saved!  Several years later, I moved to Dayton, OH and across from the main gate of Wright-Patterson AFB in downtown Fairborn, there was a little British specialty shop that actually stocked Vegemite.  That kept me supplied through most of the early 90s.  By the time that the internet had caught on you could go on line and find people (mostly in Australia) who would ship it to you.  Now, having the convenience of ordering it from Amazon a jar is only 2 days away.  Thanks, Amazon!<br /><br />If you don't like salty you probably won't like Vegemite sandwiches, however, making a sandwich is only one use for Vegemite.  I've been cooking with the stuff since about 1990.  One of my favorites is scrambled eggs, with tomato cubes and a tsp of Vegemite.  Used this way, the Vegemite becomes much less concentrated than it does on toast and doesn't add much more salt than you probably would normally put on eggs.  However, what it does add is an incredible flavor boost.  Another of my favorites is Vegemite spaghetti.  Melt 1/4 stick of butter (or whatever you're substituting) in a pan and add a tsp of Vegemite and about 1/8 cup of the spaghetti boiling water.  Throw the freshly boiled spaghetti into the pan and saute on low heat for about 2 min.  Just before turning off the heat, throw in about 1/4 cup Kraft Parmesan/Romano Cheese.  Mix well and then serve.  Those quantities treat about enough spaghetti for two.<br /><br />Actually, Vegemite is no more salty than, say, a bullion cube.  So, after you understand what Vegemite tastes like (other than salty), you will immediately see why you can substitute a tsp of Vegemite anywhere you might use a bullion cube.<br /><br />Try it, you will probably like it! TL;DR American Vegemite junkie for 27 years!!!"
"I just bought these to use as a pie-crust (the gluten free version). Holy cow, they're delicious! I could hardly resist eating them before I got the crust finished. I was skeptical, but I don't think I'll ever buy regular grahams again (and I don't even have a gluten allergy). TL;DR delish!"
My little grandaughter wants to eat this with every meal. She considers it a real treat.  Makes it that much better that its good for her. She has been able to feed it to herself since she was 8 months old.  Love the pouches. TL;DR Granddaughters favorite food!
"This is the same as the masala dosa from a Udipi restaurant. I am beyond thrilled to find it on Amazon. As the other reviewer pointed out, its a lot of work to make the crepe batter and the filling, so this is well worth the price.<br />Also love the free upgrade to overnight shipping. TL;DR Taste of home!"
"Makes a nice cup of coffee. Nothing outstanding, just a nice cup of coffee.<br />However, we're having a lot of the K-cups mess up with this product. The foil comes loose from the cup and causes the grounds to squirt out the opening. This leaves you with a coffee maker to clean up and grounds in your coffee.<br />Thinner foil covering or better sealing is needed before we would buy this product again. TL;DR Good coffee but faulty packaging."
"I have been a fan of Crystal Light products for years. Their mocktail line  of instant drinks provides another tasty treat to delight your tastebuds. Everyone I shared it with thought it was delicious and made an impressive mocktail. Appletini was the perfect blend of sour and sweet with no bad aftertaste.<br />This vibrant green, pleasantly apple-flavored drink dissolves quickly and easily in water and can be ready to party in under five minutes. Once your friends try it you'll be lucky if a pitcher of it lasts that long. TL;DR Mocktail Hour? It's Appletini Time!"
"I have been staring at this on the shelf for a while but hesitant to purchase it. We have a record in this house of buying cereal that is a 'must have' only for it to sit on a shelf when the kids didn't care for it. (I'm looking at you Marshmallow Fruity Pebbles).<br /><br />When we were offered the chance to sample the Krave double chocolate cereal, I jumped at it. Everyone in my house liked it! My 5 and 8 year olds just loved every bite and requested it for breakfast until it was gone. Even my husband who isn't a fan of cereal liked it.<br /><br />The inside is smooth and chocolatey and the outside in crunchy. Not as crunchy as mini-wheats, but close. The size of each bite was about a mini-wheat little bites size. They did that magic that turned milk into chocolate milk when done with the cereal in the bowl. Kids thought that was super.<br /><br />I am looking forward to now trying the other flavors, especially the regular with chocolate filling. TL;DR Extra Yummy!"
"Can't live without it, Dentist rec, not available were I live so Must buy online in bulk, rather pricey 4 gum, but worth it! TL;DR Love this gum"
I love this product it makes great lemon pepper wings. My mother actually recommended it to me. TL;DR This product is great
"Excellent Protein bar for those with gluten intolerance,,,Great taste, Great price!<br />This is a much better deal than purchasing the bars in a Trader Joe's or local health food store.<br />The only thing missing is the range of flavors. There are several available flavors missing from the pack. TL;DR Excellent Protein bar for those with gluten intolerance,"
"These are commonly called ""squashed-fly"" biscuits in the UK.  I have eaten the domestic and English varities, and I feel there is little to choose between them.  I am just happy enough to have Amazon provide them, in order for me to properly enjoy my Yorkshire tea. TL;DR Squashed Fly Biscuits"
"I just purchased the 5lb Spike seasoning, been looking to purchase in bulk and getting a great value. I use this seasoning on everything including all meats and fish! TL;DR 5lb Spike"
"We just started making our own yogurt, and we find that using this starter results in a much better product than using commercial yogurt. It's easy to use, and makes great yogurt. Can't ask for much more than that! TL;DR Excellent yogurt starter"
"This is a great product for those seeking an alternative to prepare a quality dish.  The product is very easy to prepare and gives you the basics.  You can enjoy as it is prepared, or simply add vegetables, meat or fish and you really have built a very good meal.  The packaging is attractive and the directions are very straightforward. TL;DR Barilla Whole Grain Penne"
These are my new favorite product from Omaha Steaks. They are delicious and VERY easy to prepare. You can go from freezer to microwave to your dinner table in 3 minutes as they are precooked! I serve them over rice with salsa or make nachos or tacos with them. WARNING! If you purchase these you'll become addicted. GOOD STUFF! TL;DR Delicious and easy to prepare!
"I add grated cheese and some sliced green onions and make the cornbread as directed. It is a terrific ""bread"" for those of us who need gluten free food. TL;DR Superb Cornbread!"
"Last night my family tried the Patak Tikka Masala sauce.  Boy, that was good! Tonight, we tried the Patak Tandoori Paste-- and, yes, that was good, too!<br /><br />The paste is very easy to use.  I used boneless skinless chicken breast.  I mixed 8 -10 tbsp of this paste with 6-7 tbsps of plain yogurt and marinated for several hours.  Then, I baked the chicken for about 1/2 hour and it's done!  It's rare when I serve a meal that everyone in my family likes, but I've now served 2 meals in a row that everyone in my family raved about!<br /><br />I served this with couscous and a salad.  Very quick, easy, and very very good! TL;DR Another excellent entree!"
"These are probably the strongest mints I've tasted other than Smints.  They are about the size and shape of a sweet tart.  Like the previous reviews stated, they  are kind of crumbly and dissolve quickly in your mouth.  Good for a quick blast of mint to coat your mouth.  If you're looking for a mint to suck on, you're better off with Spry. TL;DR Ricochet"
"Great flour, I just received a bread maker as a gift and wanted something besides white bread flour, this is it!  Well worth the money and still cheaper than buying processed bread! TL;DR Excellent bread flour!"
Drawer is much larger than it appears in photo and takes up much more space on the cabinet surface. The drawer is sticky and not easily opened or closed. I would not purchase again. TL;DR Keurig Storage Drawer
"Whenever I open the cabinet w/ the catnip in it, my cat runs toward me like a bullet eager for her herbs.  I usually just buy it from the market - no fancy brand.  However, when I put Cosmic Catnip in her bowl, she came running as she usually does, but turned her nose at it and this was three days ago.  It is still sitting in her bowl untouched.  The store brand of catnip is gone in SECONDS. Clearly, Cosmic Catnip is not a favorite w/ my Peesh. TL;DR Kitty Wouldn't Touch It"
"Strong, versatile, and funky to boot.  I use them for everything, even as handbags.  About to order more since I'm finding so many great uses. TL;DR Get these!"
"Expensive, nasty and low in protein! I really don't understand how this product has got good reviews. I am not exagerating but the taste is nasty. I drunk it once and the rest I flushed through the toilet. Bad! TL;DR Nasty taste!"
"This is simply the best-tasting gluten-free mix available.  Has an excellent flavor and texture, not gritty at all like so many others.  Nobody can tell it's wheat-free, and I've made pancakes for a lot of people!  I do add an extra egg and some sour cream and this mix makes heavenly pancakes. TL;DR Best glutan-free"
This is the first brand I have ever tried of soba noodles. They are very easy to prepare. I boiled them in water for about 2-3 minutes then put them in a strainer. Then I run cold water over the noodles. I could eat them like that with a little salt and dipping sauce or add them to a stir fry with veggies and meat. Great food. My husband is addicted to them too. TL;DR Delicious!
ordered a case of this to only receive it with an experation date for 3 weeks away. very very disappointed TL;DR rip off
"This item is just OK.  It does make a 16 ounce glass of iced coffee, however it could be stronger both in the vanilla and the coffee. TL;DR Just OK"
"These treats occupy my dogs (quietly!) while they clean their teeth at the same time. The first time I tried them, I bought the large ones to cut in half so I'd get more for my money, but believe me, it was definitely NOT worth the hassle. They are very hard and hard to cut. The ""Regular"" size is perfect for my 50-65 lb. dogs. TL;DR Yummy and Good-for-you, Too!"
"I've been a full service restaurant cook for the past 10 years. Ever since I discovered this rub, I have not used anything else for my steaks at home. I coat both sides with a very thin layer of vegetable oil (which helps the flavor of the rub soak into the meat), then coat both sides with a very generous and EVEN layer of rub. Once you've done that, take the meat and thoroughly rub it in. Fire up the ol' charcoal grill, throw 'em on, and a couple minutes later, you have the finest top sirloin steaks that money can buy. The steak has so much flavor that it would be insulted if you ate it with steak sauce. I'm not kidding. TL;DR I don't use anything else"
Absolutely loved the quick service and attention I received from this company - the products were received a lot faster than anticipated - I will definitely use them again and again! TL;DR matzo farfel
"A friend brought some of these to work and they are wonderful!  I have not been able to find them locally, so I have been ordering.  Well worth trying! TL;DR Fabulous!"
"I was impressed with how much information is available about the benefits from using herbal tea.<br /><br />The Higgins & Burke peppermint flavored herbal tea, appeals to my sense of smell as the tea is heating so I was mentally uplifted and relaxed before sampling the tea itself.<br /><br />According tot he package this peppermint herbal tea is ""Bursting with cool menthol, ...and provides a flavorful experience anytime of day.<br /><br />I enjoy having a cup of hot tea in the mid afternoon, which serves as a nice pick-me-up. My favorite thing to do is to dunk coconut cookies into the tea and add to the flavor of the cookie and the tea itself.<br /><br />The benefits spoken of most frequently are:<br />-it helps to support a healthy heart<br />-enables the person to feel a sense of calmness<br />-provides a cleansing property for the body<br />-promotes energy and wellness.<br /><br />I like my tea hot but during the hot summer days, making iced tea as a means to help cool off, is something I look forward to. TL;DR Ah, the pause that really refreshes"
"I ordered these primarily to wrap wine bottles, which may be an unusual case. (When stacking wine in the basement, I like to wrap the bottles to help protect the labels, block light, and cushion in case of an earthquake.) The size is exactly what I expected for a ""lunch"" size bag.<br /><br />The bags are a nice bright white. However, they are fairly thin - not like brown paper bags in thickness, and substantially thinner and lighter than copier paper. They are partially translucent. This would be a good thing if you wanted to use them for luminaria or something like that.<br /><br />For lunches, they should be OK as long as there is nothing really dense (like a soda can). For my wine bottles they are also OK except of little use for blind tasting; you can read most wine labels through the bag.<br /><br />Overall I'm satisfied but would like something thicker. So I'm giving 3 stars for a decent product but nothing exciting. TL;DR OK. Clean looking but thin paper."
"I have used the regular Degree anti-perspirant without any problems. I bought the new Degree Silver Ion and after the first I experienced the same as the previous reviewers. It left ft my arm pits itching severally for several days, very irritating. It caused a lot of redness also...<br />Do not take a chance on this one TL;DR Itchy and irritating - strong allergic reaction"
"Kitchens of India Curry paste has become a staple item in our pantry at home.<br />It allows for fast meals during the weekdays, and slightly elaborate meals for the weekend. TL;DR The Best."
"I was expecting this cereal to have the texture of Cheerios, but it is more like Capt'n Crunch. The peanut bits are barely visible stuck on the little o's, and really don't add any peanutty flavor. Since its name is ""Crunchy Nut"" I expected at least some peanut flavor, which I did not get, so I deducted one star for that.<br /><br />Having said that, though, I like this cereal, both dry and with milk. It's crunchy and sweet. What it isn't, tho, is health food, and I don't expect it to be. What it is, is a crunchy sugar rush, perfect for when I have such a craving. TL;DR Tasty Cereal"
I've drank every coconut water on the market and this one is the less impressive. The coconut juice was severely watered down and it tasted like 5 part water to 1 part of coconut juice. TL;DR WATERED DOWN...
"These are not anywhere as good as Ron Teeguarden's / Bija's sun dried gojis.  I'm not sure what the difference is but I bet it's because the Bija ones are grown elsewhere, maybe a different part of China or possibly Tibet.  In any case, I'll be sourcing my goji's from vitacost anyway... even though I'm non religious I still get a peace of mind buying from Buddhist Tibetans versus Chinese Muslims considering all the turmoil that is not caused in any way by Buddhists in the world. TL;DR Too dry, made in China"
I love all of their seasonings. I have tried all of them and have never been disappointed at all.  No MSG and perfect mixtures. TL;DR Yum
"I would order these again in a heartbeat!  Amazingly good - can't even tell they're vegan!  To be honest, I ordered these as a gift for someone but they looked so good that I ate them and had to re-order!  Highly recommend. TL;DR Delicious!"
"I had these in Finland and was very excited and happy to find them on Amazon.  They're just as I remembered, crispy and very good.  They're also healthy, which makes them a great choice for a snack.  I will definitely order more. TL;DR Delicious"
"I really enjoy these crackers, which are USDA green labeled organic. At least I know they aren't loaded with very questionable ingredients. TL;DR Better Snack"
"Fermented kefir beverage is good for my health maintenance. By following the instructions given by the Seller + with right  care,the water kefir grains will be reusable for an indefinite time. Hence, makes it an  affordable and cheap probiotic health beverage. I have been drinking daily since past three weeks after have received the grains that I bought from Cultures for Health via Amazon.com.  Services rendered by Amazon and Cultures for Health are fast and excellent. TL;DR Water Kefir Grain by Cultures for Health via Amazon"
"I think this coffee was delicious and I love that I'm wasting less plastic with it.  Once you open the pack of 12, you do want to put it in a ziploc bag to keep it fresh. My favorite part about this coffee was every time I opened the bag, it smelled so good. I've missed the smell of coffee with the usual K cups. I will definitely be buying more of this. TL;DR Love it!"
"I bought these thinking they would be a great low-calorie alternative to pasta, they were not even a good alternative. I prepared the noodles according to the directions and tossed them with my favorite pasta sauce. I took one bite and the rest went in the garbage. The texture was horrible. I suggest buying just one package to try before stocking up! TL;DR Gross!!!!"
"Love this product.  It is easy to make.  Serve with pork chops, brown gravy and vegetables.  Wonderful for a Sunday dinner. TL;DR Panni Potato Pancake Mix"
Same cereal I buy in the store for much less per unit.  Love this healthy cereal because it tastes good too.  Kind of a healthy Sugar Smacks. TL;DR yummy deal
Gave this as a gift to my mom who loves Jane Parker fruit cake. She enjoys both the light and dark fruit cake.  I also like this fruit cake because it is cake with fruit mixed in.  So happy you offer these because we can no longer buy Jane Parker brand at a local store. TL;DR reviewer
Not a bad soup mix. They make great gifts as well. The only problem I had was the expiration date was only seven months from the time of purchase. I was hoping to keep a couple of them a little longer because they are a great conversation piece. I can only imagine the conversation my friends must have after seeing Cock Flavored Soup Mix in my house. TL;DR The name says it all...
"Although it is a bit alarming to have these given a 5 star review by a cheesewhiz afficianado, (a condiment competing for most vile non-food item on the supermarket shelf imo), these actually are really fabulous. They have a mealy texture and great oaty/oily taste that is better than any other oat cake I have tried, and better than any other cracker too. My babies also love them and as non wheat products are suitable for the young and for the allergic. TL;DR Very tasty!"
"I normally bake from scratch but when I saw this pink lemonade cake mix with matching frosting I just had to try them both. This cake can be made two ways: with or without egg yolks. I recommend with as the cake will be nice and moist as a result. This cake would also be just as good with plain white icing or just a dusting of powdered sugar. You can make it as a layer, bundt, or sheet cake, or as cupcakes. I picked it up at the grocery store recently for about $1.80 per box, the frosting was about the same price per can. I ended up going back and purchasing more for later as I believe this is just a seasonal flavor and Pillsbury will pull it from the market at some point. If they do I hope they bring it back every spring. Until then I'll be stocking up. TL;DR Addictive"
"My favorite blend of my favorite coffee.  Used to have to smuggle a few pounds of the stuff back in my suitcase everytime I went out to the midwest! Now I can get in k-cups.  Yay! Good price on amazon, but super saver shipping takes forever! Fedexing it to the post office makes no sense.  just fedex it to me and shave 2 days off the wait already! TL;DR Best coffee ever"
"This is a very bad vendor who took my money but I never received the products!!! And won't do anything for you, no service at all!!! So if you don't want to take a chance please listen to my advice, I'd paid for this lesson!!! TL;DR Very bad merchant"
"I bought this coffee thinking I was getting some great deal for premium coffee after reading all the five star reviews.  Wrong!  very little flavor, bland taste.  Not sure why all the great reviews?  Waste of money. TL;DR Misleading reviews"
This is my favorite cereal. I thought it was a bargain and unlike some reviews; mine were not expired. I guess I'll have plenty of cereal for awhile! TL;DR Great Bargain
"I found the 6.8 ounce illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caffe to have a very good, rich and well balanced coffee taste. That biting, bracing espresso ""hit"" is there in spades.  The caffeine is eye opening and the serving size provides just enough for a little buzz. These drinks are not overly sweet, they have a great balance of flavors. TL;DR Nice Morning Shot"
"I consider this in the category of what should be quick, easy, edible food. However, the instructions are a bit more complicated than I like for food in this category. If I open this box, it is because I am short on time and need something quick and easy. However, here are the instructions:<br />1. Brown 1 pound of chicken (cut into 1 inch pieces) in a large skillet<br />2. Add 2 1/2 cps of water, seasoning and pasta. Bring to a boil<br />3. Cover and stir often for 7 minutes. Add broccoli; cover and cook until most of the water is gone, about 2 - 4 minutes. Remove from heat.<br />4. Add cheese with Velveeta cheese sauce pouch. Stir in cheese sauce<br /><br />Since some of those steps actually have multiple steps embedded inside them, this goes from and easy dump and heat meal to a more complicated recipe. For the same amount of work I can this same meal - just with fresh broccoli and ingredients I can actually pronounce.<br /><br />Now, I am no food snob - I actually enjoy the microwave version of the Velveeta broccoli and cheese pasta. Its just that the instructions for that meal is simply open the cup, dump in the broccoli dust, fill to line with water, microwave and stir in cheese sauce. For this amount of effort, the pretty much a similar product - I will pass in the future.<br /><br />Now, if you just really like the taste of Velveeta over other brands of ""cheese sauce"" and want a meal where all you have to do is add chicken - this is for you. However, this doesn't fit the bill for ""quick and easy"" and the flavor doesn't compare to fixing the same meal, in the same amount of time - with fresh or frozen broccoli and your own spices. Don't get me wrong, it isn't terrible; just not the ease I would be looking for in a box. TL;DR Okay, but a little more work than I like"
"For many years now, we have been able to enjoy real Italian prosciutto in the United States, but its close relative, salame, has been denied to us. For those of us who know about such things, American-made salame has been far, far off the mark, and barely worth eating. Now, while no real Italian products can yet be imported, three brands have filled the gap. Fra Mani, from the Napa Valley, is a good approximation, though unduly expensive, and Volpi from Saint Louis strikes close to the mark at a fair price. The real success story, however is Columbus of San Francisco, whose Artisan Collection is a joy. Salame, referred to in Italy by the broader term ""salumeria"", is a large family of superb dry-cured sausages, ranging from the tiny Cacciatorino (hunter's sausage) with its spicy and gamey taste, to Finocchiona, the Tuscan salame subtly flavored with fennel, to Soppressata, a coarse-grained delight from central Italy, and finally Felino, the incomparable Lombard specialty named for its town of origin. All these are now made by Columbus, and match the quality of their Italian counterparts. Try any one of them, and the illusion of false salame will be forever banished! Better still, fill a large platter with iced cantaloupe wedges, drape them with tissue-thin slicess of real prosciutto from Parma, and decorate the edges with medium-thick slices of one or more of the salami I have mentioned, and your friends and family will know true gourmet bliss! TL;DR Real Salame Here At Last"
"My son is allergic to wheat, dairy, eggs, soy, rice, and oats (plus more). It is nearly impossible to find cookies he can eat as almost all wheat free cookie recipes call for rice flour or oats. We were hesitant to try these because the Bob's wheat free brownies are pretty bad, but I'm SO glad we did! These were delicious and free of all of my son's allergens (the chocolate chips contain soy lecithin but his allergist said that does not contain enough soy protein to cause a reaction)! Not to mention so easy to make! It has directions for substituting the egg right on the package, and we used Earth Balance Soy Free Buttery Spread instead of butter. I did have to cook them for about 21 minutes instead of just 15 as the package states, but they outside is nice and crisp while the middles are still soft and delicious. I will definitely be buying this mix again!! TL;DR So yummy and so easy!!"
"Our dogs do NOT like this and won't eat it. Yes, they have no problem with the Libby's real canned pumpkin, but not this brand. TL;DR Not so good"
"Fantastic, fresh and flavorful...this is a morning staple in my household and always at an affordable price.<br /><br />Update: Unfortunately, in a move similar to gas prices, the price of the 4-pack original whole bean blend has increased more than $10.00 from a few months ago (it is now $26.78 with subscribe and save). This excellent coffee is no longer affordable. Why the substantial increase when other Eight O'Clock beans are still at the $15.53 subscribe and save price? TL;DR A Morning Staple"
"These cookies are soft and chewy just like you'd expect from Chips Ahoy, but they also contain gooey fudge inside.  They are definitely yummy and not too chocolatey, but I will say I expected more ""gooey"" from them and really inside the fudge is thicker and not really gooey at all.  Overall though they definitely satisfied my chocolate craving and I love that they were so soft. TL;DR Yummy Chocolate Cookies"
FAR better than any other gummies on the market. Great variety of flavors and they are perfectly soft. Shipped super quick. I will never buy any other gummies again. TL;DR Best Gummies EVER!
Halo is a good product but this flavor didn't do well with my dogs.  My older female had an upset stomach and lots of stools. TL;DR Didn't do well with my dog
All I can say is that our two dogs love these things almost more than anything else. They each get one a day and very much look forward to that special time. These long lasting treats are well worth the money for us. TL;DR Canine Testimonial
"I am a food bar junkie. I found these at Whole Foods about 6 months ago, and eat them regularly. I still havent got tired of them. I basically eat them as a meal supplement. I look for bars that taste good, are low in saturated fat, high in fiber, high in protein, and low in things like corn syrup and sodium. The Larabar product meets all these criteria. They are kind of unusual in their consistency though whic hmay turn some people off. They are quite dense in consistency, and some flavors also have a ""sticky"" consistency. The flavors are potent fresh and generally good. They taste like they are really made of the ""flavor"" on the label. Cherry taste like an actual cherry. Banana tastes like actual banana, etc.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Larabar is the best Food bar product, followed by Clif Bar, followed by PowerBar Harvest. TL;DR Still Love 'Em"
"In my trip through the health area of my local food market I stumbled upon Enjoy Life Boom Choco Boom Dark Chocolate Bar. I just can't resist trying things such as this. Into the cart it went. It's rather good. It says it's dairy, nut and soy free, and I'll take their word. The question is taste. Well, it's a good tasting bar. I have a couple others that I would regard higher. but this one is quite good. It's a bit high in calories (170 per bar) but has no cholesterol or sodium. Not bad. I'll pick it up again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson TL;DR No cholesterol. No Sodium. Not Very Sweet. Good Taste."
"My children taste tested these and only one of them liked them.  The cookies were crisp, so if you envisioned these to be like a soft, chewy fig newton cookie, that is something that you should know.  The picture on the front makes the cookie look softer than it actually is.<br /><br />The child that did like them also loves blueberries.  He gobbled the cookies up and asked for more.  The fruit bits aren't microscopic; you can actually see them in the cookie.  The cookies are very thin though and I don't know that they hold up well in milk.  They are thin, as advertised!<br /><br />They have no High Fructose Corn Syrup in them.  One other thing I would like to note is that when you open the package up, you can definitely smell the blueberry flavor.  It is fairly strong too. TL;DR Not your typical Newtons"
"It is nice to be able to determine myself how strong or weak I might want it. My daughter who is only 5 1/2 likes it as well. I like the fact that I can make a small cup for her, unlike some where you need to dump the contents into at least 16 oz of water. With this I can make it according to how much water I want to use. So I can give my daughter a small cup, or me a large cup. The taste is really nice as well. We also like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQGO"">MIO Orange Tangerine, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. TL;DR Very tasty and refreshing."
can get this at the local liquor store for a quarter of the price. The ants are small and its kinda cool. tastes like a jolly rancher TL;DR overpriced
"I love this coffee.  I'm a fan of lighter roasts.  I like the lack of bitterness and higher caffeine that comes with them.  This one is my favorite.  For most K-Cups, even lighter roasts, I have to run the machine twice through one K-Cup to get a decent, not overly-strong, cup of coffee.  These come out perfect for me with one run.  I do tend to go through them more quickly because of that, but that's okay. The great coffee is worth it! TL;DR Best K-Cup coffee for me!"
This stuff is so yummy and fairly healthy. I adore the cute little hotel sized containers. Perfect for keeping it fresh. My kids love it! Can't wait to try some other flavors. TL;DR Yummy!!
"As promised, these cookies are nice and soft, and they're chewy.  Those are the good points.  The bad points are that they don't have all that much flavor.  They also have a heavier consistency than what I would prefer.  These cookies would benefit from more of the kinds of spices that can make cookies tasty- cinnamon, nutmeg, and whatnot.  I'd be willing to try these in a chocolate chip or other chocolate version, as the chocolate would add some flavor value, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat these again. TL;DR Soft, but not very much flavor"
"These tomatoes make all the difference in a simple great sauce. I simmer them just a little to concentrate the flavors using olive oil, salt, and a pinch of Sicilian spice blend. At the end, toss in a little fresh basil. Great over pasta but best with my favorite - pizza Margherita.<br /><br />Some have commented on the condition of the cans; I've ordered these literally by the dozen and have received cans in perfect condition from the vendor Taylor's Market. TL;DR superlative san marzanos"
"I personally love this coffee, im a college student so i got this with a personal cup maker from black and decker and this coffee is one of my favorites, i drink coffee black not a big fan of cream and sugar.. but other than that this coffee is a good choice especially those trying to become black coffee drinkers TL;DR Great coffee with a hint of choclate"
"Dog enjoyed it. I did not enjoy, however, being in the same room with said dog afterwards. Is it the soy? Phew. My dog is gassy if she eats the wrong kibble.<br /><br />This has a lot of corn as well. And wheat. There are nice ingredients (beef, potatoes, green beans) but there is also poulty by-product meal and...yeah, corn. Which makes it cheaper. Sorry, dog, this won't be on the menu again any time soon.<br /><br />Ingredients: Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, salt, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, natural filet mignon flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color), sulfur, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate, choline chlo TL;DR Gas alert"
"I really like the frozen Corn Muffin Tops, but the mix resulted in a dryer product. I used the paper muffin liners and I think these might have added to the dryness. TL;DR The Muffin Tops Are Better"
I have tried all varieties of Metromint water save the Cherry Mint variety and I find all of them excellent.  I only wish this product was available in gallon sized containers.<br /><br />Metromint has managed to squeeze a lot of plavor into this unsweetened drink.  It is perfect on a hot day.  I highly recommend this product if you are a fan of unsweetened beverages and mint. TL;DR Refreshing
All of our S. African guests were thrilled with this authentic Biltong.  I was very pleased with how fast the shipping was.  Very happy customer! TL;DR Excellent!
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DGG8D"">Brussel's DT9049DCM Crepe Myrtle Bonsai</a> I was totally disappointed with this product! Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I ordered it, which taught me a lesson. The picture showed beautiful, purple flowers...when mine arrived, it barely had any leaves, let alone flowers! Also, the instructions that came with the ""plant"" said it was for outdoors, & there was nothing about that in the description. Amazon was wonderful about giving me a refund, but I think they probably had a lot of practice giving refunds for this one! I also learned not to order plants through the mail. I would not recomend this product. TL;DR Brussel's Crepe Myrtle Bonsai"
"Not only is this coffee a real eye opener, it tastes pretty damn good too! Simply put, you can't beat these beans for the money, full stop. TL;DR yum yum"
"I have a Hawaiian cookbook which requires passion fruit/lilikoi.  I cannot get this where I live in Thousand Oaks, CA.  I was thrilled to find this frozen puree and have been using it for my recipes.  It works great. TL;DR passion fruit in calif"
Wedderspoon Raw Organic Manuka Honey is an excellent product.  It has outstanding taste and appearance. It is one of the finest honeys I have ever tasted. TL;DR Review of Manuka honey
"This soup was pretty bland. Not gross, just not enough onion flavor for my taste. Also had to add more time than the instructions said because the noodles didnt cook. I may add an egg and some hotsauce next time, and see if that helps. TL;DR Not as good as I was expecting"
"I love my chubby cat. Which is why i wanted to get her to lose weight to ensure a nice long healthy and happy life. So when i went to target and saw these on sale i went for it. Ive fed her this for a year...trying out different portion sizes and playing a lot with my cat. Its been a year now and ive seen no difference..some people say she even got fatter. So i did research and not only did i find out that dry food was horrible for my cat, i was feeding her one of the worst brands! Its like feeding your cat sugary cereal. Not only will this food do nothing for weight except maybe increase it and screw up your cats health ive come to the conclusion that it gives her dandruff as well. When i finally switched to wellness a month ago her coat was nicer and she just looked better...i ran out and had to feed her left over iams in a rush..the next day she was covered in flakes and she only ever had dandruff when eating iams. So basically iams suck and this particular ""weight control"" sucks even more. If you care about your cats health switch brands and do some research. TL;DR CRAP"
"These are very dense breakfast bars that really stick with you and keep you from feeling hungry all morning. They're chewy too, so it takes awhile to finish. TL;DR Great when you're on the go -- just like the name says"
"Bought this orchid in August, now Oct. I have 2 sprigs of the most beautiful flowers i have ever seen. Also a wasp that looks just like the flower. I would highly recommend this seller. His product and delivery are excellent. TL;DR 5 star"
I love Eden products especially for the fact they use bpa free cans and they are gluten free. Might need a little cayenne pepper or added seasoning for those who are used to msg crap filled products. My delivery was fast but 4 cans were dented pretty bad. Not too big of a deal cause I can just cook em up this week but I was hoping to store these for longer periods of time. All in all I give it 4 stars. TL;DR Very healthy and tasty Chili!
"I read the marketing hype on the Tropical Traditions website and ordered this product through Amazon.  I'm quite disappointed - the taste is not great.  I have a jar of organic expeller-pressed unrefined coconut oil (which is supposed to be inferior to this Tropical Traditions Gold label) but tastes much better.  While I don't regret this purchase, because I needed a high-heat cooking oil (and the expeller-pressed oil that I have is only suitable for medium-heat cooking), my hopes are somewhat dashed.  I was hoping that I could use this Gold Label as a substitute for butter on toast, etc., but the taste is so bland it could not possibly substitute for butter on toast.  From the marketing hype, I would have thought the stuff tasted like liquid gold.  Nothing doing! TL;DR Probably fine, but doesn't live up to the hype"
"Our family loves this pasta.  It does not taste grainy, or like cardboard, like some other whole wheat pastas we have tried.  My young daughter would no longer eat whole wheat pasta as we'd tried so many bad ones...we convinced her to try this kind and she said it tasted just as good as the white, bleached pasta.  We love it! TL;DR Delicious"
"These are the best crackers ever.  Friends tell me they remind them of communion wafers, except that they taste fabulous.<br /><br />I bought them on Amazon instead of Whole Paycheck Foods for half the price.<br /><br />Enjoy! TL;DR better than the communion wafer, but the same thickness..."
I use this stuff most days during my workouts since it's a natural electrolyte replacement. It tastes good and keeps my energy up. TL;DR Yum!
I am not claiming I am a coffee expert or anything but I do like a nice cup of espresso or an Americano in the morning.  I use this bean with my Bialetti Brikka and I love the taste. TL;DR Love this bean!
"I ordered 2 4-packs of the Irish oatmeal.  The cans were poorly packed and were loose in the over-sized box with only inflatable air bags packing, therefore most of the 8 cans were dented. One can was bashed so badly that the rim became detached from the can, and some of the contents  spilled into the box.  While I love the oatmeal, I was very disappointed with the careless packing.  Items this heavy should be in a stronger box. TL;DR McCanns is the best, but. . . . . ."
"When people hear 'Jack Daniels', the first thing they usually think of is whiskey... so I was surprised when my dad offered me some sauce. I like BBQ sauce, but was blown away by this. Jack Daniels makes AWESOME sauce! I can't believe how good it was! It tastes great with a lot of things, it gives kick to a lot of foods like steak or chicken or whatever... YUM! Wow! TL;DR OMGGGGGG"
"I cannot stop eating this bread, it is so tasty, especially toasted. It is crumbly indeed, but it is the nature of rye breads. I toast it in the toaster oven for 5 or 6 minutes until the nuts start to look golden brown, and then let the bread cool for a couple of minutes. After this treatment the bread is much less likely to fall apart, and tastes great. TL;DR Feldkamp Whole Rye with Muesli Bread"
"The grass grows quickly and doesn't make a surrounding mess like the catnip grown in dirt.  Directions say the seeds need replaced every two weeks although they can last 3-4 weeks in my experience.  The cat thought it was OK and did chew on it occasionally but he didn't seem overly impressed.  Unfortunately, this product attracts gnat like bugs within the first 10-14 days.  It is messy to clean out and reseed plus wasteful to spend $4 every few weeks for the refill.  I used the initial seeds and purchased a 2-pack refill kit.  After cleaning it out the first time, I waited a few weeks before trying again.  The second time I used a water sensor to make sure I didn't add more water than necessary and also left the seeds in for only two weeks but had the same results.  Limited cat response, lots of bugs, 10 minute hassle to clean.  Just wasn't worth while for me. TL;DR Grows great grass plus Bugs!"
I found this blend about 4 years ago in Krogers.  I subsequently could not get it or find it in other grocery stores.  Looked online.  Found it.  Now I buy it online.  Love it.  Will get some more when I run out of this supply TL;DR PERFECT BLEND
"I came to Amazon looking for a good deal on Craisins in bulk.  I had been putting Craisins in the granola mix I make.  When I saw these cranberries were from my home state, I had to try them.  Glad I did.  So much plumper/jucier than the Craisins.  Since I use these in granola, the sugar content is fine.  I wouldn't eat them alone, as they are very sweet.  They'd go well with almonds, too, in a fruit/nut mix.  Like other reviewers, mine came in great condition.  I may try the dried cherries next! TL;DR Yum!  Much better than Craisins!"
I bought this at my local Middle East supermarket.It was priced very low and it makes sense that it isn't genuine olive oil.Probably a blend of various oils.Avoid and stick to more reputable brands. TL;DR Not Real Extra Virgin Olive Oil
"I just love,love,love Belly Flops! We just took a bag with us on vacation and saved a bundle by keeping my son out of the overpriced candy shops. We also made a game out of deciding what the 'joined' flops looked like. When three of them were joined there were some interesting shapes! TL;DR THESE ARE THE BEST!"
"We've tried chicken, cheese, and peanut butter. Sometimes the cookies are very small hearts and other times they are large hearts with chunks of oatmeal stuck in them. The smaller cookies are more tender and the large ones are a little harder to break apart. My dog isn't picky, so he's never had problems eating these. TL;DR DOOMHAMMER approved"
"The seller definitely cares about the plants sold, he contacted me to let me know around when they'd be there and what to do when they arrived. The package came with thorough, easy-to-follow instructions and the plants. It's been I think about 6-7 months since I got them and they're doing great! They're huge and colorful and active eaters. I have them in a little jar by the window. They grew a cool flower right after I got them. I will definitely buy more plants from this seller! TL;DR Love my flytrap!"
I tried this for the first time today and I enjoyed it. It had a mild but bold enough flavor for me that I could drink it in the am and have an afternoon cup  when feeling sluggish. No bitterness to it and the smell in the house when it was brewing was as if you were in a Caribou coffee estanlishment.I normally lean towards a more italian or french blend but I really like this. So a great medium roast if that is what you like. TL;DR Anytime of day coffee
This is so fabulous. I will definitly be ordering again. Arrrived quickly and quality was beyond my expectations. Thank you so much TL;DR Excellent
The amount of kefir grains was tiny. I ended up pitching them. They might be fine for those with the patience to grow them -- I wanted more than a few teaspoons of kefir. TL;DR Not a helpful amount of kefir
"Taste just like regular dried apricots but they are not sulphured so they are near black in colour.  If sulphur has bad effects for you, but you like dried apricots, this is a good choice. TL;DR UNSULPHURED and tasty"
"I first had fresh figs in Moscow. They were plump, juicy, fantastic. Thinking that I wanted more fresh figs without going back to Moscow, I ordered these on line. Bad move. They were terrible. Absolutely nothing like the ones I loved. We threw them out. I wanted to rate them a zero, but the program for these responses will not let me do that. TL;DR U.S. grown figs"
"I wouldn't buy this product again, it isn't bad chocolate, but it isn't great chocolate either.  Truthfully, Hershey's tastes much better.  The box is neat, so, if you're looking for a new type of gift for someone, then it is worth a try because it is German chocolate, especially for a child.  A child would enjoy this.  A chocolate lover would rather have Wockenfuss chocolates. TL;DR Kinder Chocolates"
"This is a generic review of all Dr. McDougall RightFoods food cups, not this specific one.<br /><br />UPDATE Feb 6, 2012:  Right-foods was bought-out by another company.  While the ingredients are still vegan, they aren't always organic anymore.<br /><br />I've been a customer of Dr. McDougall's Rightfoods for the past five years.  During this time, I've bought and tried every food cup that they offer.  The food cups are good for a quick snack or poured over pasta, rice, bread, or a baked potato.  The food cups are a bit pricy, but that's to be expected for a vegan, mostly-organic product that appeals to a relatively small market.<br /><br />Preparing a food cup is easy. Boil water, fill the cup to the line, stir, and let it stand for five minutes.  The cups (containers) themselves are 100% ""food grade"", meaning that no nasty chemicals are used in making them.  In each cup are the freeze-dried product (i.e. rice, vegetables), and a separate, sealed flavor packet (i.e. spices) in powder form.  The latter is a very good idea, as it keeps the powder mositure-free.  The ingredients are vegan (no animal products), often (but not always) organic (the product will be marked as organic if it is), low-fat, and moderately low in sodium.  Each flavor tastes more or less like what each represents.<br /><br />Understand that you won't be getting restaurant quality food here, nor will it be as good as homemade.  Neither is practical in a mass-produced freeze-dried product.  However, the taste is good under the circumstances.  My advice is to go to your local specialty foods store (many full-service supermarkets carry these---Wal Mart, of course does not) and buy one cup of each flavor to find out which you like.  If that's not possible, I would recommend buying only one case (6 cups) of each that interests you. TL;DR Good flavor for a vegan product"
"I agreed with all these rave reviews. BUT, maybe 6-8 months ago they changed this tea and ruined it. It is pathetic as lipton or any regular tea. I like a bold flavor with cream ""british style"" I, even, tried 2 tea bags and  it still did not taste the same. I have used this tea for years and am exremely picky about my tea. Having tea, is a big part of our family day. I have change to british PG TIPS tea or Irish Breakfast tea. It is not the same- but, they are pretty good. TL;DR THEY CHANGED IT"
"After purchasing some of the 3 moon at a local store, I was very impressed.  I liked it so much I decided to get a 5 lb bag.  Unfortunately what I got in the  5 pound bad was quite inferior to what I had purchased in the store (Earth Fare is where I purchased my two 1lb bags).  The 5 lb bag might as well have been labeled ""Stale Folgers"".  Really disappointed in the consistency of product quality. TL;DR Disappointed"
"I played it safe and only ordered 2 bags because I was ordering other stuff, and now I'm kicking myself!  My husband got a bag with all his favorites in it, mostly chocolate, and I got what I swear was a 40 flavor blend! Love the odd little shapes, and can't wait to buy more! TL;DR What a DEAL!!"
I'm brazilian and I grew up drinking coconut water not from the real coconut.<br />I have tried many different brands of coconut water in U.S and this is the closest I could get to the real thing. TL;DR Almost like the real thing.
"our baby was formula fed due to lack of breast milk production. Plus, there has been atlest 2 generations of children who were formula fed and are now gorwn up, proving that formula fed babies grow up same as those who are breat fed. PLs Don't hold me to that statement, If you can produce breast milk and have the  time, patience and strength to breast feed, I would much rather that my baby gets the natural breast milk than formula.<br /><br />Our baby started with Similac, which was given to us at the hospital, within a week, she was having gas and tummy issues, the pediatrician advised us to get the Similac sensitive, it seemed to work for a week, but then the tummy issues were back, she was having trouble passing gas and having BM's. we tried gas medicines such as mylicon and gripe water, but those were helpful only for a few hours. Then our friend recomended Enfamil gentlease. although it was a little more epxpensive ( a few cents here and there), we tried it, and now our baby is almost 3 moths with no problems in terms of gas or tummy issues. Its a huge help, and I would completely recomend it. I would also say it will depend from baby to baby.<br /><br />We did have a few days ( 2-3 days) of trouble when we switched to the different formulas, but that is the transition period. It does not work overnight, but when it does, its a big relief. TL;DR Enfamil better than Similac"
"I tried & tried & tried to breast feed & after hiring a lactation nurse, taking drugs from here & Canada ... Pumping every 2-3 hours with what looked like a car battery. I finally read in my studies & research that women with bad thyroids sometimes can not breast feed. So there you have it. Then I turned my research to formula & this one is by far the superior formula. My baby bear lives it. He actually likes it room temp. TL;DR If u have to use formula this is the best one By far!!!!!!!!"
"I first had this dessert(?) in Italy when our class had finished reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I enjoyed it then, and to my dismay, could not find it once I returned to the States. Then came the magic of the internet, where I finally found it!! It brought back wonderful memories. The taste is light and sweet. I am so happy to be able to order it whenever I want!!! TL;DR Absolutely delectable!!!!"
"well I dont know about the product itself, but i do know you are better off finding a local indian/asian/halal market in your are and buying from there. If you dont have one then this would be the way to go...a better one would be asking a relative that lives in a larger city to buy you some and ship it... TL;DR Good for those whitout an indian/asian/halal market nearby"
"I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results. I think the only reason why they are ""dental"" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can have soft sticky particles that will stay stuck to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them and probably do some good; just not as much as I expected for the price. Also there are tuns of vitamin in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 4 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as ""dental,"" they really should have enzymes or more prevalent dental ingredient. TL;DR decent, but not as ""dental"" as I expected"
"We tried the soft baked oatmeal raisin cookies and fell in love with them! Being a mom and constantly on the go its hard to find a great snack for the kids but these cookies come individually wrapped and fit easily in your diaper bag, purse, lunch box or car. I would recommend these to every one:) TL;DR Great for on the moms and they taste delicious!"
"I have tried several other, mostly Italian coffee blends. It's a rather mediocre blend compared to them. It appears to be not very fresh as its aroma is not as intensive as you could expect after opening the box. I wouldn't buy this blend again. TL;DR Mediocre coffee blend"
My son is on a GF diet for autism. His favorite food was Kraft mac & cheese. Since beginning the diet we have tried many other brands of boxed mac & cheese and my son only smells of them but won't eat. We have also tried 3 homemade versions but still won't eat. When I made this he ate 3 plates and the other three children really like it too. I've contacted Annie's to see if they will make other GF mixes. No others are planned soon. TL;DR Best GF mac & cheese
"My Irish Setter was always a difficult eater. He also had repeating issues with diarhhea and vomiting. He started on Inova, then we switched to Science Diet. The vet thought he might have food allergies and recommended this food. After 2 months there have been no issues with his stomach at all, and for the first time in his life he actually has an appetite. Also his coat is much better. This is great dog food. TL;DR Best dog food Ive used"
"If you are looking for coconut milk for making curries, this is the brand to buy. Mae Ploy brand is highly recommended also. Do not settle for less. Please search either of these two out! Warning: Shake the can before purchase. If it sloshes around like water - put it back. Chaokoh and Mae Ploy both are uniformly thick and creamy. Try to find the 19.5 oz can. TL;DR Search for this!"
"The chips are deliciously spicy and super crispy.  It takes a second for the heat to hit but<br />when it does, it's AWESOME!  Love these chips and will continue to buy for a long time. TL;DR Spicy, Hot Chips!"
"These are fantastic!  Super sweet though and they need to make bigger bags with more in it.  Expensive but nice for something special to snack on every once in awhile. TL;DR Very good, my favorite :)"
"My whole family loves these. Not just for babies. These are wholesome organic snacks. If you love bananas, then these are an excellent snack.<br />Great for the whole family any age. I plan to have these as a staple snack in our home. TL;DR For all ages! Got these for grandbabies & I plus my 8 & 11yr old  LOVE THESE  ORGANIC BANANA  FLAVORED CRIPSY PUFFS"
"I just tried the nutty marshmallow and it is awesome.<br />I have problems with some bars due to acid reflux and also gallbladder problems, but this hasn't bothered me yet. Plus at 150 calories it is a pretty lightweight snack, though a little small. Vegan too for those who want vegan treats. It's not made from real marshmallow root (which I was hoping for), but then almost no marshmallow snacks are. TL;DR Nutty Marshmallow rocks"
"This tea is awesome. It is the best artificial peach ice tea I've found. Unfortunately, it is not available in our area so guess where I looked first! And as always, Amazon came through. Really fast delivery. Comes in groups of four. Wish I had ordered more. I will next time. TL;DR Sipping Summertime"
"Several years ago I had bought a similar honey at a farm market, and loved how spreadable it was. When I went back to get more they no longer carried it, and I've been searching ever since.<br /><br />This has a beautiful floral honey taste to it, and it is perfect for spreading on toast. I know the two jars is going to last me a long time, so I hope Amazon is still carrying this when I'm ready to get some more for my cupboard. TL;DR So glad I found this!"
"After one can, I'm hooked on this cappuccino.  The taste of Illy Issimo is absolutely stellar.  The coffee itself is very good, the best I've had in a canned coffee.  It's the closest to a fresh iced coffee taste I've found.  The blend of coffee and milk in their cappuccino is just right, not too much milk and it's not too sweet, either. I found the caffeine to be pretty gentle.  The can says 81 mg of caffeine per can, which seemed high but I did not get the jitters or a crash later on.  At 100 calories a can, it's not going to ruin your diet, either.<br /><br />I've been buying various coffees in cans and jars for years, and had not yet found one I really loved. Another popular brand has a cappuccino which is far too sweet and an espresso which is overcaffeinated.  I hope to see this in local stores soon. TL;DR excellent canned coffee"
"I bought this to make chicken salad with.I am very happy with the quality of the taste,and texture,of this hormel canned chicken, it made a very tasty chicken salad.It was so good that there was none left!! i used two cans of this chicken and added two chopped boiled eggs along with diced pickles and mayo.I will buy this product again! TL;DR EXCELLENT,Quality,Taste"
"My Bichon Frise LOVES these treats.  They can be cut into smaller pieces for training.  My pup was potty trained easily with these treats as a bribe.  He sticks his nose in the air to ordinary milk bones, such a spoiled pooch. TL;DR Great training tool"
This is the best brand. Been a big fan for many years and glad amazon now stocks it at such a good price. Great with its hot sauce brand as a partner. TL;DR If you like seafood......
"This product is the best one that I have found for safety and actually works. Most anti-perspirants on the market contain dimethicone which is a very dangerous chemical to the body. The data safety sheet shows it to cause brain cancer and has actually been tested on humans. That's why I have stayed away from anti-perspirants for years. I finally gave up with plain deodorant and tried this product. Degree Girl Just Dance doesn't contain dimethicone so feel great using it!! I find that it works great for those who get smelly armpits. This makes my armpits stay nice and fresh. And trust me, just deodorant wasn't doing the trick. I'm a happy girl now! TL;DR One of the Safest Anti-Perspirants Available"
"Really, this is the best. Don't make the mistake of adding milk as it becomes pretty heavy. I have never bought a mix that I liked and just had to add water, oil and egg. Very easy to make and a great timesaver in the morning when everyone seems to hurry out the door. And it doesn't hurt one bit to support an employee owned business that stands for true quality. TL;DR The best pancake/waffle mis you can buy!"
"Thick and flavorful! This is a large bottle, but gets eaten up fast ! I buy 3 bottles at a time. TL;DR Amazing Flavor"
The sunbutter travel packs are so convenient and yummy. Not messy. I take when traveling as I No longer eat peanuts.<br />I got the creamy in the packs. I prefer the crunchy in the jars. TL;DR Sunbuttter is my new favorite treat
My husband brought this drink home just so I could try something different. I always request that he bring home Ting...I LOVE TING but I think I may have found another GREAT alternative. TL;DR This drink is AWESOME!!!!
"I wish my girls liked this one.  We have the Ernie and Cookie Monster ones and they love those.  I can't ""trick"" either of them into eating this one because it's so sour.  I've tried it too.  Won't be reordering this kind.  The others are great! TL;DR Sourest of the the smoothies"
"If you do not mind waiting for shipping (which was not long for me) than I fully recommend these bones and this seller. My local PetSmart has these same bones (different brand) for $19.99. My dogs, while usually well mannered, went absolutely nuts while I was trying to open the box and cellophane wrap. At the time of this review one dog has taken a break from mauling his bone and is taking a nap while the other is still going to town on his. All in all, both dogs are preoccupied and I am able to sit back and get some work done without interference or guilt of ignoring them. As others have mentioned, these bones do have a bit of a smell to them, however, I have never heard of a bone like these that do not smell. Also, what would make the dogs want a bone if they had no smell? TL;DR My local petsmart has the same bones (different brand) for $19.99"
"I lived in Italy for three years and enjoyed the juice of the Blood Orange many times, but I've never had such a delicious blend of three different varieties of blood orange.  If you like your juice very - extremely - tart, this is the one for you.  Buy it by the case - you'll be surprised by how quickly it goes once you have your first taste. TL;DR Best Orange Juice in the World!"
"I am a professionally trained chef and was taught how to put up jams, jellies and preserves by my grandmother almost 40 years ago. I go out of my way on many trips tasting and trying local cuisine hoping to find anything that would bring back memories of sampling my grandmother's creations. I have never found anything remotely close.<br /><br />But I have found something that surpasses Gram's by leaps and bounds!<br /><br />Chantal's Kitchens jams are purely decadent! Each taste reminds me of eating the fruit fresh right off the tree, and the combination! Wow! Organic Pear with Caramel & Rum! I could eat the entire jar just by itself! Make sure that you buy more than one jar, as the first jar will be gone before you know it!<br /><br />Tonight I'm using it on crepes with freshly churned vanilla bean ice cream! TL;DR Purely Decadent!"
"I used this Vidalia onion sauce as a BBQ kebob marinade. Try it by mixing it with 2 cubed pork necks, 2 medium onions (half rings) and 4-6oz of this onion sauce. Mix everything (pork neck cubes, onions and onion sauce) in the mixing bowl and leave it in covered in the fridge for 12 hours. TL;DR Excellent As BBQ Kebob Marinade"
"Ok,so I am writing a review for the original Yuban Coffee, but if you look at the dark roast you will see I wrote the first review on that one, to make a long story short we move a lot because of my husband's work, he is in aviation, we love Yuban and depending on what coast we are on we used to be able to get it or not.... Now that it is here on Amazon we never have to without it ever again no matter what coast we are on or anywhere in between....Thanks Amazon. TL;DR Best Coffee Ever"
"These are the best Ruffles there are... they taste like they have been literally dipped in cheese, the flavor is that strong and delicious. So addicting. My only question is, WHY are these so hard to find, and why can I never find the BIG BAGS?! TL;DR Like crack"
"Do not buy this ""coffee!""  I bought some at Walmart because of the price only to find that it's literally instant coffee in a K-Cup package.  Tastes awful.  Why buy an expensive single-cup dispenser only to use instant coffee???  This company should be shut down or sued for false advertising. TL;DR Instant Coffee!!!"
"These beans are yummy and smooth, like restaurant refried beans. I prefer these greatly to the canned variety. Flavorful and not too salty. TL;DR Tasty beans"
"... my cat insists that we give him MORE Kitty Kaviar. He has never loved a treat more than this one. The light flakes are easy for him to eat, and I don't have to worry about additives. He has a sensitive tummy, but these have never made him sick. They're worth the money. TL;DR Several times a day"
I have made two batches and had excellent results with the percentage of popped vs unpopped kernals.  I noted another reviewer had issues with the darker ones.  I did not.  Great yield.<br /><br />The flavor was terrific.  I haven't had old fashioned popcorn for a long time so am really only comparing to microwave type.  It was much better than microwave version.<br /><br />Tam TL;DR Terrific popcorn!
"I ordered this coffee because our staff requested a dark roast coffee. In particular,folks wanted something to help motivate and wake them up during early morning meetings because the flavored ones just didn't seen to have the punch in it needed for those early morning meetings. Well, this coffee was a hit and folks were purring and roaring and asking for me to order more. Great buy and great wake-me up! TL;DR Raoring feel good wake up for boost for sure!"
"Got it for one of my cats, because he had blood work done,and kidney showed something slight elevated,so vet suggested to get kidney diet food. Bought it dry and canned, dry goes well, but still ajusting to the canned food. TL;DR So far, so good !"
I used this good tasting Agave in pitchers of ice tea that we drink all year long.<br />It blends in qickly and tastes real good too.  Also enjoy it on fresh fruit because<br />it brings out the flavors of the fruit rather than overtake them. It's great on anything<br />you would like to bring a touch of sweetness to. TL;DR Madhava Organic Agave
"This is one of the best flavorings I've come across.  I've used it now for several years in various recipes....especially good in pound cakes and candied yams and some buttercream icings.<br />Lately, it's been hard to find in the local supermarkets.  I'm glad that I came on Amazon.com today,  they have everything! TL;DR McCormick's Imitation vanilla/butter/nut flavoring [extract]"
"These come from Merrick, which is known for their high quality treats for your dog.  This is a rich treat, so don't give half of it to your dog in one sitting or their will have loose stool.  My dog loves these, the only drawback is if they get wet they can get a little smelly.  But what doesn't after being in a dogs mouth? TL;DR Lamb treat for your dog"
"I think all three taste great, and I like that they are offered in one assorted package.  I tried a lemon/orange mix in water and it was delicious.  Can enhance any drink or meal!  Highly recommended to have these on hand, especially when getting to a fresh food store is not an easy option! TL;DR love all three"
"Love the Sparkling Ice.  Pink Grapefruit is very refreshing, especially in the warmer months.  Will be ordering more! Not sure which flavors I will try next.  Any suggestions? TL;DR Delicious!"
"I'm pretty sure that's what my cats are saying as they gobble this stuff up.  Neither one of my cats really liked soft food, but they love this stuff.  I like that it doesn't have that horrid cat food smell to it and I'm feeding them good stuff not a bunch of fillers and by products.  Their coats are looking great (soft, fluffy and shiny) since I've switched to this product and the Castor & Pollux indoor dry food. TL;DR Yummy..."
"The quality of the bamboo was very good.  The vase that was sent only partially resembled the picture on the website.  It was the same shape but was a lighter green, with little to no glazed sheen.  There was also no detail on the vase (the picture has a leaf sculpted onto the side of the vase).  The vase was definitely of a lower quality than what is pictured.  A good value but a little disappointing based on the picture.  You can understand that the vases will vary but to be such a substantial change in appearance from the picture is disappointing. TL;DR Great Bamboo; ok vase."
"Unfortunately i have a Great Dane so the dosage for what is considered a large breed always means I need to give a little more. But I am use to this dilemma as I'm sure any Dane or extra large dog breed owner is. other than that I find this product doesn't seem to make her dopey or drowsy rather just calmer, which is what i was looking for. In addition to increasing excersize this is great for separation anxiety treatment. I will be very happy to use this product regularly. TL;DR This is a good product if you don't want to dope up your dog."
I expected a basket and received a box.  Also I felt it was somewhat pricey when the shipping fee was added on.  I am hesitant to order anything else in the future. TL;DR Disappointed
"This is a delightful sparkling juice that is naturally refreshing. The lightly-carbonated drink has a lovely scent and color, courtesy of the blackberry juice. The portion is just right to make 1 glassful, and at 90 calories is a nice alternative to a regular, high calorie soda.<br /><br />There is no added sugar; all the flavor and calories come from the blackberry juice itself. I didn't think it was overly sweet, but my husband did.<br /><br />Now this isn't what I would call fruit juice. It's flavored water, and very nicely flavored as well! But for people (like me) who prefer their water to be 0 calories, 90 calories per serving may be too much, which is why I rated it only 4 stars. TL;DR Naturally Refreshing!"
"This is the same great coffee sold by Jewel food stores.  The price is lower than Jewel's best sale price, no tax and free delivery. TL;DR Great Coffee!  Great Price!"
I love the idea of these.  Each pack you can grab and go with and they stay fresh.  Great for campfire time and the perfect size for S'mores.  Stick a pack in a ziploc with a Hershey bar and marshmallows and you are ready to roast.  The others packs stay fresh until you are ready to eat them. TL;DR Yummy and Fresh
i have been using coffee beans to make expresso and in my french press. I really like the taste of this coffee. Family owed business grown in the USA. TL;DR great coffee
I have loved having our coffee delivered to our home it is easy and a lower price than the grocery store. TL;DR eight o'clock coffee subscription
Years ago this espresso was an acceptable blend with a bargain price.  For the past year or so it has been terrible.  I use a pump machine but I doubt that a drip maker would do any better.  I suspect they are buying reject beans to stay at the bottom of the price scale.  If you are looking for a budget brand try Bustello in the yellow can TL;DR Not a bargain
"I've been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn't. We finally tossed them.<br /><br />So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had. TL;DR taste just awful!"
"I eat these with various dips, and I find they're good with many flavors of dips.  These baked chips are crispy and heavily seasoned.  The seasoning is awesome and the cooks don't skimp.  Guiltless Gourmet is excellent for guests and for your splurging on healthy eats that taste better than processed.  I also recommend these to anyone who eats tortilla chips because these black bean chips blow the competition away. TL;DR 0g trans fat; made with organic corn"
When I received this I thought it was spotted rocks. They were hard with white spots all over them. Not edible at all. TL;DR Unrecognizable!
"Removes all the air from wine bottles, but also 2 liter soda bottles.  Such a wonderful idea and it really works well. TL;DR Best thing in the World!!!!"
Newman's own K-cups are the best i have tasted in about a year and a half of owning a Keurig. They brew strong but not bitter and don't  have the plastic/chemical taste of some k-cup blends. Great product. TL;DR favorite k-cup
"I love Eden brand beans. Much more affordable than in the store. I haven't had any dented cans of beans or any problems. So far, so good! TL;DR I love Eden brand"
"These are delicous!  I'm partial to the Anise, but all of the other flavors are good, too.  There are 120 calories per cookie and only 5g of sugar, and filling enough so that 1 is enough for a great little treat.  They are individually wrapped, so you don't have to eat the whole box before they go stale, unless you want to ;)  And the best part is, they have chunks of roasted almonds scattered about that are a delight when you hit one. TL;DR Perfect treat"
"Crystal Light Sunrise Tangerine Strawberry, is a very tasty low calory low carb substitute for juice.<br />I use it for making smoothies at home,<br /><br />Crystal Light, frozen whole strawberries blend on frozen drink mode.<br /><br />No need to add yogurt, sweetner or sherbert. (Since I'm old I throw in glucosamine, chewable vitamin C and fiber for mine, but I don't give that concoction to others!) You end up with  monster big smoothie while maintaining low calories and low carbs, very filling. TL;DR Delicious breakfast drink"
I bought these for my daughters Pink and Purple themed candy bar at her birthday party. They were a hit. So tasty. The bag was more then enough to fill a large vase. TL;DR So Yummy and such a great treat
"I haven't tried this but I'm told it is a great product line.  FYI the Seasonal Harvest Variety pack contains: three jars each of Pumpkin Apple, Apple Turkey Cranberry, Green Bean Casserole and Sweet Potato Cinnamon. TL;DR Recommended"
"it sounds good, chocolate chip cookies with a gooey chocolate center - what's not to like?  the reality was a mushy, piece of chocolate ganache that was coated in a thick, overly moist layer of cookie crumbs.  it was fine, but nothing spectacular. TL;DR mushy, tasty 'cookie'"
"My grandmother just gave me one of these, I am now hooked. I will probably be ordering a case, and give them out to my friends. TL;DR Steve Jackson"
"I got this for my dad for christmas. He opened the box and found there was only once chocolate covered pineapple slice...the title states ""slices"" which is misleading. TL;DR nice box, very little candy"
Wish these came in a smaller size for my dogs (English Cockers).  Yep they can eat them but they almost make a full meal.  I just started breaking them into 1/2 cookie and now they are a better size but could still be smaller.  High quality big cookie! TL;DR Big really Big
"PB2 is great.  A serving, 2 T of powder, is 1 point on Weight Watcher's Points Plus system.  Mixed with a tablespoon of water it makes something like peanut butter.  But even better is adding it to soups or smoothies for that peanut taste. TL;DR PB2 - Peanut Protein Powder"
"You can walk through the spice bazaar, through the streets and past the storefronts amidst the crowd and crush of Istanbul's market bazaar, until, near the Bosporus you come to the Mehmet Efendi window and smell the sweet scent of Turkey's greatest coffee.<br />What Illy is to Italy, Mehmet Efendi is to Turkey, and let's remember-the Turks started it! Oh, what sweet scents, what delicious varieties. I always bring home as much as my suitcase will carry. This year I may throw away all my clothes to make room for more Mehmet Efendi. Oh, and if you are not hitting Istanbul, isn't it nice that you can get it on Amazon? TL;DR Sweet experience"
"Having recently expanded my tea horizons here lately, I stumbled into toasted rice tea (by another organic company) that I positively fell head over heels in love with and concluded that I can't live the rest of my life without. In addition, the other tea I can't do without is green matcha. So, imagine my surprise when Amazon was selling this little beauty that is a mix of BOTH green matcha and toasted rice. So, I just HAD to give it a shot.<br /><br />I received it very quickly in the mail (thank you!) The tin is beautiful and the perfect size for storage but opening the tin was a bit (very!) difficult as the plastic protective seal was not perforated and sealed very(very!)tightly. It was hard to open even with a knife. I'm sure it was done to further ensure the freshness of product because the tea sealed by yet another interior lid (easy to open, with fingernails) and the actual tea leaves were inside of a foil pouch. Again, no perforation for easy opening and that foil pouch was bound by superglue, so it seemed. The reason I've knocked this tea down by a star --not user friendly.<br /><br />After I overcame these packaging challenges, I had to immediately test it out. The color of the matcha, sencha and rice were a brilliant vibrant green with a earthy, woodsy aroma. A good sign that this tea is high-quality.<br /><br />Immediately, I boiled some fresh water and made a cup for my mother and myself. The directions read to steep @ 165 temp and brew for 1.5 to 2 min. However, I brewed for longer since that was not strong enough. After about 5 minutes and a generous teaspoon of honey...decided to sit down and relax with this tea.<br /><br />The first thing I did was take a deep whiff of this beautiful aroma of earthy toastedness. That alone is worth buying the tea for. Then to actually drink it. WELLL...I'll be honest. It was a bit unusual at first but grew on me very quickly. In the end, it turned out to be a nutty, scrumptious green tea that was very satisfying. My mother could not detect what kind of tea it was, only making the comment that it was ""strange but good""  I will be adding this tea to my ever-growing rotation of ""favorite"" teas.<br /><br />So, the breakdown<br />5 Stars for taste and quality<br />3 Stars for directions on brewing<br />2 Stars for user-friendly packaging TL;DR Unusual yet very pleasant"
These are a better deal than in the grocery stores.  They're great little graham cracker type cookies. TL;DR yummm
You really can't go wrong with Britt coffee.  I had it for the first while traveling in Costa Rica and fell in love with it. I stuffed my luggage full of it!  I was thrilled to find out I could order it through Amazon.  Britt has spoiled my taste buds for anything else.  I highly recommend this coffee. TL;DR Great Coffee!
"Great product.  This snack does not have a blah flavor, but actually taste like popcorn.  Put a little calorie free butter spray, diet cheese,low fat cream cheese, or even a deli type lunch meat on it and you have the perfect low calorie snack that is better for you than the candy bar you grab most of the time.  Great addition to any diet to save calories and loose wieght. TL;DR real foods organic corn thins"
Ordered two sets of four boxes... last two shipments have been slightly crushed... and the one prior the inner bag was not sealed<br /><br />Vanilla Almond Product is my favorite!! TL;DR Love Product
"I purchased this specifically for using in my coffee, which I happen to like with a lot of cream & a lot of sugar (figuratively.)  I've been using Splenda for several years with great results and decided to give Stevia liquid a try considering there's just not enough information about whether sucralose (Splenda) is potentially harmful for you or not.  All I can say is YUCK!  Disgusting!!!  If you only use a little, you can hardly tell you've used any.  And if you use more it NEVER gets sweet, but instead turns bitter.  I'd rather drink non-sweetened coffee.  I'm not sure how this stuff works with cooking and other uses, but since I only purchased it specifically to use in my coffee...what a waste of my money!  YUCK YUCK YUCK. TL;DR Coffee lover is VERY disappointed!!!  YUCK!!!"
Worked better than the stuff a vet gave us for a problem that the dog chewed his skin off. This created a large bloody wound. The stuff we got from the vet required re-application daily but did not work all that well. This stuff was applied a couple of times at first and now once a week or 2 and all is well. TL;DR Better than Vet
"These cookies are delicious.  In our neck of the woods, they only have the giant Mallomars, so I really like the smaller size of these.  Everyone in our family loves them.  Not the cookies' fault, but these were mostly smashed to smithereens when we received them.  The box looked fine, but the cookies were broken and messy.  Luckily, I got them for us, not for someone else because I wouldn't have known they were all broken because the box was perfectly fine on the outside.  My advice would be to buy these in a local store, they don't ship well, at least the package I got didn't. TL;DR Yummy but squished"
"if u want a healthy soup this is it! the barley pieces are great, flavor good-great, overall excellent a great way to get barley TL;DR Love this soup"
"Probably the best packaged cookie we've tasted.  Better than the vanilla Oreo.  Good cookie and the filling is not to sweet.  We can't get them in the S.E., finally found them on Amazon. TL;DR GREAT Cookie"
"I am not a salt person - I'm on high blood pressure meds, yes, but have never been a big fan of salt except on french fries and onion rings (which I allow myself only infrequently) anyway.  It's hard to find good quality nuts of any kind that are unsalted.  These are first quality AND unsalted.  I eat them out of the can when I can't resist, but I mostly use them in stir-fry concoctions (the bottled sauces I use generally have way too much sodium all by themselves).  They are excellent with shrimp or with scallops.  Good stuff and the AMZN price (plus no tax and no shipping) makes them much more reasonable than local stores. TL;DR Just the best.  What else can you say?"
"My cats give this their approval.  It actually smells like human grade tuna, better than most cat grade tunas.  The package doesn't say, so I still wouldn't eat it, but it is definitely higher quality.  My cat that doesn't eat a lot of her food scarfed this down and immediately started eating the other cats serving.<br /><br />This is a treat.  It doesn't have all the nutrition cats need (it is like feeding your cat human tuna, you can't feed only that).  I would buy this again as a treat. TL;DR Cats Like it, smells like Tuna"
"These crackers are great with cheese, with soup or with salad. They are a substantial cracker that will hold the press of your knife to spread butter or soft cheese.  I am never without these and the black sesame variety of this brand as they are also gluten free. My guests rave about the nutty flavor and want to know where I get these crackers. TL;DR Great Crunch"
"This was my first time ordering organic spices, and I am very pleased. It is very fresh smelling, and tasted great! I love to use cumin in mexican and indian dishes. I'm storing mine in the fridge, because I want it to stay fresh, and it is a very large container. Great healthy product and a good value. TL;DR Wonderful!"
"Fast service and shipping.  These little k cups are great as you can use any kind of coffee or tea that you like, at a much reduced price over regular k-cups.  Easy to use no mess, what's not to like.  If you have coffee maker that uses k-cups you have to try these, it puts you back in control of drinking the kind of coffee you like. TL;DR Disposakups are great"
"I've been craving this flavor during my pregnancy, so I was very excited to see these crisps on here for such a great price!  I ordered two sets of six (12 total packets) and they arrived within a week.  They were well packaged and protected for shipping, so the actual crisps were not broken into dust.  My only complaint was the price of the shipping - I think I would order them again if it weren't for the extra cost. TL;DR Excellent product and service"
"The product was fine--they are good enough diced tomatoes, but when they arrived they were so dented that we could only use about three of the cans. I don't think we'll buy canned goods from Amazon again. TL;DR very poor shipping"
It's true that these don't taste like fresh ones you bake yourself.  But when is a pre-packaged food ever the same as fresh?  These are an awesome alternative to potato chips.  I share them with a couple friends at work and they rarely last more than 1 day.  They are very tasty and addictive.  Just make sure you have a mirror handy or don't smile until you get to a rest room. TL;DR Delicious!
Plochman's mustard is great.  One of the best stone ground mustards I have tasted. TL;DR plochman mustard
"This salt is very very 'salty' with a somewhat bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />There are better products (search for South African East Coast sea salt).<br /><br />I much prefer Maldon's, which is hardly gourmet. TL;DR Not impressed"
"I have been using this for almost a year. Water gets boring and hard to drink, this is a great way to help you drink more. I really like this berry flavor. Keep in mind, small amount goes a long way, I use 1/2 a dropper full to flavor 32 oz of water. I also have the toffee for coffee. TL;DR Great way to get more water!"
"My kitty loves Merrick Grammy's Pot Pie, Thanksgiving Day Dinner, and Turducken. All seem to be high quality foods, and lots cheaper from Amazon than they are locally. TL;DR My kitty loves Merrick"
"When I originally reviewed the 12-pack of these, they were 30% more expensive than elsewhere, but now, via subscription, this is a better price than I can get at any store.  They are as fresh or fresher than those bought in stores, and each unit of four six-bar packages is sealed in heavy-duty plastic.  Delivery is prompt as well.  I agree with the ""Leading consumer magazine"" that rated these to be the best of all granola bars.  They have no cheap, unhealthy ingredients -- just stuff that tastes great and is good for us, barring allergies. TL;DR Best granola bars of all and now cheaper than elsewhere"
"I searched high and low for authentic Jerk Seasoning. Nothing comes closer to the Pork Pit in Montego Bay, Jamaica than this seasoning. It used to be called Tone's Jamaican Jerk Seasoning but the company has rebranded it. Fear not, this is THE REAL DEAL! TL;DR Formerly Tone's Jamaican Jerk Seasoning"
"this is the only breakfast my husband eats routinely during the week/ on the weekend I will cook him a traditional sunday breakfast/ usually he will eat both because his dog will only eat her breakfast after he shares the oatmeal dreggs/ he only likes the oatmeal with brown sugar--sweet yet not too sweet and easy enough for him to just put into the microwave.  The ""instant brown sugar oatmeal in a cup"" TL;DR yum-yum breakfast"
"This is sweetgourmet.com branded licorice, not Kookaburra brand. Buyer beware. Very misleading advertising. It was fulfilled by Amazon, so I am even more disappointed. TL;DR This is not Kookaburra brand licorice"
"Love ordering from Amazon - with affordable shipping, you get great products at a reasonable price delivered FAST.<br />We love a bold flavorful coffee, this is it!  Not too much acid, no bitterness. Just delicious, rich coffee. TL;DR Strong Delicious Coffee - Fantastic Price"
"I love orange coffee and it is simply becoming impossible to get anymore.  I have been in withdrawl for years and a friend found this on Amazon, so I paid my money and took me chances and was very pleasantly surprised.  The smell is terrific while brewing and the smell takes me back to the days when the kids were first born and working every spare minute on a fixer-upper.  The taste is even better!  I am actually writing this review as I am purchasing another 5 pound bag so I never have to go without ever again!!! TL;DR Orange Coffee...It's the BEST!"
"My boyfriend and I love Yogi teas, and this sampler is the perfect way to get a variety of teas for a good price. I particularly like the Calming and Chamomile teas, and he likes the Bedtime - it really relaxes him and helps him fall asleep. The Kava tea is pretty strong stuff, but it's helpful if you really need to be knocked out. I agree that some of the teas have a unique taste because of the herbs, so may want to try a box from your local grocery store before investing in this pack. TL;DR Great mix of teas"
"This mustard seed is great for rubs or for pickling and braising roasts.<br /><br />If you want to grind this for mustard and want to make a really 'smooth' mustard, grind it as fine as you can in your spice grinder and then sift the mustard bran out with a fine mesh colander. If you want that pretty 'bright' yellow color, just add a pinch or two of powdered turmeric.<br /><br />This spice was packaged nicely in well-sealed foil bags. This mustard seed was very uniform, clean and debris free.<br /><br />Edited to add [March 31, 2012]:<br /><br />This is NOT hot mustard. This is a very mild mustard much like your typical American 'hot dog' mustard. No 'bite' or 'kick' to it. Very nice flavor though despite not being hot. TL;DR Excellent quality organic mustard seed"
"This is by far the best bread product for celiacs if you can have cheese.<br />Any kind of cheese makes this mix tasty.  As someone who doesn't like to cook, I am thrilled with the ten minute prep time and 25 minute baking time.  My house smells fabulous, I get fresh bread, and hello sandwiches!!!  Something I love and hadn't had in over two years as I have MANY other food allergies, including yeast and rice, so all other celiac bread options I found were not suitable for me.<br />As for the directions, I find it easier to add the baking soda to the mix and THEN mix all wet ingredients together BEFORE adding to the mix.  Incorporate wet ingredients and then knead.  Then add the cheese and continue to knead.  I bake rolls at 375 for 25 minutes and they are moist and a bit chewy.  I find 35 minutes is too long.<br />There is no sales tax on Amazon and this is a MUCH better price than in my local supermarkets or health food stores.  I will only order Chebe from Amazon if the price stays this reasonable. TL;DR The REAL ""Wonder Bread"""
"Ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly invasion. The amazon shipping was acceptable, but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment, unless they were to put ""This side up"" on the box. The dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant (Audrey) was upside down, roots up in the box. If I had found one locally I would have bought it there. Hoping Audrey survives, but I don't have high hopes.<br />EDIT: Audrey is now deceased. Do not recommend. TL;DR Not packaged for shipment"
"This great instant expresso is truly sensational & in a class by itself !! What makes this so special is not only the fabulous taste, but its powdered form, making it versatile for baking, making truffles, chocolates, and is easily blended in iced coffee beverages. I have tried many other instant expresso coffees and the others are mostly freeze dried, so the taste is not as good & it does not blend well in iced coffees or as versatile for baking or truffle making. It is reasonably priced on Amazon & I go into withdrawal without my Medaglia D'Oro ! TL;DR HANDS DOWN FAVORITE INSTANT COFFEE I ALWAYS COME BACK TO"
"I don't know who's in charge of watching out for mislabeled products, but I was very annoyed after searching amazon for ""flushable cat litter"" and ordering the first thing on the list, just to find out it's not flushable. Not only is it not flushable, it's about the least flushable cat litter I've ever seen. My cats hate it, and refuse to use it. One of my cat is running around frantically crying because he doesn't know whats going on with his litter. Worst litter product I have ever seen. Do not buy. TL;DR This is NOT flushable!"
"These are great to have!  I toss one in my daughter's lunch...have a few in my purse for a ""pick"" me up, etc.  Tasty, tasty!  Other people are so curious when I whip one out.  They are amazed it's a straw filled with honey.  This is the place to find the best price on these honey sticks.  Thanks for having them on subscribe and save.  Great program! TL;DR Sweet DEAL!"
"If I have a sore throat and starting to feel a little achy, I reach for a hot cup of the Dry Desert Lime.  I don't know if the effect is purely in my head, but it seems to make me feel quite a bit better.  There have been several days where drinking this allowed me to feel well enough to stay at work rather than go home and take a sick day.<br />The taste is unique, and the smell is amazing.  A single packet of sweetener perks up the taste even more.<br />I tried the collection variety pack, and this was definitely the standout tea of the bunch.  Many of the others were not particularly special, good but no different than Tazo or other brands, but this one makes me believe some of the hype about Numi teas.  It's worthwhile buying a box of this, every cup is enjoyable. TL;DR Great for Under the Weather Days"
Love the King Leo mints.  They are delicious and worth every penny.  Fast shipping and sturdy packaging.  Everyone should enjoy these wonderful candies. TL;DR Best mints ever!
"Its nice being able to get rye flour overseas. And the size is right as well as the price. I only use a little less than a cup of this to make three loaves of sourdough bread about twice a week, so it lasts me a while, but I'll have it gone and ordered another pack by the time the sixth month comes, so it will remain reasonably fresh. Don't know what else to say about flour, it works and tastes great. I'll give it a five, just for being available. TL;DR Great Rye Flour"
"A smooth, bold coffee with a great flavor. It has become my favorite for mornings. No burnt taste as is often found in some other dark roasts.  Timothy's does a great job on this coffee. TL;DR Smooth and Bold"
"Cool idea for a product but the one I got is junk unless you don't mind a meat thermometer that jumps from 60 deg to 299 deg and back again within a few seconds and alarms every time it give an erroneously high reading, which is every few minutes.<br /><br />I purchased this product for my Father who has used it twice.  We tried all the tricks to get it to work, reset the transmitter and receiver, fresh batteries, moved the meat probe, etc.  Nothing worked.<br /><br />It has been more than 90 days since I ordered this product, so I called the Brookstone Limited Warranty Service at the 800 number listed in the manual.  A very nice but obviously frustrated gal tried for 25 minutes to find my order in the system but couldn't pull it off.  I asked her if she could just add me to the system since I obviously had a Brookstone product and a receipt from Amazon.  She said no, it doesn't work that way.  After speaking to her supervisor I was told I needed to contact Amazon for support.  Amazon said I had to contact the seller, TLC Stores.  I sent a email to TLC stores, well see what they say.<br /><br />As of this posting I have spent $65.98 for a product that doesn't work and over an hour and counting trying to get warranty service.<br /><br />For now I would say STAY AWAY FROM BROOKSTONE PRODUCTS!  My, albeit limited, experience has not been a positive one.<br /><br />If the situation is resolved I will update this posting and let everyone know the results of my quest for even marginally adequate customer service.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/27/11<br /><br />Brookstone will not warranty this item because I purchased it from TLC Store (amazon seller).  Brookstone only warranties their items to the ""original purchaser"".  Brookstone told me that by purchase this item from TLC Store ""you effective bought this item at a garage sale from the original purchaser so the warranty is null and void.""  I purchased this item thinking it was ""new"" with a warranty to back it up.  TLC Store has a 30 day warranty, or so I am told.  This effective took the 1 yr manufacture warranty and turned it into a 30 day warranty from some gal selling stuff from her garage.  I sent repeated emails but only received two replies neither of them came close to resolving the issue.<br /><br />Bottom line, this item is junk.  TLC Store has done nothing to help rectify the problem.<br /><br />2 LESSONS LEARNED<br />  1.  THIS BROOKSTONE PRODUCT IS JUNK AND THEY ARE UNWILLING TO BACKUP THEIR PRODUCTS.<br /><br />  2.  ANYONE CAN SET UP AN AMAZON STORE FRONT.  BUYER BEWARE, YOU MAY BE BUYING STUFF FROM SOMEONE'S GARAGE WHO<br />  IS JUST TRYING TO MAKE A BUCK AND DOESN'T CARE IF YOU GET SCREWED IN THE PROCESS. TL;DR JUNK!!!! Brookstone is not helping with warranty issues..."
"With a legendary name like Gevalia, I was disappointed to find that the coffee contains artificial flavors.  The outside packaging looks gourmet and epicurean, with gold lettering.  Unfortunately, artificial flavoring also plainly occupies the front face.<br /><br />The aroma from the coffee is quite pleasant, however, after brewing, the coffee itself is nothing to write home about.  In fact, it tasted rather bitter.<br /><br />I would not buy this item. TL;DR Artificial flavor...?!"
"If you are a mushroom lover you are in for a treat. For a dry soup that comes in a cardboard bowl all I can say is ""Wow"". Just chucked full of mushrooms and clear noodles with a full rich flavor. I'll reorder again for sure.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0028P8H82"">Crystal Noodle 6 Kinds of Mushrooms, 1.90 Ounce Cardboard Cup (Pack of 6)</a> TL;DR You are going to love it."
This Lingonberry jam is delicioous. It has a very palatable taste and mixes well with a variety of foods. I mix it in oatmeal and cereal. TL;DR KnockRose
"UPDATE: No word on the kibble size, however the 16 lb. size lasted about 6 - 7 weeks for my Westie. Then the remaining 1/4 bag turned moldy. If you have a small dog, stay with the 8 lb. bag!<br /><br />My 11 yr. old Westie loves this food. His breed suffers from skin issues. We see improvement with his skin, he's more lively - and he's definitely more enthusiastic about eating!<br /><br />I bought the 8 lb. bag to try it. This time I bought the 16 lb. bag. There's a big difference in the kibble size with the 16 lb. being not quite double - but significantly bigger. Westies are not big dogs. He's doing okay with it. I've contacted Laughing Dog to see if that's normal. I didn't see a difference in the product description or on the bag - unless I'm missing something.<br /><br />Anyway - great product! I feel better knowing he's getting good natural ingredients and extra nutrition. TL;DR Kibble size - 8 lb. vs. 16 lb. bag"
It never caught even one fly.  We got it for inside and left it out for a week.  The flies were not interested.  It's Useless! TL;DR It's junk
"It's been about a 1-1/2 years since my first review of the Big Chew and I'm happy to report that it is still going strong with our dog. It definitely shows sign of wear and tear but it's obvious that this bone will be around for a long time. Definitely a must chew toy for your mega-jaw dog. Doggie approved and mama's wallet is happy.<br /><br />* * * *<br /><br />I've nicknamed my dog ""The Mutilator"" because there are VERY few toys that he cannot destroy in 10 minutes or less. The Mutilator means business when it comes to his high-prey playtime.<br /><br />Needless to say, I have become a skeptic when it comes to ""tough"" toys. Nonetheless, even though he has mutilated toys that look similar to Big Chews, I decided to give this one a shot.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that after one month of full-time mutilator mode, our chow/lab/st bernard mix has barely made a dent in his Big Chew beef bone. I'm a believer! The only problem I have now is keeping him away from the couch cushions when he can't remember where he hid his Big Chew. :) TL;DR Mutilator Approved!"
"We just received one of these from Amazon after having bought Cooper's cans of ME here in the past without incident. Unlike the canned ME, which is just an OK deal, this is a better deal on dry ME per pound than I'd found anywhere, so naturally we were quite excited. It came shipped as a bag inside a Cooper's cardboard box inside an Amazon shipping box. However, the inner Cooper's box had been opened (it had been previously taped, and I cannot imagine why Cooper's would ship these unsealed) and the bag did not seem to be factory sealed, either. Rather, the bag was loosely tied in a knot at the top end, and the dry ME within the bag, just beneath the knot, was caked up inside the bag under the knot as if water had gotten into the bag. There was also some dried ME that had gotten wet around the outside of the bag by the knot. I'm posting this review to find out if others have had the same experience with this before I send it back (if I should bother demanding a replacement or not), but mine has been previously opened and exposed to water or other liquid, so I really cannot recommend this.. TL;DR What is going on with the packaging?"
"I keep this  in my regular rotation of Keurig bold coffees from Amazon thru their ""subscribe and save"" program.<br />One of my favorites.  Glad they just switched to the frustration free packaging too. TL;DR Emeril's Bold - great cup of coffee"
I like Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter but the struggle with mixing it in the jar was annoying. Smuckers advertised this item on their site but Amazon has a better price with free shipping.<br /><br />this takes most of the sweat and time out of the process and all of the mess. TL;DR Very Nice Tool
I have used these before but the prices in the local stores are outrageous. I was vry satisfid with the price and how quick it got here. I don't use a lot of these - thank goodness - but if needed again I will not hesitate to order from Hooves & Paws via Amazon. TL;DR Excellent service and price
"I really really like this cereal because it's very filling and doesn't have added sugars like most cereals on the market.  I love how it is very nutrient dense and holds me over for hours.  It is somewhat bland with a nice hint of cinnamon, but I don't like things that are overly sweet.  I just wish it came in a larger package and wasn't so expensive.  I have about 1/4 to 1/2 cup with each serving, but it didn't last me more than about 8 days =/ TL;DR great cereal"
If you are really into chai latte's at Starbucks than this is what you need to get since it is the same chai concentrate mixture the mermaid people use. I do find it a bit overpriced. Starbucks stopped selling it a couple of years back and outside of big wholesale retailers it is pretty hard to find. TL;DR Great Tasting Product but Overpriced
"Any of Ambrosial's products is hands down the best breakfast I've ever had!  Interesting menagerie of ingredients, super yummy and organic.  I have yet to find a comparable cereal that gets me going in the morning and i keep a bag in my office as a dry snack during the work day.<br /><br />Also, the company is so sweet.  I don't normally write reviews, but when I wrote a thank you letter to Anastasia at the company, they sent me a small complementary selection of their product.  Rare to find such a good company and product ethos.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Barry TL;DR True granola!"
"We're heavy K cup users at our house, and always look forward to trying new types. I was excited to see this one listed, and ordered right away.  Wow! What a disappointment! When I opened the box, there was loose coffee all over the place, and the lids look like someone sat in front of their tv and glued them on by hand. So ok, I could probably have lived with that, but when I brewed it, it was terrible--nothing like any of the others on the market. It just tasted like old stale coffee.  I tried to return it, and it's not returnable.  If you want to try an ""off-brand"" of K cup, try the San Franscisco Fog Chaser--it's not actually a K cup but fits into the Keurig and the coffee is good.  As far as the Brooklyn one, fuggetaboutit! TL;DR Forgetabout it is right! Save your money!"
"I have been studying all the benefits of coconut oil and wanted to get the best one. I use it in place of lotion, hair conditioning (leave on 20 minutes and wash your hair) and cooking. It is soooooo awesome I love the smell and my skin and hair look great. I had decided to get away from harmful chemicals and back to basics I put some in a little  pump bottle and no more lotion in my bathroom , even my hubby is using it now. I am like the church of coconut oil now. This bottle will last a year so it saves money too. TL;DR Awesome"
I love these! The cherries taste wonderful and I keep them in the fridge for whenever I need a snack! TL;DR Traverse Bay Dried Cherries
"We haven't opened the jar yet, but the label gives more information than the company's web site does. Water is listed as the first ingredient, then ""smoked herring 40%,"" followed by cuttlefish, salt, potato starch, and other ingredients. It would be useful if the online descriptions were at least as clear as the labels. TL;DR Only 40% herring"
"This may not be ""real"" cappuccino, but I am not sure I know what that is.  This tastes good and I really enjoy a cup of it, especially on these chilly mornings. TL;DR Tasty!"
Dogs just go crazy over these treats.  I go online and buy 2 cases of 12 and that lasts 2 years for my 2 pugs and 1 yorkie. TL;DR Dogs will love you for this!
"Great sugar for coffee.  A little harder to use in cooking at times due to the larger granules but can lead to interesting results.  If you need sugar for a quick caramel, like the basis for a gastrique it really works well. TL;DR Great in coffee"
"Purchased these to use a part of a gift backet item.  Of course, tried a can before gifting to make sure what we were giving was good.  It was.  Item was well received in gift basket with recipients asking ""where"" they could purchase the delicious nuts.  I told them.......""Amazon.com""! TL;DR These are delicious."
"This polenta is easy to make and has wonderful texture and flavor.  I usually add a bit more than 3 tbls of cheese, but even without cheese - this is a tasty polenta.  And the fact that is organic and cooks in a very short amount of time is just a huge bonus. TL;DR Deeeeeeeeelicious!"
Thank u I will buy again it was for my ladys nite and everone loved it I order it on a Monday an it can the nexted day again I will b ordering this again TL;DR LOVED IT
"I don't know why cats need ""treats,"" but I got some sample size packets of this product in with my regular shipment of Wellness cat food, and offered them to my two cats. One is usually game to try anything and begs for human food, the other has thrived on Wellness wet and dry food, but is not adventurous about trying other brands.<br /><br />I have never seen a reaction like this to dry kibble before with either these or any of my previous cats. One bite and they were hooked! Now whenever they hear the cellophane packaging being opened, they come running and meowing. They don't seem to bite or chew the stuff, just swallow it down.<br /><br />I haven't noticed any of the digestive upsets others here blame on the product.  Still, I'm not convinced it's a food I'd want to feed regularly; the ingredients don't impress me, which is why I deducted one star. I guess it'll be off to kitty rehab for my two addicts when the freebies run out. TL;DR It's like kitty crack"
"This sauce is not too spicy, but has a delicious barbecue-like flavor. Perfect on nachos, hamburgers, pasta, and more. TL;DR Best hot sauce ever."
"Super fast shipping, even included a couple trial treats.  Our dog loves these and we'll be purchasing them again! TL;DR Our dog loves her Greenies!"
"My 2 year old loves this milk, drinking at least 1 per day for the past 2-3 weeks.  He began having digestive issues and complaining of belly aches, so I googled the ingredient listed as carrageenan.  It's a ""natural"" thickening agent used in soy milk and other organic products that causes many people to experience the same symptoms my son has experienced.  In fact, many people who drink certain brands of soy milk containing carrageenan mistakenly attribute their digestive problems to the soy, when it's actually the carrageenan.<br /><br />IS CARRAGEENAN REALLY NATURAL?<br /><br />Carrageenan is about as wholesome as monosodium<br />glutamate (MSG), which is extracted from rice, and can<br />equally be considered natural. Aspartame (NutraPoison)<br />is also natural, as it is extracted from decayed plant<br />matter that has been underground for millions of years<br />(oil). So too are many other substances such as<br />carrageenan that can also be classified by FDA and<br />USDA as wholesome and natural food additives.<br /><br />Just because something comes from a natural source<br />does not mean that it is safe.<br /><br />Organic?  What a joke. Horizon and the conglomerate that owns this factory farm should be ashamed of themselves. TL;DR Beware of carrageenan ingredient"
I've had success with the Numi black tea and wanted to try the green. The reviews suggested this tea and I'm glad I tried it. The aroma is wonderful and the taste is mild and clean. TL;DR Wonderful aroma.
"I love this gum.  It's crisp and I can ""crack"" it in my mouth- not too soft in texture.  The flavor lasts a long time and even though it's a ""chewing gum"" I can blow bubbles with it.  I really don't know why Trident would want to discontinue it. TL;DR LOVE this gum!"
"At $5 per pack, I think this product is too expensive. But if the price is not an issue, the taste is great. Wonderful in cold salads with a balsamic vinegar and olive oil dressing. Will look for a cheaper alternative. TL;DR A Great Product But Expensive"
"Great for camping and on the road drink mix you can add to a bottle of water shake and go OR mix in a pitcher. No worries about bringing sugar, it's already added. My only hang up is the pineapple flavor has an artificial after taste that made me look at the ingredients for an artificial sweetener - ASPARTAME was found.<br /><br />The warning for  phenylalanine is one the package BUT not in the description here. Zuko's tropical flavors are appealing though and just an OK value buy at 15 bucks. TL;DR Quick Dissolving and Easy Mixing"
"at $12 for 2.1 ounces, no wonder one can't pull up the bag to see details.<br />Like $80 per pound! TL;DR a little pricy; no details on bag"
Great Rub. Bought this and will buy again. Company makes great products. I have used many including the paprika and garlic powder. Great product order now!!!! TL;DR Best chicken season ever
This is great you can use for cakes and pie crust. and they taste great. TL;DR Great for alot of stuff
What is the point of using xylitol if you are going to put nasty toxic crap like artificial colors in here??!! very annoying! TL;DR NOT healthy
"If you have ever stayed at a Hilton property or a Comfort Inn, this is the same waffle mix they use. It took me about two weeks to track it down but I finally found it and I'm not sorry I did. It is the best tasting waffle mix ever. TL;DR Great Flavor"
"UPDATE:<br />The reason these beans are dryer and less oily is because these are light to medium roasted beans! Darker roasts are oilier and wetter looking, the darker the roast the oilier (and more burnt tasting) the coffee will be...<br /><br />I like this coffee and have ordered 3 lots already. Anybody who does not like dark roasts should like this coffee.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />----------------<br />The bag I received was a medium roast, though it doesn't specify any particular roast on the package.<br /><br />This coffee (Guatemalan) has a fruity flavor.<br /><br />It's organic as well as fair trade.<br /><br />This brand is a good price for organic coffee. TL;DR Fruity flavor medium roast"
You will need the kit with the ceramic bake dishes for this mix.  It's wonderfully chocolate.  Very easy & everyone asks for the recipe. TL;DR Lava Cake
I just tried popchips for the first time and they were great!  I immediately went online to find them and order more.  Only 100 calories in the .8 ounce bag - makes for a great afternoon snack at the office. TL;DR Yummy!
"The foil packs keep the powder fresh. this particular flavor, tastes, like it sounds. I can honestly say, I can ""feel"" it after I drink it. I'll most likely, buy, some, more. TL;DR I LIKE THE TASTE:"
"There's no comfort food better than Campbell's Green Pea soup yet it has become increasingly difficult to find on the supermarket shelves.  There's only one place in my city that carries it and they charge an outrageous $2.59 a can for it.  With free shipping with Amazon Prime, my cost was only $1.63 a can, a savings of almost $12 on the case.  It's hard to beat that. TL;DR Mmm, Mmm Good"
"I don't have anything startlingly new to say except to agree with all the praise and with the person who said you can make a 24 ounce mugful with it. I have a teapot about that size and enjoying my pot of this with a good book is a very satisfying experience. Sort of tea Barbara Pym might have liked. My late husband, also a fan, called it a ""three dimensional"" tea. I understand just what he meant and hope some of you will also. TL;DR More praise for Yorkshire Gold"
"I have consumed this as long as I can remember, eating the powder from the pouches too as kid. I don't believe any other hot chocolate product even comes close to the taste of this product. Now my kids love it as much as I do! TL;DR Since I Was a Kid"
"I like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill.  This is every bit as good as Deidrich and Tulley's but typically costs more.  I guess Wolkgang wants a cut.  If you catch it on sale, buy it. TL;DR Excellent Brew"
This tea is my favorite. Smooth taste. I'm not sure if it is because the tea is caffein free or just my imagination but seems to have a calming affect on me. I have shared my pound bag with friends and everyone loves the tea as well. I am ordering more today :) TL;DR No bitter after taste. My favorite tea by far!
"I love the Mio Sweet Tea best, the Mango Peach second, and the Peach third. I drink a lot of Crystal Light and diet drinks every day except for at work. The Crystal Light powder is hard to mix in the right quantity and diet drinks are heavy to carry in and expensive if I get them from the vending machine.<br /><br />This compact little bottle is perfect for bringing to work and mixing with our cold filtered water. It really packs a wallop! A small squirt and I get a hint of sweet flavor, a big squirt and there's amazing flavor.  I can't believe they can get this stuff that concentrated! TL;DR Tasty and easy!"
"I used some of this extract to make a chocolate bundt cake for company a few days ago; it was a huge hit. This is an item that is NOT very easy to find - none of my cooking supply catalogs had it!  I know when all else fails, check Amazon! TL;DR black walnut extract"
"This product is great. I add it to baked goods and oatmeal. Buying by the case is a great deal and I find I use it more frequently. TL;DR Great stuff, great price"
Thanks for the large container of arrowroot.  It is also a better price than I can<br />get at our local health food store. TL;DR good size
We received this product in great anticipation and we were greatly pleased in the wonderful texture and taste of the many loaves of bread we made!! TL;DR Great Product
"I am appalled that Kellogg's would discontinue this from the grocery stores, I don't get why.  It's been around for years and years!  While I haven't eaten it since I was a kid or anything, I have been buying it for several years now and was really disappointed when I couldn't find it in the stores anymore.<br /><br />This cereal is awesome, it tastes really good and the selling point for me is that it doesn't get soggy in milk!  Any other cereal I eat that has flakes is another story.  Not much else to say aside from that.<br /><br />I am very grateful to Amazon for carrying this in 4 box packs, I have been buying it from here and will continue to do so! TL;DR One of my all time favorite cereals!"
"I personally like the taste of this product, but I can see that others may not. The taste is unusual, with natural tones.<br /><br />I definitely like the packaging. Standard aluminum cans often start to look pretty bad from rubbing on each other for a long time, but a box of Zico survived a 2-week road trip that included some nasty dirt roads just fine. TL;DR Great for trips"
"Good stuff, dogs love it.  Made a big difference when I switched from another brand.  My dogs seem healthier, and have lost excess weight which they gained while on the other food.  Their bowel movements are more normal now, and they no longer have problems with their anal glands getting full/hard and needing to be emptied like they did with the other food.<br /><br />I was surprised to find negative reviews for this food.  I understand the one review about the dogs not being interested in the food, but please, people of amazon, don't write negative reviews for products because your local store sold you an expired bag.  1) that has nothing to do with amazon, and 2) that really has nothing to do with the product quality -- the manufacturer didn't sell it to you that way, it was probably just on the shelf for too long.  It's misleading to people looking for products when something has 2 stars because someone got an expired bag from A DIFFERENT STORE.<br /><br />My dogs love this food, and I don't think I'll ever switch.  Their health is important to me, and this food seems to deliver on that. TL;DR Good stuff."
"Gave this bone to my dog...the next day, he wouldn't eat or drink anything, was lethargic, vomiting. This continued for 3 days til we took him to the vet. $93 & an IV later, the vet says, yep, it was the Jumbone. It completely messed up his digestive system. No more dog treats for our dog! TL;DR Made my dog very, very sick..."
"These little pouches of gluten-free brownie mix are a wonderful product. I think it is more like two servings, rather than one. It is so nice to have a GF treat that can be whipped up in just a couple of minutes in the microwave but tastes like you spent an hour in the kitchen. A lot of GF products have an odd texture, this does not (the same goes for Pamela's regular bake-in-the-oven GF brownie mix -- yum!). I always try to have gluten-free cupcakes or cookies stocked in my freezer to send with my kids for a treat at a birthday party or event when their friends are going to be enjoying desserts that they can't have. But sometimes I get caught without something in the freezer and this makes an excellent alternative. I highly recommend these small-serving brownie packs! TL;DR Fantastic!"
"We've tried a lot of the other brands and flavors, and this is really the best we've found so far.  My gluten-eating husband loves it too. TL;DR Best GF Basic Bread Mix"
"delicious tea, a good deal. literally every silk packet has two tea leaves and a flower bud! TL;DR delicious"
"This product was recommened to us from a friend.  After doing some research I found out that it was one of the best ceral's out there and recommended by Dr. Sears.  After buying some at a local store and trying it my baby LOVVVED it!  I could not fee him fast enough! The pre & probiotics really help him not get ""backed"" up.  I also save so much with the subscribe and save.  Thanks amazon and thank you happy bellies!! TL;DR Babies Favorite"
"Whoever invented the modern-day brownie mix: God bless your sweet, sweet soul. I am completely and UTTERLY hooked on these. As a native San Franciscan, of course I support Ghirardelli but wow. These are fantastic brownies even without those feelings of being obligated to support your local peeps. Simply delicious, I won't try another brownie mix so long as I have these bad boys in my arsenal of pantry offerings. I love that I can get them delivered to my house in bulk through Amazon too! TL;DR YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMM-my."
"If you want a coffe that will curl your toenails, this ISN'T it!<br /><br />This is great-tasting coffee!  Not bitter, but smooth and mild.  A nutty flavor with faint undertones of chocolate and fruit.  No bad aftertaste.  Suitable for any time of day or night. TL;DR Wonderful; a real treat!"
This is the best matcha that I have tried so far.  It is lightly sweet and delicious.  Other brands just don't compare. TL;DR a great matcha
This is a lovely salt server - much larger than I expected.  Great for coarse sea salt like Maldon that can't be used in a shaker.  I'll probably buy another one so I can have one in the kitchen for cooking and another on the table. TL;DR Very nice salt holder
"yes they are more expensive, but my cats love them. They don't always like all the  flavors, but I think it is the best quality can cat food out there. BTW, I give them mostly dry, natural cat food, which cuts down the overall cost TL;DR Cats loved Fancy Feast"
"This is a perfect gift for any occasion- Christmas, Mother's or Father's Day, Birthday, Valentine's Day, or just to simply say ""here's something sweet for a sweet person that you are"". Must try and share this delicious, beautifully wrapped goodness. TL;DR Delicious!"
"Honeyville Farms blanched almond meal is an excellent product and has performed perfectly in every baked item that I have used it in. If you want to make muffins, without using wheat flour, this is the product for you! <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006ZN538"">Blanched Almond Meal Flour, 5 lb.</a> TL;DR Wonderful Product"
"At my dog's 8 year vet visit, they told me to start brushing her teeth.  The vet said that my dog might even need to have a professional teeth cleaning sometime in the next year or so.  I started trying out some new teeth chews because she really does not like getting her teeth brushed.  I thought that it would be unlikely that she would like these chews - but surprise, surprise!  She LOVES these chews (she prefers them over other chews) and the vet said to me last week at her 9 year check-up that her teeth looked really good.  She said, ""Do you brush her teeth?  They are in really good shape.""  Good teeth & my dog loves these treats!  What more could I ask for? TL;DR Really Improves Teeth!"
I'm so glad we got these. I packed them in my hospital bag and we set out the box for our guests at the hospital. Kids loved them and even our doctor wanted one. Makes a sweet keepsake box when you give them all away. TL;DR I'm so glad we got these
This drink is very good especially after a long hot workout. It quenches the thirst without all the added sugars and preservatives. I highly recommend. TL;DR Very good!
I only got to eat one little bite of my sample from Influenster because my son stole it and ate it!  Ha ha but the bite that I did have was amazing.  I will be getting more of these to keep in the house. TL;DR YUMMY!!!
The product was exactly as stated in the description.  It came on time and I'm very satisfied with the purchase.  It also came out much cheaper buying this product in bulk. TL;DR Irish Creme
"I have purchased the original glaze, blood orange, ginger, pomegranate and whatever others there are.  I used to make my own by putting balsamic in a pan and reducing it, sometimes flavored with something else.  The Roland glazes are so much easier and just squirt out of the bottle in a nice thin stream.  Great on Bruschetta, pork chops, or whenever you would garnish a dish with thickened reduced balsamic, without the work.  They also last longer and don't end up with crud in the bottom of the bottle after a few weeks, like regular reduced balsamic does. TL;DR All of the Roland balsamic glazes are terrific!"
I bought this coffee based on the reviews that I read. This is one of the weakest coffees that I had ever tasted. I had to use two pods to taste the hazelnut and vanilla essence. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. What a waste!!!! TL;DR Not Worth It
These are my mom's favorite gluten free cookies and ordering them from Amazon is the most economical way to purchase them. TL;DR Favorite Gluten Free Cookies
Very sub par for white peony.  The leaves are in tiny pieces and taste more like lipton tea than white peony I have had elsewhere.<br /><br />I won't buy this again.  Unfortunate because I like davidsons silver needle (which is significantly cheaper at soap . com ever since amazon upped the price a few months back) TL;DR pretty bad tea
Choking hazard.  Candy came off stick 3 times.  My son truly choked today. But he was able to cough it back up.  So scary.  I can't risk it anymore. Threw rest away. Called YE today with package info.  awaiting a call back from some higher up. TL;DR Some come off the sticks.
Not quite sure what to write about a review but who doesn't love candy? it was shipped as described and they tasted delicious! TL;DR really....?
"I remember the Shake n Bake commercials from when I was a kid, but I don't remember my mom ever using it. In fact, my mom fried pork chops so much when I was younger that I stopped eating them. I will cook them for my sons occasionally.<br /><br />Now I am no chef, never wanted to be. I am a quick and easy crockpot kinda girl. I always bake chops, not because baking is healthy but because it's lazy..I don't like standing over a stove thank you very much!<br /><br />What I like about the Shake N Bake is, it added a nice flavor to the chops and didn't dry them out. (my main problem when cooking pork chops..dryness) So it was a pleasant surprise to bite into one and not get the feeling I was eating a brick of sand.<br /><br />I'm also not a health nut, so I can't tell you about calories and the such, but I can tell you this. It's easy, simple and tasty. good enough for me. TL;DR Pretty up Your Pork Chops"
"I bought two of these from a Cracker Barrel store on my way back from the beach. $4 each. I'm a senior in highschool now so I can tell you it doesn't get old. My friends and I use them to shoot orange peel, apple, and potato pellets at our unfortunate classmates. I can tell u that Orange peels offer the best results. Pop the barrel and get three bits for long distance shotgun effect. The fin at the end of the gun is also great for rubber bands. 5 stars. TL;DR The Most fun I've ever had at this price."
"Not great, too much of this stuff is still way too readily available up to this day in 2011, so even though it's from the 80's, there still no real nostalgia. Perhaps doing other foods like doritos or Pepsi but with their OLD logos would have been much more fun... although that would probably be a lot more expensive. TL;DR Meh"
"I use Allspice in a lot of things.  Mostly in breakfast, as I have nuts and seeds.  I use cinnamon and Allspice for more flavor and it is good for me.  This is a great buy.  I also get cinnamon from Amazon. TL;DR Good stuff."
"I tend to love orange cranberry cookies, but this cookie recipe is not the best. It is excessively orange flavored, overwhelming the cranberry flavor. My guess is that they added too much orange flavor to the recipe. It also crunches, due to the second ingredient (puffed rice). I don't think the puffed rice crunch adds anything to the cookie. Furthermore, the cookie, although at a moderate level of sweetness, has a slight bitter aftertaste. It's not a bad cookie, but it's not particularly good either, and one I won't be buying again. IMO, it's not worth the 260 calories one gets from eating both halves.<br /><br />P.S. Only the first ingredient, the whole wheat flour is organic. TL;DR Okay, but not great"
"Years ago, there was a Japanese restaurant where I could get ice cold barley tea, occasionally.  They didn't always have it on the menu because of the brewing process taking so much time.  I loved that tea. When they had it on hand, I ordered two very large containers of it.<br /><br />Recently, I read about Barley tea bags, the House-Mugicha Barley Tea, in particular.  So, I found it and ordered it from Amazon,some for me and some for a friend of mine.<br /><br />The order was filled before the estimated time of delivery for both of us.  Well, she loves it and so do I.  Tastes just like that tea I liked in the Japanese restaurant only, I brew it anytime I like.<br /><br />It's so easy.  I just put one bag in a nearly two gallon jug, fill it with cold filtered water and place it in the fridge overnight.<br /><br />I plan to order more from Amazon too and so does my friend.  She is supposed to drink more water and the Barley tea helps her to do just that.<br /><br />Note: This kind of tea has many health benefits besides just tasting good.  The Japanese have been drinking it for centuries for good health.  And... it will cool down the body nicely during a hot Summer day. TL;DR It's healthy and it tastes good too!"
"I purchased this plant Jan 4 and it arrived like 5 days later.Its an amazing specimen it came nicely and securely packed,kudos to the seller! All intact except for a little dent on one of the leaves, tip was folded which did not really affect the health of the plant.I'm surprised it has like 3 growing plants in the 4""pot, so I have like 3 plants in one pot.I noticed it has roots in every segment,meaning its easy to propagate.For now it is happily hanging in my bathroom since its too cold to bring it out.I plan to plant one  outside on a trellis next to all my other orchids hoping it grows and mature into a huge plant.Then again I have 2 more that can happily stay potted.I got a really good deal for the price.Thanks Amazon &lt;3 TL;DR 17 "" variegated vanilla plant"
Ok the keurig is a trap because it makes such good coffee and the cups are so expensive.... Black tiger is very good as a dark strong coffee and the price is good if you sign up for monthly shipments... TL;DR Very good coffee
My husband's favorite biscuit (cookie) with tea. Plain but tasty. Hard to find in America. TL;DR McVities Digestive 400g 3 Pack
"I was skeptical at first with the previous reviews and this being the only variety Starbucks k-cups that's advertised on Amazon. But I received exactly as it was advertised. The shipping was a bit slow, but arrived as promised. Price is a little high compared to $34 for 54 k-cups (Starbucks Cafe Verona) in Costco, but if you want variety, you pay for it! Planning to order again in a couple of weeks. TL;DR Delivered as Promised.."
"Green peppercorns are best used whole (while cooking) or in a pepper grinder. They can be used in the same places you'd use black pepper, but are milder and more aromatic. They have less bite than black pepper.<br /><br />I was very pleased with these peppercorns.  I'd order them again. TL;DR Green is milder than Black, and both are great."
"These sardines remind me a lot of the Matiz product, but they may be a little saltier.  The difference is that the Matiz sardines in olive oil can be ordered in five-packs with free shipping (as of the time of this writing), and the Matiz product is every bit as good as this and a little easier on the salt. TL;DR Not bad, but you can do just as well for less money."
"I ordered this looking for a replacement to the expensive energy drinks that I have to buy from drugstores and gas stations. Call me naive but when I looked at the product page I assumed these would be 16 oz cans. They are 8.4 oz cans, which is not bad, but was not broadcast on the product page as I would expect. These tasted fine, kind of like what I remember red bull cola tasting like when I tried it back in the day. I would definitely buy again, but I am hoping for some type of free shipping offer because shipping really kills my savings when I buy these instead of national brand drinks at the gas station. TL;DR OK Product"
"This stuff is super hot! That's what my family wanted though. Unlike a lot of the other hot pepper powders, this one has a great flavor that is almost fruity and smoky. My family loves to put it on everything from ribs and noodles to even cantalope. (Hey, don't knock it thill you try it.) We would highly reccomend this powder to ""hot pepper"" officinados. TL;DR Hotter than Hades!"
I use these with my Torani coffee syrups at home.  I love them.  I can make my own coffee house drinks without paying the coffee house prices.  By using the pumps I don't spill or have syrup running down the bottle. TL;DR Do what they are supposed to!
"I'm a big fan of Syrian food, and decided to try this mix because it's not very easy (or cheap) to get all the ingredients to make my own falafel where I live. Well, I followed the instructions on the box (except for deep frying- I pan-fried mine and they turned out fine), and it's just about as good as my favourite Syrian restaurant!<br />The mix also makes an interesting batter for other fried/baked finger foods- less carbs, and slightly nutty- a healthy yet still tasty crunch. Will definitely be buying this more regularly :D TL;DR Great Mix!"
"This product is actually ""chocolate-flavored"" but it still tastes better than the melting wafers from the craft store. It's somewhat soft at room temperature and it melts fluidly. TL;DR just okay"
"The BBQ Chicken Mi Goreng flavor packs on the heat...and just right for those who like their food on the intense side. It has lots of packets of flavor including a spicy chili oil and soy sauce and some msg-powdered seasoning and hot chili powder and even dehydrated fried onions as garnish.<br /><br />It is subtly sweet and the spicy-heat just hits you in every bite and the flavors all merge into deliciousness. This is a flavor unlike any asian bistro cooking, and yet, it's so-oooooooooooo so, so good.<br /><br />I must admit that I have often wanted to find other flavors that were just as tasty and spicy and have only found 1 that is nearly as tasty but it's not a similar sweet-n-hot-savory, it's got heat but it's very different. (see my other ramen noodle review) TL;DR yummy, probably Indo mie mi Goreng's best flavor..."
"Funny, I was just eating these when I got the review-reminder email. I eat them with coconut milk and water with some stevia.  They are basically plain in taste, like you would imagine rice puffs to be, but slightly better for you because they are whole-grain.  I'm usually not completely satisfied to eat them alone, so I add a shake of organic rice chex to eat bowlful for a little extra flavor.  Otherwise, these things are a complete standby for me since I am allergic to so many grains. TL;DR What I wanted."
"It may not be saying much, but this is 10x better than the coffee we have at work.  I like that it's quick and convenient and has good strong flavor. TL;DR Good flavor, nice and quick"
"Green tea is your best weight-lose friend. Several years ago, I gained 15 pounds with no change to my diet except for an introduced intake of diet coke, about one per day. I stopped the diet coke and took up green tea. Although I started seeing marginal weight changes pretty soon, the great long-term benefit of green tea is that now I can pretty much eat anything, and I never have to worry about my weight as long as I drink a few cups of this tea everyday (not once in a while or twice a week. And ""eat anything"" is within reason - i.e. no eating 8 donuts in a row everyday.) I highly encourage making green tea drinking part of your morning, mid-day and afternoon routine. Swap it for coffee and even water. Drink decaf if you prefer to remove the caffeine effect. Do it for 30 days to get in a routine. I'm usually on the receiving end of ""how do you eat the way you do?"" I'm quoting this only to show that you will be a size with which you are comfortable without dedicating yourself to a life of steamed chicken breast and spinach or abysmally small serving sizes ""I'll just have a bite of the creme brule. No really, I can't have anymore - I already had fries for lunch."" This tea also regulates your hunger, so you're not craving snacks all day. The blueberry slim life tea has always been my favorite, and the boxes I got from Amazon were exactly what I expected. Plus, they were a great discount from the retailers that carry the tea - usually it's like $4.99 a box, and I got the set of 6 for less than $3. If you're a tea drinker, this is a great deal. I was a little afraid the boxes may be squished or mistaken, but they were intact. I'll definitely buy this again through Amazon. TL;DR Great tea!"
"When this item came up on sale and as a suggested item, I was not sure about purchasing a case without having tasted it. Since the description was about it being all<br />natural , but with carbonation, it made me think of the sparkling juice that is sold in a champagne bottle-shaped (usually during the holidays).<br /><br />Since I like that taste, I knew I'd like it, but I was a bit unsure of the flavors..<br />So I ordered the grape and cherry last time and this time I'm trying the punch flavor. I think the punch and grape had a bit stronger flavor than the cherry.<br /><br />Overall, I like the carbonated juice, and the fact that I'm not having a soda (those with phosphoric acid and other preservatives).<br />This would be a good drink for kids instead of soda, as it's all natural TL;DR Pure Juice  with carbonation"
"Great product - zero calories, zero unnatural sweeteners.  Much better for you than sugar, equal, etc ... and for only a few dollars, what do you have to lose?!<br /><br />I add 5 or 6 drops to your coffee and it's perfect (not too sweet, but not too bitter either).  Be warned though that adding too many drops is just overwhelming and makes your coffee taste awful. TL;DR sweet and healthy"
I have a Great Dane that is terified of storms.  I ordered these hoping that they would help her during this stressful time.  I could not beleive it!  I gave her one during a storm and she calm down enough for her to take a nap. She really liked the taste and they are good for her since they contain antioxidants.  The bag comes with 50 stixes which will last me a little while.  I will order more from Amazon again when I do run out. They are a very good value.  Thank you! TL;DR Beefeaters Anti Stress Stix!
"I just received my order for both Israeli couscous and for French Lentils from Barry Farms.  Neither included directions for cooking.  As a result, I am having to do additional work to know how to process the products.  Not something that I want to do, quite frankly. TL;DR No Directions for Cooking Included"
"a gasp from my past. i can't believe these are still being made. now, i am getting a box every six months. YES!!!! i loved the root beer ones when i was a kid. TL;DR I Hit the motherload"
These Bakery on the Main bars are an easy take with you treat!  The kids love them and so do we. TL;DR Nice Treat
"At $9.68 for a two-pound bag, including super saver shipping, the price is certainly right.  I purchased this about two weeks ago for $2 more.  There is a reason why this is on sale.  I've noticed in buying Amazon's flavored coffees that are on sale, that either there is no flavor/aroma or it's overpowering.  In this case, it's the latter.  The hazelnut flavor is, at least for my taste, way too much.  What I did is mix these beans with plain beans on a 50/50 basis.  There is still plenty of hazelnut flavor and aroma anyway.  I notice no acidity with this coffee, which can be a problem for me because I drink about five cups every morning. TL;DR Can't beat the price, but ..."
"Great standing prime rib. meat was well pakaged and fresh. Meat was delivered early. Prime rib was so juicy...followed this recipe from paula deen, yummy...[....] Thanks so much TL;DR great standing prime rib"
"I got this sample from influenster and I loved it. It was soft, not too sweet and the texture and taste were perfect. TL;DR so delicious"
"First package was dropped off in the rain and got soaked through. The company promptly resent another.<br />This is so much cheaper than buying it in the supermarket. I love the flavor and for me it tastes really good on Ribeye steak with a pinch of salt on each side before using the seasoning.<br />I also use it on chicken, it's mild but very tasty. TL;DR Love this spice!"
"I found this coffee bean, freshly coarse-ground in a burr grinder and carefully prepared in a French press, to be devoid of aroma and very bitter, even with sugar (which I ordinarily do not add) added. Wish it could be returned for a refund of its unreasonable cost, but it cannot be. TL;DR Very disappointed!"
"I tried this product because it was a ""Friday Special"" and it caught my eye it being 100% fruit and 100% organic.  I don't have any children, but this looked interesting to try because I've been trying to eat healthier and sometimes it's hard to get my recommended amount of fruit servings a day.  I buy fruit but it always seems to go bad before I can eat it all.  I bought the peach mish mash also, and really like it, too.  I like to add it to my oatmeal, or spread it on top of my peanut butter toast, or just by itself!  To clarify the ingredients- it has 3 different fruits, not just peach and not just banana.  Obviously, I'm ok with this...just wanted to throw that out there.  There are multiple things I love about this product.  Here goes.. and not in any particular order...<br />1) Easy to open, convenient, resealable pouch<br />2) It tastes great!<br />3) All natural, 100% fruit...no nasty preservatives or chemicals<br />4) 100% organic<br />5) Great for everyone, not just babies.<br />6) The price is good compared with other similar products, and I love the free shipping! TL;DR Great for adults, too!"
These bars are THE BEST! They are my go-to bar whether it be for a quick breakfast or a guilt free snack. Tasty and filling and the extra protein is a bonus. Try them but be forwarned.......they become a craving quickly. TL;DR Delicious and multi-purpose!
"These are tasty in a serious junk food kind of way, but that is not a surprise since this is candy melted onto corn chips :)<br /><br />You eat these when you are craving salt and sugar and can't be bothered to pour a bag of M&Ms into a bowl of salted popcorn.  They are seriously the perfect PMS cliche food.<br /><br />Make sure you put the amount you WANT to eat in a bowl or cup and then put the rest back in the pantry or else you will be left with and empty bag and a stomach ache ;)<br /><br />FYI: I found these at the dollar store for a buck each. TL;DR These taste like someone melted some peanut butter cups into a bag of Bugles"
"When I was around 8 years old my family took me and my younger brother on our first trip to Cape Cod Massachusetts, since then we went up once every summer for a week or so, those first few years we would take a pop up camper to a camp site by the beach. The campsite itself had two memorable things, the first was a play ground my brother and I would spend time at, and the second was a small candy shop down by the end of the road leading up to the camp site, it was in this candy store that I had my first box of Nerds.<br /><br />My brother and I looked all over the candy store with the wide eyed wonder of the literal kid in a candy shop. The one thing that caught my eye was the small pink and purple box of candy up by the register. Since our mother only let us buy one thing each this is what I chose, and my brother (always copying me) chose the same, which we enjoyed on our way back to the camper. Of all the tastes on that trip, the marshmellows we toasted over the campfire, the seafood we had in the local resturants, my first bite of buttered lobster, the wind and saltwater on the beach, it was that little box of candy that my brother and I shared on the way back to the camper that stands out to me the most.<br /><br />Many years later in high school I met one of my best friends working at thelocal FYE, his name was Andrew and we first started talking over one of the jumbo boxes of Nerds, striking up a conversation about how you got almost a pound of candy with the box of Nerds, and how other candy boxes skimped out and filled it with mostly empty space. For most of my high school years he and I would hang out at the store, exchange stories, shoot the breeze, ect, usualy over a box of Nerds.<br /><br />Ive now been out of high school for almost four years, Andrew and I have lost touch over the past few years, and my brother died almost 7 years ago. After all this time these tint little candies still bring back all th happy memories from my childhood and teen years. Bravo Wonka on this exellent product. TL;DR A Box of Memories"
"This was the perfect size and gift for a go-away.  Although the plate is permanently mounted, ""Thank You"" we were able to put a ""Happy Travels"" card in front of it. TL;DR Great go-away present"
"Love my Cream of Rice.  Now that colder weather is here, it's time for a nice warm breakfast.  Unfortunately all the local grocers in the area no longer carry it. Thank you Amazon, you have saved me again.  From my favorite tea and now for the best hot cereal there is. Ordering a case may seem a bit much, but I have alot of family members who will help me gobble it up. TL;DR Finally Cream of Rice"
"I love the stash tea company. Their products are nice quality for an American tea company(their leaves are still broken up and stuffed in a bag,but it's hard to find a YUMMY loose leaf chai.  This company may still sell loose teas but the chai is not as flavorful as in the bag. If you like your chai tea to have a little more flavor this is the chai to buy. I serve it with milk, cream or egg nog. Sometimes I double the bag to get more flavor. TL;DR Ahh! the smell is delightful"
"This is the worst thing I have ever tasted in my life!  The bars smell and taste like fish, despite the box assuring us there is no fish oil in it. I agree with the reviewer who could not even finish the bar.  I am going to ask the company for my money back. TL;DR Absolutely horrible!"
"La Cima  hearts of palm are the best!  They are cooked to perfection... not mushy, but<br />not too stringy.  I hear that they start with good organic hearts of palm grown in Puerto Rico.  My grocery used to carry them, but then they stopped because they said the deliveries were not reliable and they could not get them any more.  THey are hideously expensive, especially the whole hearts of palm, but they are absolutely the<br />best tasting Hearts of palm on the market. TL;DR La Cima for everyone!  Why can't all people who sell hearts of palm make them as good as La Cima?"
"This was really good chocolate.  I didnt receive what I ordered though.<br />Instead, I received the ""new"" chocolate.  Quite a disappointment.  Still the chocolate is good, its just not the tried and true chocolate that I remember.  And for that price....I could have bought it at a local store. TL;DR Great chocolate"
"The blocks are going to be great favors for my wedding- My fiance is a HUGE lego fan, and we got them for him.They are a little hard to stack, and then they can NOT unstack- but they are candy so, what do you expect? The flavor is ok, they are a little chalky tasting.. TL;DR ok, but not the best"
I love several versions of the endangered species chocolate.  The panther is very dark and not terribly sweet which I prefer.  I order on a regular basis. TL;DR Great Dark Chocolate
"On the plus side, the tea mixed fairly easily without any residue remaining on the bottom - stirring with a spoon in a glass is adequate. That was important to me since convenience and ease in making it are part of what makes me want to buy it. I thought it was very sweet and refreshing, and my husband enjoyed it.<br /><br />On the negative side, it was almost too sweet for me, but if you add more water (obviously) that helped. What I couldn't change was the taste itself, and I thought there was a bit of an ""aftertaste"".  I don't know whether or not it's just because I just don't like the taste of the acai, which I've never had before.  I think I would have preferred just the strawberry. But if you are a fan of acai I would say you should try this and it may end up being ""your cuppa tea"". TL;DR the good and the bad"
I love the ease of buying these online as opposed to going out of my way to the closest Central Market or Whole Foods. Love that I have such an easy and tasty option to the aluminum can tomatoes. TL;DR Love These!
"I was happy with this shipment of Nut Thins, but I notice the prices have increased on future orders.  This is a most likely Blue Diamond increase, not anything Amazon can regulate.  I will not be able to afford the new prices. TL;DR Nut Thins price"
"I've tried many pizza sauces, but keep coming back to Contadina Pizza Squeeze, not only for the taste, but for the convenience of the squeeze bottle, since I make individual-size pizzas.  When my local supermarkets stopped carrying this, and I couldn't find an alternate that I liked as well, I stopped making my own pizza.  I'm delighted to find an online source that doesn't charge a fortune for shipping; thanks soap.com!<br /><br />If Contadina would make this in a glass jar with screw off lid (like Classico does with their pasta sauces), I would get that, but so far,I have not seen it made that way<br /><br /> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007EC5AMA"">Contadina Pizza Squeeze Pizza Sauce, 15 oz, 3 pk</a> TL;DR My favorite sauce for homemade pizza!"
"I cannot review the product, since I never got a chance to open it. Just as others complained, I too ordered a 32oz bottle but received a 4oz bottle, labeled on the packaging as 32oz. I contacted Amazon, who fulfilled the order, and I sent it back almost two weeks ago and am still awaiting reimbursment. TL;DR I got a 4oz bottle too...???"
"Cause this stuff has it, Lea & Perrins doesn't!<br /><br />But thats not why I'm rating this so low. It gets two stars because its terrible,<br />a thin watery pitiful substitute for L&P that does no justice to any dish, and<br />especially not to a Bloody Mary.<br /><br />Heinz is a pretty good brand name, I have never understood why they cant get this<br />right. Check it yourself, pull a bottle from the shelf, turn it upside down and see<br />how quickly it runs down the sides leaving nothing behind. I suppose if you cooked<br />this down to about a 60% solution it would be ready to use, but right out of the<br />bottle its a pretty weak substitute for real Worcestershire sauce. I did have a<br />bottle of this that I fortified with a Tsp of anchovy paste and it tasted much better. TL;DR Where are all the high fructose monkeys?"
"I love keeping fruit in my office for lunch or snacks, and applesauce cups are a perfect solution.  Unfortunately, I'm not really a fan of apples, and most applesauces are bland or unpleasant tasting.  Mott's Blueberry Delight Healthy Harvest, on the other hand, is extremely tasty, contains no sugar or artifical sweeteners, and is only 50 calories.  It's probably the best tasting applesauce I've ever had. TL;DR Very tasty for applesauce."
"For unknown reasons, this item disappeared from every local store shelf a couple years ago.  I found another brand here on Amazon and liked it, but nothing tastes as good to me as the Kraft version.  So now I'm thrilled to see it's finally on Amazon!  And at less than $2 per cannister when it was nearly $5 the last time I saw it in my grocery store?  WOW!  Thank you, Amazon! TL;DR My Favorite Grated Romano!"
"YUCK! I would have only left one word for the review---YUCK! But, Amazon requires at least 20 words. Occasionally I indulge in childhood comfort food like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese; however this Kraft Easy Mac tastes bad to me. TL;DR Just One Word Too."
This beef jerky tastes GREAT! I love it. Use it for quick on the go snacks for me and my kids. Amazon's price is great as well. This is my favorite of the flavors. TL;DR Yummy!
"We have used this product for about 30 years now. Our local store no longer carries it so it was great when we found it here, Thank you so much  Great stuff TL;DR Adolph Seasoning Mix Beef Stew"
"All I can say about this wonderful tea is that it is an excellent blend of red, white and green and it's organic, too.  There's really no way to describe in words exactly what the tea tastes like, but imagine a light green tea with top notes of peony and a slight hint of minty earthiness and sweetness to the bottom note.  Hot, this tea is calming, yet vibrant in taste.  Cold, the mintier side of the tea comes out and is very refeshing.<br /><br />I am GLAD I got so much of this, because I drink several cups a day.  I reuse each tea bag once or twice.  Note that these tea bags DO NOT have little strings on them.<br /><br />A definite enjoyment for any tea lover and I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something new and exciting in their tea. TL;DR Great Tea for the Money!"
"While I thought the concept of Tuna Jerky sounded like a good idea, in reality these fell short.  The tuna was extremely hard and dry; all moisture was lost in the curing process and left the tuna tasting more like hard paper.  I enjoy the Salmon Jerky, but I will not be ordering the tuna again.  From the brittle hard texture to the strange after taste, this tuna was disappointing. TL;DR Dry and hard"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GWHATY"">Coffee Bean Direct Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean Coffee, 5-Pound Bag</a><br /><br />I have researched the different coffee blends available and chose this one and I like to grind the beans just before I make coffee or grind some for the week, delicious.  Everyone has their own idea of great coffee, this is the one I chose.  I invite anyone wanting to try the gourmet coffee to read all about the different countries coffee beans and determine what is best for you.  By small quantity first and if it's the one, treat yourself to a larger amount.  I suggest the bean, so you will want a good electric grinder.<br /><br />What is really great is  my family buys with confidence from Amazon.  Just about everything we need we purchase from or through Amazon, with the certainty we will be pleased with what we purchase.  Johnnie TL;DR I Truly Enjoy The Ethiopian Coffee!"
This must be a taste thing reading some of the other reviews.  This is the 1st salsa with 7 peppers that you can taste each variety with a nice long burn but not too hot.  I loved it!  Now I have to buy it on line since not a single chain store has it in Northern Virginia! TL;DR You Can Taste Each Pepper!
"These are a little piece of heaven! I think it's white chocolate with pumpkin flavoring? Also a hint of nutmeg maybe? Either way, they are simply divine. TL;DR Delish!"
"I'll admit, I had a difficult time reviewing this. The Celsius bottle boasts not only that it is a great energy/workout drink, but that it boosts your metabolism to the point where you will be able to burn about 100 calories per can. The only downside to that claim? The average person is completely unable to validate this claim. I know I'm not- I can only say what I personally felt while I was drinking it.<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />Eh... it's ok. It isn't the best energy drink flavor I've ever had, but it isn't the worst by any stretch. The flavor I had was raspberry acai green tea. While raspberry isn't one of my favorite flavors, I do love the taste of acai. Unfortunately this is a tart drink, so if you don't like sour-ish things then you probably won't like this. I know that the first time I tasted this I wasn't that enamored of the flavor. Over time it grew on me, though.<br /><br />Weight loss claims:<br /><br />I can't verify this as far as the calorie burning goes. So forget the calorie & metabolism claims. Obviously most people won't drink this expecting it to cause them to lose weight without effort, but since I can't prove that any calories burnt would be because of this drink (& not because of diet or exercise) I'm not going to believe the claims.<br /><br />Energy:<br /><br />Energy wise though, this drink is a winner. I've drank quite a few cans of this & its given me a great supply of energy. I drank a can yesterday because I was going to be pulling a VERY late day (up for close to 24 hours) & I felt fantastic 10-20 minutes after I'd finished the drink. I've had NO jitters or heart flutters from this at all, which is a biggie for me when it comes to energy drinks. If it causes me to be jittery or have any sort of abnormal heart stuff, I won't drink it on principle. (Seriously, why would I want to continue drinking something that made me feel like that?)<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent product if you are looking at it from an energy drink perspective. It only has 10 calories for the entire can, plus it has a nice load of vitamins thrown into it. The only warning I'd give a perspective drinker (other than to not put a lot of weight on the metabolism claims) is that you should eat something before drinking this. Normally I don't get an upset tum from drinking energy drinks on an empty stomach, but this one gave me a bit of an upset stomach until I ate something to settle it.<br /><br />As long as you are looking at this from an energy drink perspective, you should be fine & be happy with the product. I don't know that I'll be buying this in bulk like I do some of my favorite tea drinks or my chocolate soy milk, but it is something that I plan on purchasing every once in a while in single cans. TL;DR Forget about the calorie burning claims..."
"I usually order vanilla beans to make my own vanilla extract for myself and others. I thought I'd try this paste and I'm glad I did. First of all, I can use it right away instead of having to wait 3 weeks for the extract to mature. Second, I like the fact that although I don't have to mess around with the beans when making ice cream, I still get the black specks in anything I make.<br />The flavor is good. TL;DR Great Stuff"
I recently tried this canned vegetable and found it most authentic. It tastes just like the sauce that was served in the company cafeteria each day for lunch during my 2006 visit to the southwest of India. TL;DR Heat and eat authentic taste
"How can something wrapped in plastic taste so good? Man, this is what Kinder Bueno is. I devour these in about two bites they are so good. This is from the same company that is responsible for my addiction to Nutella. If ever you see these in a store and have a craving for some chocolate, do not hesitate and eat them all. TL;DR Surprise, Surprise"
"These funny little coffee pods for your Keurig will give K-Cups a real run for the money!  Great price and high quality coffee, and they work perfectly in the brewer.  I've tried Fog Chaser, Rainforest Blend, and French Roast.  If you like bold darker roasts then you'll be pleased with these, so don't be afraid to try them.  I f you like a lighter cup these may not be for you.  I have not tried Breakfast Blend.  I will continue buying, very happy with this product! TL;DR Great Product"
"I always worry about spices or produce being bought online may not be fresh, but this exceeded my expectations.  Very fresh produce.  I was surprised at the amount of chiles I received.  Fast delivery too. TL;DR Very Fresh Produce!"
The product seemed old and hard. The only way we are eating it is to microwaving it for a bit. TL;DR Sweet tarts
This was just what we needed for our float in the 24th of July parade to go with our fishing theme.  The kids loved it! TL;DR just what we needed!
"Yes, it's true:  I've never been so impressed with a consumer gadget in my life.  In fact, it changed my life, awakening an interest in urban gardening.  Having proceeded to get up to my chin in hydroponics, I bought 5000 shares in Aerogrow (pretty cheap at its current price).<br /><br />I received my first Aerogarden (I have two) as a gift.  The first thing I grew was lettuce.  You don't know what you're missing until you've yanked fresh leaves off of living lettuce right on your kitchen counter to put in your sandwich!  So simple, so fresh (no refrigeration!).  Anyone who buys lettuce regularly should consider replacing that habit with this, the 7-pod Aerogarden.<br /><br />The complaints that interest me the most are those regarding the cost of seed kits, the failure of supplied seeds to germinate, or the failure of plants to grow adequately.  Currently I have one Aerogarden going.  The only Aerogarden-supplied plant in there is a cherry tomato.  The others I supplied myself: three pods are growing miniature Mexican sour gherkins (a sort of miniature cucumber) and another is growing purple tomatillos.  The remaining two pods I am using for experiments.  I asked myself, could I germinate fruit trees in my Aerogarden?  The answer is yes.  An apple seed (simply from a grocery store apple) is now a four-inch ""tree"", and an orange seed is just starting to get going.  I have also grown small varieties of eggplant and sweet peppers to (delicious!) maturity.  So, I recommend that you acquire your own seeds rather than rely on the Aerogarden seed kits.  (Do consider whether a given plant will fit the dimensions of the Aerogarden.  I started an okra plant in it and it did too well, too fast--for one thing, I didn't know that okra leaves are gigantic!)  In fact, I think the company should give up on the seed kits and just concentrate on selling the basic things you need to plant your own seeds (like the sponges).  They do already offer these items, by the way.<br /><br />The Aerogarden is not a Ronco-like novelty item.  It is simply hydroponics made simple.  There is currently, to my knowledge, no other all-in-one hydroponics setup available.  The closest competitor was the Prepara Power Plant, now no longer manufactured.<br /><br />If you were to put together a similar set-up yourself (which you can do, as the construction is easy to understand), you would find that your $100 would not buy much more than a proper lighting fixture and light bulbs.  Incidentally, the light has a marvelous daylight quality which I find brightens the mood of the room.  This might be a consideration for you if you live far north (esp. in Seattle, I would think!).<br /><br />I haven't noticed any reviews that mention placing an Aerogarden in an office.  While the 3-pod and 6-pod models might be slightly too noise for that setting (they operate on a different principle), the 7-pod model is whisper quiet and would, I think, be just as welcome in an office or lobby as an aquarium. TL;DR Liked it so much I bought stock in the company"
Hands down the best cereal!! I ate this growing up as a kid then never saw it until now. I wish it was around all year but glad I got some now! TL;DR WOW!
"I had them in hot chocolate and they were tasty. I must admit that I don't really remember what marshmallows taste like since it's been years since I've had them, so I can't vouch for their authenticity, but I enjoyed them that's for sure. I can't wait to try them for smores. TL;DR pretty good"
"I am NOT a tea expert or a tea connoiseur, but this product gave me what I was looking for: a huge quantity of nice-tasting white tea for a shockingly low price (at least compared with the prices of other white teas). That's why I gave it 5 stars. If you're looking for the highest-quality white tea, which sells for many times the cost per ounce of this particular tea, you're not going to find it here-- but how could you expect to?  To my relatively unrefined palate it tastes pretty good. It's milder and more pleasant than the various green teas that I've bought, as white tea is supposed to be. This bag contains a lot of long stems and longish leaves, which the best quality white tea almost certainly won't have, but it hasn't detracted from my enjoyment of product. I drink 5 cups a day, and this product lets me do that for a reasonable price.  So if you're considering a purchase, at least you'll be forewarned as to what's inside.  If you're simply looking for a large quantity of very inexpensive, pleasant, loose-leaf white tea that's supposedly quite rich in polyphenol antioxidants, this is a good choice. TL;DR Great value"
"I LOVED Honey Milk Light.  They didn't have the Core Power 20mg protein available for a while, so I ordered the 26mg Core Power while they were in tranistion--anxiously awaiting the Core Power 20mg (supposed to be 'same as' Honey Milk).  I read the BEWARE review regarding the Core Power 20mg, but thought I would try it anyway.  MISTAKE.  I can actually TASTE the sugar alcohol.  Not good.  Tastes terrible and not good for your body.  They really did totally screw up the formula when they changed from Honey Milk to Core Power.  If I could give the rating a ZERO, I would too. TL;DR AGREE w/ BEWARE!!!"
"I buy both the chocolate and the regular PB2. This stuff is great and very versatile. I have cooked with it, made banana sandwiches with it, and mixed it with yogurt. Not only is it low calorie, but it tastes great!<br />I started Weight Watchers in February and needed a peanut butter alternative. This is it! 2 tablespoons equals out to 1 point in the points plus calculator.<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone. TL;DR OMG!!! Weight Watchers friendly!!"
"Johnny's Great Caesar is a staple in my kitchen.  Love this product.  Makes my food come alive, and so tasty.<br />I would be lost without it. TL;DR Love this product"
"This Premium Gunpowder Green by Uncle Lee's has GOT to be the richest tasting out there, with a most fascinating flavor unknown to any other type of Green tea! Its naturally sweet taste with plenty of Vit. C, catechins, amino acids and minerals makes it one of the healthiest teas on the market! We drink this particular brand of Green daily to our good health! DO try it and see for yourself why we would rather fight than switch! TL;DR Best Green Tea on the market!"
"This cider isn't too bad, but it doesn't really have enough spices in it for my tastes.  I think next time I may put a cinnamon stick in the cup before brewing to see if that helps any. TL;DR Not bad..."
"Whats better then a Toblerone bar? How about a huge,14.1 ounce Toberone bar! Please Sir,I want some more.<br /><br />Creamy chocolate,crunchy almonds and chewy nougat. Sounds too good to be true,no? Its true and in gigantic form with these Toberone bars.<br /><br />Give them as gifts too. They make the perfect gift for the person who has everything all the way to your coworker who just broke up with her boyfriend. TL;DR Huge Hunk of Goodness"
"I sprinkle a little of this on my dogs kibble or use as treats while training, and she loves it. Nikita, 60# Husky Shepherd mix. TL;DR She loves it!"
"This decaf is OK.  It is a Medium Roast, not a dark roast (says it on the can, but not in the description here).  Also, unlike another reviewer, I think that it is ground very fine. TL;DR Decent"
worst ready to eat indian food I ever got...it's packaged as Hyderabad Biryani..wish these guys know what a Hyderabad Biryani is all about..<br /><br />plain bad taste and waste of money..I have opened 1 packet..tried and put it in trash..trying to return remaining five if shipping works out for me. TL;DR worst ready to eat indian food I ever got
"This coffee makes a complex flavorful cup of coffee. Low acid (smooth) and we used a drip coffee maker, but this would be good for expresso makers as it's a fine grind. I gave it a 5 star rating as I have never had a coffee quite like this one. Interesting & enjoyable & glad we decided to add it to our order. We have tried around 20 various coffees recently and this was one that didn't disappoint us. TL;DR Unique Extra Fine Ground Coffee"
"I like health food but salty snacks are my downfall, I'm so glad to have found these, they take care of my craving for chips and they dont taste like diet food! TL;DR very very good!"
"I have not drank the milk directly, but based on the reviews I purchased this brand as a homemade bread ingredient.  Works great and when in the bowl it looks like milk, not a bluish watered down powdered product.  Great price, and a great product! TL;DR Great for Baking Bread"
"And they are ONLY as good as the season you're trying to use them in. If you do your research about the feeding habits of wasps/hornets and stinging things, you will see that they are attracted to sugary things early in the year, and you should set this kind of trap out early. Like before you even SEE the first flying terror early. Before you're thinking about ""I need to get rid of these things"" you must be getting rid of them! If you wait until May, you're WAY too late in most places. You really need to catch queens to reduce local populations and that happens as soon as the ground starts to warm. Think NOW (I'm in VA. It's February). As the year progresses, they like protein to prepare for over-wintering. It's also the same time they tend to get more aggressive. So you put some tuna or raw meat in small quantities in your traps instead. I also get a TON of bees and wasps around my pool which is also salt water and a great spot for thirsty bugs of all kinds it seems- never mind that I border a forested preserve. What doesn't nest in my yard has free rein right behind my pool! I use a combination of traps on my fence line and those cheesy looking fake wasp nests that you can hang from soffits (wasps are territorial and avoid other wasp's nests). My traps are going out this week, it's been unseasonably warm. The ground is warm and once I even consider putting veggie seeds in the garden, it's time for bee/wasp/hornet control too. The fake nest things go out a little later in the spring. It's a combination that has worked well. Yes, Flies and misc flying things are also attracted. It's sugar in most traps. What do you expect?<br /><br />Something else to consider... there are many kinds of bees and hornets. Some look very much alike. Honey bees and yellow jackets, esp when the bees are small can look very much alike. We NEED honey bees. You really don't want to get rid of your good bees and you can encourage what you like, and discourage what you don't. Poisoning the good things just leaves more space for the bad things to eat and breed. Before I kill anything I'm sure I've got a hornet, and having some wasps around isn't a bad thing either. They predate nuisance flies and other things I also don't want around. If you kill all the wasps, before you know it you're overloaded with flies! So the enemy of my enemy is indeed my friend. If I was deathly allergic I'm sure I'd feel differently, but if you're not give a thought to what you're doing and when. TL;DR I've used these and every other kind..."
"I'd stick with the real thing if you possibly can.  This has a little bit of a bitter taste after you use it.<br /><br />Real soy sauce is much better, but if you have to go gluten free and love sushi this is a good second option. TL;DR OK if you have to be gluten free"
"Culture fires right up and makes good bread. Instructions clear and precise. Be sure to check out breadtopia's website for nice, slow-paced videos that are Very helpful. TL;DR Works Good"
"First off I think the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044CPA28"">Crunchy Nut Golden Honey Nut, 14.1-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> taste better than this version, but I had to try it.<br /><br />Also, the cereal stays crunch for a bit in milk, but that is because it seems like a big bit of honey coated batter. Not much nutty crunch, more like a cracker crunch to it.<br /><br />Ingredients: Yellow corn meal, sugar, corn bran, peanuts, honey, molasses, salt, whole oat flour, caramel color, baking soda, annatto extract color, ascorbic acid (vitamin C),niacinamide, reduced iron, zinc oxide, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Thiamin Hydrochloride (Vitamine B1), vitamine A, Palmitate, BHT (preservative), Folic acid, Vitamin D, Wheat starch, Vitamin B12.<br /><br />Well? Ehh. Some of the cheapest ingredients (i.e. corn) so don't expect much here. Just surprised that with the heal conscious movement that a more healthy option isn't being made here.<br /><br />It's a nice crunchy snack you could eat straight form the box without milk, like fiddle-faddle or something.<br /><br />I ate a two servings an hour before a bike ride. Went out for a ride and 30minutes into ride I had no energy left. I wasn't surprised as this is just an empty sugary cereal.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't buy it again, but it isn't a bad cereal don't get me wrong. Just wasn't spectacular and doesn't give me a reason to leave my honey-nut cherrios (seeing a pattern here in the ingredients?)<br /><br />For those that need a little something to snack on vs. making this a meal it could be a good option. TL;DR another sweet, non-nutrious cereal to add to the list"
"Fuzzy Wuzzy's Summary:<br />**** Recommended with warm fuzzies.<br /><br />I just received my single 2.25-ounce bar this morning and it was a good thing that I already ate breakfast as I nibbled (instead of chomped) on this with my morning coffee.  I have always liked all of Newman's line of foods, because they taste good and are made of high-quality ingredients, and because his foundation donates hundreds of millions of dollars to charities throughout the world.  (And I love his movies! :-)  Paul Newman walked the philanthropic walk in helping to make the world a better place.<br /><br />This 54% cocoa dark chocolate bar has an all-organic ingredient list that is free of artificial sweetener and extraneous additives and fillers, which is all too common in chocolates, candies, and foods these days.<br /><br />Note that, at the time of this review's writing, the ""Ingredients"" and ""Nutrition Facts"" listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate bar are actually copied from another ""Newman's"" chocolate bar, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYQQC"">Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> , and so this information that is currently listed on Amazon's site for this dark chocolate does NOT apply to this product; it refers to Newman's Milk Chocolate.  Hopefully, Amazon will correct the listings in these two sections for this product.<br /><br />Amazon's ""Ingredients"" listing: Organic Milk Chocolate (Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Organic Cocoa Butter, Organic Whole Milk Powder, Organic Chocolate Liquor, Organic Soy Lecithin [An Emulsifier], Organic Vanilla), Natural Coffee Flavor.<br /><br />Actual Wrapper's ""Ingredients"" listing: Organic Dark Chocolate (Organic evaporated cane juice, organic chocolate liquor, organic cocoa butter, organic soy lecithin [an emulsifier], organic vanilla).<br /><br />Wrapper's ""Nutrition Facts"" listing (with Amazon's corresponding ""Nutrition Facts"" listing, that actually apply to Newman's Milk Chocolate bar, in parentheses):<br /><br />Calories:  330 (340)<br />Calories from Fat: 200 (190)<br />Total Fat:  22g 34%DV (23g 35%DV)<br />Saturated Fat:  13g 65%DV (12g 60%DV)<br />Monounsaturated and Trans Fat: 0g (0g)<br />Cholesterol:  0g 0%DV (5mg 2%DV)<br />Sodium:  5mg (30mg)<br />Total Carbohydrate: 37g 12%DV (37g 12%DV)<br />Fiber:  4g 16%DV (1g 4%DV)<br />Sugars:  28g (33g)<br />Protein:  3g (3g)<br />Vitamin A:  0% (2%)<br />Vitamin C:  0% (2%)<br />Calcium:  2% (20%)<br />Iron:  10% (15%)<br /><br />So Newman's Own Organics Milk Chocolate Bar has more vitamins, calcium, and iron due to its use of milk, while the dark chocolate has more fiber and less sodium.  Many people do not consider chocolate to be a high-fiber food, but dark chocolate (not milk chocolate) ranks among the top-20 for high-fiber foods.  Dark chocolate is loaded with flavonoids that act as antioxidants, keeping your heart healthy and reducing oxidative stress.  Flavonoids also balance hormones in your body, and they activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase levels in your body (biochemical gibberish that translates to ""helps regulate your blood pressure"" :-)  Studies have also shown that dark chocolate, perhaps due to its increased fiber content, makes you feel more ""filled up"", giving you more of a feeling of satiety compared with eating milk chocolate.<br /><br />At the time of this review's writing, Amazon had not yet priced this chocolate. But even if it was priced higher than other dark chocolates offered by the larger candy factories, I would still buy this because I believe in Newman's cause and charities.  I also love dark chocolate that is combined with nuts and/or berries, such as the Chocolove dark chocolates, and I hope that the ""Newman's"" dark chocolates line also eventually includes those.<br /><br />I love dark chocolates with cocoa content that goes to 77% and beyond, but these are not as sweet and have a subtle bitterness compared to dark chocolates with lower cocoa content.  The 54% cocoa content of this Newman's bar strikes a happy balance of sweetness that will appeal to those who are more accustomed to milk chocolate's sweetness.  This chocolate is not as sweet as some of the other 54-55% cocoa dark chocolates out there because many dark chocolates add higher amounts of extra sugar to their bars.  The flavor of this chocolate is nice, but with a slightly fibrous texture; just don't expect it to be as sweet as some of the more-sweetened dark chocolates on the market or else you may think that this tastes a bit bland compared to them.  Likewise, some people think that heavily-salted food tastes better than lightly-salted food.  The ""evaporated cane juice"" used as a sweetener in this chocolate is a healthier alternative than the processed sugar that is included in many chocolate bars (including the Belgium-made Chocolove bars that I love).  Both refined sugar and cane juice come from sugar cane, but cane juice is less processed and retains more nutrients.  So enjoy this smooth rich dark chocolate ""health food"" guilt-free, but in moderation.  I certainly will enjoy eating the rest of this chocolate bar while watching my DVD of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019UGYK0"">Cool Hand Luke (Deluxe Edition)</a> TL;DR Yummy smooth dark chocolate that is also good for your health!"
"What!!!!!!!! $6.38 + $8.70 shipping, for a box that weight only 10 onz, no, no, no.<br />Other place in internet has the same probuct for $3.??, an less in shipping TL;DR TOOOOOOOOOOOOO expensive!!!!!!!!"
"These are the best Pumpkin Seeds I have ever tasted!<br />Thay have the wright amount of salt and more flaver then any pumpkin seeds that<br />I have had my whole life.<br />Where can I get more???<br />The store I bought them at doesn't have any more,and they don't know were I can<br />buy more.<br /><br />PLEASE HELP!!<br /><br />Lou TL;DR Anne's House of Nuts-Roasted Salted Pumpkin Seeds"
"First of all, there's no better condomit for anything than Heinz Ketchup. You can use it on anything and make the anything taste better: steak, hamburgers, soup, spinach, Wheaties - anything.<br /><br />My problem with the ketchup isn't the ketchup itself but the upside down bottle it's in. For Pete's sake - it's upside down! What were the Heinz people thinking?<br /><br />I'm a bit on the obsessive compulsive side and having an upside down bottle of ketchup in my fridge while everything else is rightside up makes me a little crazy. I tried turning the other things upside down so they'd get along better with the ketchup, but it was a disastrous experience.<br /><br />Thankfully, the upside down state of the bottle doesn't affect the taste too much. As long as I turn the food upside down before I put the ketchup on it, everything still tastes okay.<br /><br />I just hope this doesn't catch on with other bottled items. What if they start making shampoo bottles upside down? Then I'd have to turn my head upside down in the shower. Not only would it be uncomfortable, but I'd also end up getting water up my nose and I hate getting water up my nose.<br /><br />I just hope the Heinz people aren't connected with the Head And Shoulders people. TL;DR Tasty, but this bottle drives me crazy"
"I just switched to this food and my cats love it!  They have allergies and this food makes all their symptoms disappear.  I didn't know Natural Balance made an Ultra for cats without chicken, but am really glad we found this because even my picky tabby girl eats it! TL;DR FIVE STARS!!"
"I had been searching for this type of pasta for three years - ever since a friend in NY had served it to us - he had<br />bought it in Rome.  Could not find it anywhere locally and was thrilled to find it online.  It is like spaghetti only it<br />has a hole through the middle of it - makes it a ""fluffier"" type of pasta and the sauce can get inside the noodle. TL;DR Bucatini pasta - different and delicious"
I received my first bag and immediately included it into my favorite bread: I only used two tablespoons of Maca powder which sweetened my bread by about as much as three tablespoons of Tupalo honey would have. Maca adds a subtle sweet taste. I also use Cheyenne pepper in this bread so the Maca root countered the pepper perfectly. Summary ingredients for this bread were:<br /><br />Yeast<br />Bread flour<br />Whole wheat flour<br />Barley flour<br />Rye flour<br />Water<br />Chia seed<br />Hemp protein<br />Gluten protein<br />Cheyenne pepper<br />Maca powder<br />Salt<br />Semolina flour<br /><br />It's a nice addition to a bread that can compete with the very best I've ever had. TL;DR Adds subtle sweetness to my bread.
"I love the nonfat dried milk as well. But in looking for whole milk, found this great product.<br />Not only do I love the taste but it dissolves like magic (unlike other instant milk which tends<br />to clump). TL;DR Excellent Dried Milk Product....."
"NOTE:<br />Below is my original review.  Since this review I have bought another bag and they were TERRIBLE QUALITY.  The sticks, many of them, were skinny as twigs.  Many of the other sticks stank and were weird shapes.  This was a ""seconds"" batch.  It's tough because I know bestbullysticks.com sells perfect sticks from their own website---but when they sell to Amazon customers---I dunno---I think the ship Amazon the ones that cannot sell from their own site due to poor quality.  I will NOT be ordering from them again.  I will spend more--there are some that are about $10 more---but at least I won't feel annoyed that I got ""seconds.""  Read my original review too--it is still helpful in making your decision.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br />I've ordered three packs of this exact item from Best Bully Sticks/Amazon.  When I ordered from their own branded Website, the sticks were immaculate and had a branded label.  They were all the same size and color and seemed uniform.  I got them on sale from the brand Website and so paid what I do currently from Amazon.  When I went to order more, the sale was no longer on and they were significantly more expensive.  Amazon had the same Best Bully Sticks (odor free) and the same product count for the sale price I paid.  Excellent.  However, when I received the bag it wasn't labeled, the sticks were splintered and the sizes were not uniform and seemed dryer than my original purchase.  They seemed like seconds.  But, because of the price, and the fact that my dog didn't seem to mind--I bought them again from Amazon.  This time, though the bag was again unlabeled, the sticks were uniform and of the same quality as my first batch.  These sticks do get gooey---a good thing---when your dog starts to chew them.  So, if they do appear dry or brittle, this does soften almost immediately.  I have an 8 month old sheepdog puppy and this size seems to last him about 20mins!  If your dog is a heavy chewer and a Bully Stick addict, don't expect these or really any 6"" sticks to last more than an hour--MAX!  Again, great deal as one bully stick from Petco can be 4-5 bucks! TL;DR Update: Not A Good Buy Any Longer"
This is a wonderful flavor of Pocky and fairly common in the US. It's quite tasty and a bit more sophisticated than the normal chocolate or the strawberry creme that you can find at your local Wal-Mart.<br /><br />I recommend it to anyone who loves chocolate and almonds if not Pocky since even people who aren't really impressed with Pocky admit that they liked this flavor. TL;DR Delicious
"I much prefer other brands. This one seemed bitter no matter how I brewed it.  Judging by the other reviews I may have a different taste in Chai than most, or maybe I just got a bad box of tea. TL;DR Not so much"
I got and tried the Walden Farms Marshmallow Dip.  Don't waste your money... it tastes like poison with a terrible aftertaste. YUCK. TL;DR Walden Farms Dip
"I have previously used this saffron before, and I think it has a spectacular quality and price. I will buy again in the future this brand. TL;DR The best!"
"I used to be a big fan of Thai Kitchen's green curry paste and coconut milk. Now the curry paste has lost all its fire and the coconut milk is thinner in consistency and flavorless. Bummer, as it's hard to find quality products (of any kind) these days. Interesting note?--Thai Kitchen was recently acquired by another, larger company. Looks like the ""recipes"" have changed. As will mine. TL;DR Great Product Ruined"
"My  family is a  big fan of soups and stews.  These Blackeye Peas (Beans) make a wonderful soup when you add ham with ham bone, finely chopped onion, finely chopped celery, lots of freshly ground pepper, and a bit of salt (to your taste). I also use Knorr Beef base to boil the ham w ham bone first. I also do a pan of cornbread made with Quaker corn meal. These beans do not have to be soaked overnight...a big plus.<br />The thing here is that all this can be done in a crock pot or on the stove top easily.  Blackeye peas (beans) are so very healthy  for you and your family.  Sometimes when I make vegetable soup I add about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of blackeye peas. I also add about the same amount of pearl barley.<br />Now, I am going to make a plea to all you good folks out there. Please start making your meals from scratch. Involve the kids.  All my soups and strews make great left overs or re-heated for the kids when they get home from school and sports.  This is not hard, OK?  It just takes a bit of planning and fore thought.  Let's all get healthy.  Let's cook and eat together again as families.  I know that your kids will love to cook with you as mine did.  I also taught them to bake. . .we started with my grandmother's great chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now both of my sons are married and approaching their 40's. In their own homes they both help a lot with the cooking, baking, and housework.  They also love camping, fishing, hunting, golf. . .and football.<br />I hope that you purchase these beans.  I love the packaging and the freshness. The quality is superb. My blessings go to each of you, your kitchens, and your families! TL;DR Show Your Love. . .Make a Good Soup for Dinner!"
"I love mallomars, and after moving to the west coast from NYC attempting to find them was disappointing, so I was so excited when I saw them on Amazon.  Unfortunately the ones I got were old and stale (the chocolate had that white film on it) so I was super disappointed.<br /><br />I found them at a few local stores around here so that makes me happy, but I don't think I'll be buying groceries off Amazon again any time soon.  :C TL;DR Stale old Mallomars"
"I admit it, I'm a tea snob. Tea isn't a beverage for me, it's an event, starting from boiling the water to when the last drop vanishes down my oesophagus.<br /><br />And as a snob, I don't buy bagged teas, I buy loose leaf. So I normally wouldn't have drank this tea, except that I filched a couple of complimentary bags while waiting interminably at the local dealership (OK, I drank one at the dealership and stole 3, one for each hour I was kept waiting).<br /><br />On the matter of taste, I find it very good. The Bigelow EG appeared to be very strong in color and taste.<br /><br />Tea bag teas are usually cut very fine so the tea bags can be packed flat, and because finely cut leaves have more surface area than big leaves, you don't need to steep the tea as long. In fact the instructions say to steep only 1-2 minutes as opposed to the usual 3-4 mins.<br /><br />To me, Earl Grey taste has two components, the tea taste and the bergamot taste, and it takes a lot of skill to blend and make a tea that has a pleasing combination of the two tastes.<br /><br />Taylors and Harrogate has a mild tea and bergamot taste. Whole Foods loose leaf has a strong bergamot taste. Your run of the mill EG usually has a strong tea taste that overshadows the bergamot and you don't taste it at all. Bigelow has a very strong tea taste, but it doesn't overwhelm the bergamot, which you taste at the end. So I like it very much, because I've never had a strong tea that didn't overwhelm the bergamot. And it's definitely not a mild tea, it's very robust and strong. It's not a light handshake, it's a full body hug and kisses on both cheeks when you drink this.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want a very strongly flavored Earl Grey with a strong tea taste, but also a strong hint of bergamot, this is it, I'll definitely buy some (because I think they have security cameras in the waiting area). TL;DR Very good!"
I am unsure why people are saying this is not for coffee - but that's the only way I use this product and I love it! TL;DR Not for Coffee????
"I've purchased packs of this gum at my Walgreens a couple times before (largely when it's on sale). I like its taste and how it lasts nearly an hour. It also claims to have a quarter of the recommended B6 and B12 vitamins which is cool (I don't rely on getting my B vitamins from gum, I get them elsewhere). The $14 price sold on here is a little more expensive than the periodic sale of $2.99 for a 3-pack I see at Walgreens. 5 stars for the gum, minus one for the price.<br /><br />For those suffering with acid reflux, try chewing bubble or any fruity gum. When you chew bubble or fruity gum, your mouth generates more saliva offsetting the acid and bile that's been climbing your esophagus. Even though this gum does noticeably tame my acid reflux when I chew it, don't do it like me, with mint gum like this. Mint products only aggravate the symptoms of acid reflux even more. Go for bubble or fruity gum instead. Learned it from Dr. Oz. TL;DR Good taste, nearly lasts an hour, but a little expensive"
"When I stopped drinking diet sodas, I really didn't like substituting water. However, a friend introduced me to True Lime packets, and I started using them. It made all the difference in the world. I now enjoy water! When I found the Shakers on Amazon, I started ordering them. I keep a large gallon container of water with True Lime in my refrigerator at all times. My guests also love the flavoring and a side benefit is that it is healthy. For me, water is now a pleasure to drink due to True Lime. The amount I use is geared to my taste. That is one of the benefits of using the Shaker,you are able to use measuring spoons. TL;DR Wonderful for Tasty Water"
"This product is great, it tastes good and removes harmful sugar and artificial sweeteners from something that we all love to enjoy.  But do not buy it here, unless you just love to throw you money out the window. Head over to Josephslitecookies.com and find it there for only 2.99 a bottle! I don't know how these people are getting away with charging this much. Perhaps if you live over seas and Josephs wont ship to you then you would pay extra but otherwise there's no need! As far as causing gas problems, well that depends on each individual. Some may have no discomfort what so ever, while others may need to avoid all sugar alcohols(because they all CAN cause gastrointestinal problems) TL;DR Product is great! But don't pay this price!"
I first tasted these on a trip to NYC and my wife and I were hooked.  Tough to find them around here and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.  No other baked chip even comes close to these - you would swear they were kettle fried chips but with no greasy feel.  Our current favorite snack! TL;DR I love these chips!
I find that most of the time when people order coffee it comes out looking like iced tea.  Peet's taste like coffee should taste & BANG ZOOM you're to the moon. TL;DR This is what coffee should taste like
"Ever since having my little girl five years ago, I have been dedicated to serving her wholesome, nutritious and natural foods. This can be a difficult task in today's world, with so many processed, nutritionless foods, filled with harmful perservatives and trans fat. I didn't want to deny my daughter ""snacks"", but I hated the idea of giving her foods filled with chemicals and hydrogenated oils. So it is no surprise that I was thrilled when I stumbled on Annie's Homegrown products. Here is a brand that I can serve to my child without guilt. All of their products are made with a small handful of natural ingredients that we all can recognize (and pronounce!). No partially hydrogenated oils, no preservatives, no ungodly amounts of sodium. And they are delicious to boot! My daughter goes crazy for these little cheddar bunnies! They are  perfectly cheesy and not too salty and their cute shape appeals to little ones. This is a company that cares about what you feed your children and yourself. And that is a company I am happy to support. TL;DR Finally...natural snacks that actually taste good!"
"These are yummy, fruity treat.  Can't beat the fact that it's made with mostly organic ingredients, no artificial colors or flavors... it's what my husband and I eat when we are in the mood for fruit candy and it does the trick. TL;DR Sweet Treat"
"They Nylaring is a great chew toy for any dog. Our 80lb puppy loves it and since it s a  circle she can toss it, roll it and really chew on it and it holds up great! I really recommend this chew toy. TL;DR The best chew toy for a heavy chewer!"
"This is not an energy shot.This is an immunity shot.It is a B 12 Vitamin supplement.<br />It is fruit punch flavor and they are very good cold.I keep mine in the fridge door and have one daily.<br />There is no caffeine in it.B 12 is the major vitamin with 5 mg of niacin 1.5 mg of zinc,etc.<br />I have never experienced diarrhea with this product.Not sure why it is called an energy shot in the description.<br />No where on the label does it claim to be an energy shot.Its an immunity shot drink.Fruit Punch B Vitamins supplement. TL;DR Not an energy drink"
"They taste great. They have MSG in them, though. There's not conclusive evidence that MSG is bad, but its good to warn those who are sensitive. Can't beat the deal. TL;DR If you like Peanuts"
"Had to counter the other review.  These are british peas and not like the canned peas in the USA.  Personally, I LOVE them. TL;DR Great ENGLISH peas"
"While certainly not as awful as Ginger People's ginger beer, I don't recommend it.  I love a good ginger beer, and this is all that my local grocery store carries and I still won't buy it.  To be fair, there are different styles of ginger beer and taste IS subjective.  But I can't help but feeling that something like Cock and Bull or Barritts is MUCH better and more ""authentic"".  (Although they are not nearly as natural.) TL;DR Completely unimpressed"
I bought these K-cups recently for 3 reasons:<br /><br />Wanted espresso in a larger pack.<br />Wanted something that wasn't on BACK-ORDER most of the time.<br />Wanted to pay a decent price.<br /><br />This filled the order.  I din not notice a significant taste difference from Green Mountain espresso. TL;DR Better value?
This is the second time I've purchased this peppercorn.  I love my pepper and this particular product is great.  Also worth the money. TL;DR Great Buy
I have been drinking this juice for years.  What I like about it is the lower carb value without being to sweet or having the pucker factor.  I get three bottles autoshipped once a month.  It is enjoyed as a beverage or used in our version of a Cosmo. TL;DR Excellent Juice
"I purchased these crackers because I have a wheat allergy and they are delicious.  They are not like other rice crackers I had tried.  Now everyone in my family prefers them over regular saltines, and I even have to order them for my mother in law!!!  They are crispy, tasty with just the right amount of salt, and very satisfying.  I highly recommend them.  Amazon is the best place to buy them for price and availability. TL;DR Everyone likes them!!"
"I drink my coffee black no suger and this is 10 times better than the dark roast I was drinking, much smoother. Enjoy TL;DR very good"
"The soup base is disgusting. I ordered this with high hopes on all the rave 5 star reviews. I'm sorry people, but you have some messed up taste buds if you think this is the best ramen you ever had. It taste very strange, like seaseme seed oil. It smells terrible. I should have never order this product and continued to order Nong Shim's Shin Ramyun. I really don't recommend anyone actually drink broth for It's a very thick dark fluid that stains anything it touches. It will probably damage your liver. Not to mention all the sodium and MSG. Now I don't know what to do. If anyone can tell me how to make it taste better please tell me so I don't waste the rest of these. TL;DR Not Good..."
"This is the best sugar you can buy!  The taste is earthy, the aroma of molasses.  When you make a 1 to 1 by volume sugar syrup, it will have the color of coffee! TL;DR The BEST sugar on the planet!"
"Awesome! Great tasting and good for you too.  Terrific for backpacking, bicyling or just anytime you want a lift!  Chocolate, coffee and ginger. What a combo.  Yummm! TL;DR Best Bar yet!"
"I'm very satisfied with these beans, I've bought two packs of them now from JR Mushrooms & Specialties.<br /><br />They come nicely vacuum packed so they remain super fresh until you open it, and when you do it smells wonderful! The beans are plump and moist.<br /><br />Aside from making some nice desserts with it (panna cotta, chocolate dipping sauce, etc...) I've made vanilla extract as well using some good quality vodka. It has such an AMAZING aroma and flavor, I have to give credit to these beans. I totally recommend making your own vanilla extract using these beans, you'll never go back to store-bought again. TL;DR Great quality beans, super low price!"
"Whenever I read recipes for baby food, the amount of work that goes into them--chopping, cooking, blending, pureeing, etc.--seems really daunting. So I was really happy to find the Babycook, which does everything: you just steam your fruits or veggies, dump them out of the basket into the bowl and puree them. Ridiculously easy to use. It's also very easy to clean, as the blade is detachable. I've experienced the lime buildup that other reviewers have complained about, but descaling it the night before I plan to use it keeps it perfectly clean. TL;DR Makes life so much easier!"
"Golden Mountain Sauce is the secret ingredient that makes Thai dishes come alive. You may be able to find it in Asian food stores by the Thai fish sauce.  You can also order it from one of the Asian gourmet or grocery vendors at Amazon.com.  Look for ""naturally fermented"" on the label; otherwise you may be buying hydrolyzed soy protein (used in fake soy sauces) which is unhealthy and potentially toxic in high levels.  Check with the vendor PRIOR to purchasing to ensure you are getting the ""naturally fermented"" product. TL;DR The secret to classic Thai taste"
"These are stunningly delicious.  If you heat them for a few seconds in the microwave (or take them along on a hot summer day's picnic), they're soft and chewy and addictive. TL;DR Yum! times 10"
This pacakge is a super good deal comparing with the 2.5-pound bag - it is about 50% cheaper than buying four 2.5-pound bags. TL;DR Super good deal
"I have two dogs, both Pomeranians. One is 16 and has no teeth, and the other is eight and an extremely picky eater. My older dog will eat just about anything, so it was no surprise to me that the minute I poured this into a bowl he beelined straight for it and tried to chow down. Only -- poor dog -- these pieces were too hard and too large for him.<br /><br />The picky eater, on the other hand, gave these a whiff and timidly tried a few bites. In my household, this is a success! It's a rare story for him to even try anything new we buy for him. We leave these out all day for the dogs to eat whenever they get hungry and I will spy the picky dog going for a nibble throughout the day. TL;DR My dogs love it!"
"I believe I prefer this cake mix to the regular ones.  I grew up on home made cakes and am not crazy about cake mixes, but I'm lazy.  I tried this one because its peanut free and we have an allergy in the household.  Much to my surprise I really liked the cake.  It's moist.  I doesn't taste fake like most mixes.  Its not overly sweet.  And its wonderful rich chocolate but not overly sweet.  I really appreciated not having to have eggs or milk, since I don't always have those items in the house.<br /><br />The cooking time was a bit of a problem.  I don't remember how much longer it took than the directions, at least 5 minutes, probably longer.  If your toothpick comes out wet, believe it.  It isn't done yet. TL;DR Very good chocolate cake"
"I used to love Zico coconut water. No any more. This new formula is terrible. It taste nothing like how coconut water is supposed to taste. First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of ""natural flavors"", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CN7BMA"">ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />These may be cost-cutting moves and they show. This product is terrible. Go with the original non-concentrate Tetra-paks. TL;DR Really icky stuff. Go with the Tetra-Paks instead"
I'm not even a big fan of dark chocolate but these nuts are delicious! They are the perfect thing to snack on to help rid sweet cravings and they contain the same amount of fat/calories than the plain almonds. They don't even have added sugar! TL;DR Delicious!  Bye Bye Sweet Cravings!
"I bought this tea because it had good ratings, though I was a bit afraid that I was not going to like the taste based on other comments.<br /><br />Well, I loved it.  The taste is very herbal and may be a bit bitter (do NOT use boiling water to make the tea).  I add a bit of sugar to make it more palatable, and I actually like its taste.  Also, I noticed that it indeed does give me energy, at least as much if not more than caffeine.  It's more of a long-lasting stamina feeling, not necessarily the rush energy caffeine gives.  Also, I never feel like I crash a while after drinking it as it sometimes happens with coffee.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this tea. TL;DR Great tea!"
"I have used these bags for the past 6 months. I used to love them and liked that they are biodegradable, but the last box I bought contained a lot of damaged bags. I thought it was one bad batch, but it keeps happening with bags from different batches. I have lost over 30 ounces of breast milk in the past month and one day didn't have the regular amount to send with my son to daycare. Breastfeeding mamas know the devastation of losing even an ounce can cause so losing this much has been beyond upsetting.  I caution you to be very careful when using these bags for milk storage. TL;DR They worked really well until they started leaking"
We had apple sections dipped in hot caramel fondue and crushed nuts without leaving the hearth. The Kraft Caramels make it easy enough to start it a tradition. TL;DR Like the boardwalk
GREAT PRODUCT TO MIX WITH DRY FOOD. WE HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS. BOTH OUR GREAT DANES JUST LOVE IT. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. TL;DR IAMS GRAVY
"Another reviewer said that this hot sauce seems diluted and cream-like, and I personally disagree.  While it is definitely mild, this is one of the most flavorful sauces you can find by Dave's Gourmet.  I rarely find it when I go out to local shops, so I try to buy several bottles of this sauce online whenever I miss it too much.  It's good on fries and with potato chips, and I would offer this to any visiting friends or relatives that want to feel included when you're using hot sauces, but who can't really stand the burn of something that's actually hot.<br /><br />If you're looking for a garlic flavor in a sauce, try this one.  I strongly recommend it. TL;DR I like this garlicky sauce D:"
"I love Barilla pastas, but De Boles is a very delicious alternative. The things I love about Barilla -- always cooks al dente, doesn't stick together -- also applies to this brand.<br /><br />It's a little expensive though -- even when you purchase by the case like this -- but a healthier choice for people who are trying to cut down on carbs. Unfortunately it still has WHEAT in it as well as the jerusalem artichoke flour, so for people who are trying to avoid wheat products it cannot be used as a subsitute. TL;DR Healthier choice / great taste!"
These are cute little bones with knots on both ends made of rawhide.  I ordered 100 of them.  They're perfect for small dogs but I should have realized how small they were.  My malinois has one gone in second.  Overall a good product. TL;DR knotted rawhide dog bones
this stuff tastes horribles. its has to be healthy if it taste bad enough to make your eyes tear... TL;DR yuk...
"I would prefer to have a bit stronger coffee, but overall, I am a regular customer of this German Chocolate Cake Coffee...I do not think you will be disappointed...a hint of coconut with chocolate...not a hot chocolate drink...it is coffee with the flavors...I recommend it... TL;DR A Bit Pricey...but great taste!"
"Based on the positive reviews and the organic certification I gave this a try. The taste is very sweet, which from the reviews, I expected. The texture is rubbery or plastic like, not at all like the real jerky I used to get in the south out of the jars in the truck stops. It may be organic, but it tastes like organic rubber to me. TL;DR Rubbery"
"I first had this tea while in South Africa and found the Rooibos tea to be superior to any other I've ever tasted.  Highly recommend!  I'm so glad I can get it through Amazon. TL;DR Great tea, no grittiness, very smooth"
"I love this product.  In addition, to using it as a dipping spice, I use the spices in eggs, on chicken, in pasta and even add it to cream cheese and bagels to give the bagels and different flavor. TL;DR Great Product, Many Uses"
"I first tried this while on a trip to Europe, and after visiting the Starbucks where it was sold three times in one day to get more bottles of it, I knew I was hooked! I ordered it on amazon when I got back, and it came quickly and carefully wrapped. The flavor is light and slightly sweet, sort of crisp (I'm terrible about describing taste!). Is it pricey? Yes. But is it worth it? I think so :) TL;DR Light and sweet"
"Excellent.  We have enjoyed Yuban coffee for many years.  We recently tried the Dark Roast Coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee.  Smooth; with no bitterness.  Beats the high price of many ""Gourmet Coffees"" without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for. TL;DR great coffee great price"
"Don't buy this food if you are looking for the primary ingredient to be meat.  The ingredients list on the product page on Amazon says ""Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Meal, Ocean Fish Meal"" before any grains are listed.  This is wrong.  The package as well as Chicken Soup website list it this way ""Whole Grain Brown Rice, Chicken, Turkey, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal""  While it's possible that it may still contain enough meat, I still don't trust that it does.  Any dog food you buy should contain 1 or 2 (Meat)meal ingredients before any grains are listed.  If it doesn't say ""meal"" after the meat, it means the meat weight was measured before the meat was dehydrated.  If it says ""meal"" after the meat, the weight was measured after the meat was dehydrated.  Therefore, ""meals"" constitute more meat in the product composition than meats listed without meal after them.<br /><br />From the ingredients list on Amazon for this product, I expected the meats included were less fatty, hence the ""light"" description.  This is not entirely the case.  They have reduced the meat and upped the grain in this formula.  Either get the regular version of the Chicken Soup food or consider another food.  For more info on dog foods, google ""Dog Food Analysis"".  Some good budget friendly alternatives that are better and cheaper than this product are the Diamond Naturals dog foods.  Amazon carries these foods as well.  Search for ""Diamond Naturals (meat here) and Rice""  They have chicken, lamb, and beef varieties.  Also, Diamond Naturals makes the Chicken Soup line of foods, but they are typically cheaper.  Just some food for thought. TL;DR Wrong ingredients list"
"Couscous is finally a very popular alternative to rice, pasta and potatoes in the USA, but most of the couscous is not produced in Morocco.  My first taste of couscous was years ago in Paris and the Dari brand is the most similar to what I tasted first in 1975.  You do not need a couscous pot for this product, but you certainly can prepare the traditional meal by separating individual semolina grains into light, fluffy particles by rubbing it between the hands if you so desire.  With neither the inclination nor time, you can prepare it as simply as you'd like by using a microwave, boiling water and a few fluffs with a fork.  Dari produces semolina, barley and corn couscous at this time and I'm looking forward to trying the barley which is currently available on Amazon. TL;DR Morocco's quality couscous"
"Tried this product because Great Northern Popcorn was temporarily out of stock and unavailable. While the flavor is good, this Wabash Valley Farm brand doesn't generate nearly as much finished popcorn and its biggest disappointment is that it isn't very crisp...it almost tastes stale. I would recommend Great Northern's product over this. TL;DR Disappointing..."
"Making praline from scratch is a time-consuming activity and I have been happy to find this product on Amazon. This praline is smooth and tasty, it is delicious on toast or mixed with melted chocolate. I only wish it was not that pricey. TL;DR Excellent, hard-to-find product"
"My Dachshund was a bit overweight and having skin issues. Our local pet supply store recommended this food to promote healthy digestion and overall good health. My dog has slimmed down considerably; I carefully measure the food. Also, her coat is shiny and soft. She loves this food and I don't have to mix in wet food for her to eat it. The online price is also much better than our local store ($8 for 2 lbs). TL;DR Excellent Dog Food"
"Taste matters A LOT if that's all you'll be having until lunch.  This tastes terrific.<br /><br />A single packet, 3/4 cup of milk, and 3 ice cubes whirled in a blender or Magic Bullet and you have got yourself a tasty breakfast.<br /><br />Great for on-the-go mornings. TL;DR Great Taste!"
"I started buying quinoa when I was exercising religiously. Even though I don't exercise like I use to I still keep quinoa in my diet, because of how versatile it is; not just with its nutrient content, but also with its cooking. I use to buy this product from a local health food store. I'm paying a lot less by buying it here. Definitely worth it. TL;DR Good Stuff"
"I used to use Bigelows green tea in tea bags. After purchasing  a Keurick Kcup machine I finally found their Kcups on Amazon . For me this tea is just right at 12 oz. If I want it a little stronger I just cut back on water. A little squirt of lime juice makes it perfect. I receive my orders from Amazon fast, as I have 2day shipping. I will continue to use Amazon and Bigelow tea in future. TL;DR Green tea Bigelow"
I have the Keurig My K-Cup and found it to be annoying to have to pull out the insert to use it after I use an actual k-cup.  This eliminates that and I've found it to make a better cup of coffee as well.  It's a nice one piece design so no messing with the 3 pieces like the My K-cup.  Works great. TL;DR Best reusable filter for K-Cup yet!
"I am a *huge pasta fan,  really I am.  Anyone that knows me personally knows I prob.  dream about pasta at least three times a week.  hah!<br /><br />This is really tasty stuff.  Reminds me of Vodka Sauce.  Not to mention you can make it look really pretty if you put a little love into it.<br /><br />It's really easy to make!  Just warm up the powder and milk and mix it all together in a small pot..  Have the cooked pasta ready.. then mix it all together in one pot! THEN!  Place it on a cute little dish.. in the middle.. and put some green next too it... to add color!  and its a cute little meal!<br /><br />Really,  I love this stuff!! TL;DR Flashy and tasty pasta in a pinch!"
This is growing fine but I have the 3 pod model and the tomato plant is so tall that it is burning itself on the light.  It said this plant was compatible with the 3 pod model but I'm not so sure.... TL;DR too big for my machine?
Excellent coffee product.  Bought for my espresso maker but also use in my drip coffee maker and is great either way. TL;DR LavAzza Crema
"I really like these crackers.  They don't directly correspond to any ""regular"" crackers that I can remember, but the texture is unlike the typical GF cracker. Very good! TL;DR Schar Cheese Bites"
"With all the publicity regarding health benefits of dark chocolate, Vivani is one of the best I've tried. It has a creamy, full-bodied taste that is definitly chocolate. The ingredients are organic and each bar has 72% cacao. For someone who enjoys dark chocolate, Vivani tastes too good to believe that it provides health benefits. TL;DR Excellent chocolate"
"These are really excellent. Perfect meal replacement, or after-workout nutrition. I have one every day. After trying a zillion nutrition bars, these are the best in class. TL;DR Love these."
This is one of the best pastas i've ever eaten. My family of 7 all like it better than most every other pasta we've tried gluten free or otherwise.  Highly recommended. TL;DR Best pasta out there
"At first I was very leery about a flavored coffee in whole bean form. My experiences with other brands left a lot to be desired, although the same coffee being flavored AFTER it was ground tasted far better. I fell in love with Maui coffee a few years back while in Hawaii where I also acquired my taste for the macadamia nut. It has been over 10 years since I have enjoyed the true island experience, until now. It is a very rich, smooth, and full flavored coffee; I highly recommend! TL;DR Smooth"
We really like this coffee. It has a wonderful mellow taste as we don't like strong coffee. Will continue buying it because it is not offered in stores around where we live. TL;DR Coffee
My husband gave up coffee for the sake of his health and religious observation.  He was missing the hot beverage in the morning until I remembered that Pero was allowed. It took awhile to locate a vendor as it can't be found here on the Eastern Shore. It solves the problem and he can't live without it. TL;DR The Good Stuff
"I've got them on auto ship because they are the best tasting potato chip I've had in a long long time, if not ever.  I had to limit myself to 2 bags at a time because I just wouldn't stop eating them; too easy to keep opening another bag. TL;DR The Best Ever Chip"
"I love Bob's Red Mill products and my pantry is always stocked with their almond flour. This shipment came incredibly fast (less than 24 hours after I placed the order!!). It was very fresh and at a great price. TL;DR Great product, fair price, Lightening fast delivery"
"WARNING WARNING WARNING! I searched for gluten-free oatmeal raisin cookies on Amazon and these cookies came up on the list. These cookies are NOT gluten free. Yes, they contain no wheat, but instead, they have barley flour. Wheat, barley and rye all have natural gluten and *must* be avoided. Do not buy these if you have Celiac disease -- that is, are gluten intolerant.<br /><br />Amazon should fix their search engine to NEVER display products that are not truly gluten free when people search for such. Even now, on the review form, Amazon is suggesting ""gluten free"" and ""celiac"" as tags for this product. That is flat out false. TL;DR WARNING: NOT Gluten Free"
"The Atomic Fire Balls I ordered from Ferrara were exactly what I was looking for after finding ""Sams"" had disconued carrying them in bulk. TL;DR Atomic Fireballs:Greeaattt!Atomic Fire Balls. They wereexactlywaht the doctor ordered."
"I found this at our local grocer ( at a fraction of the price here ) labeled as a fruit spread ( not fruit conserv ). It has lots of strawberry pulp, seeds, etc. and is not overly sweet. The best tasting spread I've found so far. TL;DR Excellent fruit spread."
Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and I'm not completely sold on it.  I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs* TL;DR meh
"I am not able to by Amy's chilie at my local store and it was a decision which one to buy as a case, as they are all so good.  I choose the vegatarian as it is a neutral and knew it would pass everyone's taste test.  The Hot Chilie is Hot, I like it but have also mixed it with  a medium.  This veg chilie is great by itself, or  over a potato or served with rice and beans or in a taco with ""the fixings"".  Very good item for the pantry. It  doesn't have that canned food taste and does not have a pop top. TL;DR Nice to have on hand"
This is a great assortment we love it!  Always a few new ones plus old favorites! Nice job! I have ordered this twice already and will again! TL;DR Nice variety!
"Bought this for visitors to the house who don't drink coffee.  Overall it is pretty good.  I would like it to be more creamy, but still it tastes nicely chocolaty. TL;DR Pretty good"
"the ready to feed product makes feeding my daughter so much easier than mixing formula, and with the subscription service it is an amazing deal TL;DR makes life easier"
"I have had a milk allergy all my life that I didn't know about so I kept having to take antibiotics for reoccuring sinus infections. As a result, I became resistent to many antibiotics and began getting MRSA sinus infections. I learned about the healing value of honey against bacteria and began using it for irrigating my sinuses twice daily. It doesn't totally cure the infections but it does help make them more manageable as this is one of those chronic conditions that people sometimes have to live with. Sharon Rasmussen TL;DR Healing Honey"
Yummy Yummy Yummy.  My son and I enjoyed them so much that it didnt take long for the shipment of popcorn.  Great product to offer. TL;DR G.H. Cretors popcorn
"The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company (NYSE: SMG) is the world's leading marketer of branded consumer lawn and garden products. The publicly traded company has donated $200,000 to the Restore Our Future super PAC supporting Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. That makes Miracle-Gro among the first public companies to act on the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which allows direct corporate spending on election campaigns.  ""Corporations are people, too"" according to Romney.  This action is clearly fertilizer, but of the more traditional kind.  Traditional, natural fertilizer from bulls, chickens or other sources is a far better choice for your plants. TL;DR Manure"
"The other review on this is harsh and incorrect.  This honey is really great, I've bought it twice.  What the other reviewer fails to mention is that in the US the regulations are different and UMF if not a designation recognized by the FDA so it is not required on the packaging. You usually find it on bottles actually imported from New Zealand so if you really want to pay extra for that then go for it. However to call someone a fraud when their company has been in business for so long is rude. If you don't like the honey well then...don't buy it.<br /><br />Their customer service has been great, the only issue I had is that one of the glass bottles I purchased broke in the mail and I left a message which was promptly responded to and a replacement bottle was sent right away with many sincere apologies. I have more trust in a company that has been around for so long and has great Amazon reviews over someone who is adamant about designations, but relies on his sense of 'taste' to evaluate what he is complaining the company isn't evaluating scientifically.<br /><br />This honey is great tasting and worth it! TL;DR Really Great and a good price"
"This cereal was great!  Sweet enough that the kids like it but not overly sweet.  I also liked that it didn't immediately lose it crunchiness in milk, which means you can take your time eating your breakfast and it will still taste good when you finish.  Have bought again and will continue to buy it again. TL;DR Awesome cereal the whole family loves!"
"Although my dogs love the taste of this stuff, it's a little runny and tends to flow out of the grooves after I squirt it on groovie-bones, etc. The Peanut Butter Stuff'n Paste is thicker and works better. TL;DR Liver Paste - pretty runny"
"This is the best taffy ever, the soft chewy banana taffy is still the same as it was 30 years ago. I would recommend this candy to anyone who love the taste of banana and taffy rolled into one! TL;DR Brought me back to the 80's!"
I ordered Haribo Black Licorice Wheels and it arrived on time and packed in good condition.  The product was fresh and I was very satisfied with the product and price. TL;DR Great Taste and fresh
I received a complimentary Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie from Influenster.com for review purposes. This cookie is huge and hearty! This is literally the first Oatmeal Cookie I have ever been able to get my picky teenage son to eat! Very soft! Just like homemade! Quaker has really outdone themselves! TL;DR Delicious!!
"My cats RUN after their Greenies.  I throw the Greenies across the wooden floor and the cats take off - sometimes not for a soft landing.  They usually put the breaks on and slide around.  They love it when I throw one into a box.  I look at treat time as exercise time, and treat guests to a showtime. TL;DR Kitty Showtime"
"I like to first state that I used this product in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R"">West Bend 82306X Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a>, not a traditional kettle popcorn maker like you see at the theater.  The other reviews all state that the popcorn once popped is really salty. I did not have this experience and quite on the contrary found it to be not salty at all.  This might be due to the difference in popping machines.  In the stir crazy when I poured the popcorn/salt side into the machine the salt all fell into a pile.  The stirring arm on the machine probably wasn't able to move the salt around like in a kettle type machine.  I also feel that the package does not include enough of the oil to make the popcorn really flavorful.  There was plenty to pop and flavor it but I think I just prefer more oil in my popcorn.  Lastly, the kernels while tasting pretty good did not pop as big as Orville Reddenbacher.  They weren't as fluffy and were more dense as well.  On the plus size they did not have a lot of husks to get stuck in your teeth like the ""Gold Medal"" brand I've tried recently.  Overall a pretty good product to use in the Stir Crazy.  When I get a kettle type machine in the near future I will definitely be trying these packs again to see if there is a difference in the taste based on the type of machine. TL;DR Not bad for what you pay"
"Not exactly sure what to say about Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, as I know virtually nothing about pH balance or any of the medical/health claims made on the side of the bottle. From the POV of a novice though, it tastes like water, apparently very expensive water, judging by the price tag. It has a very clear and clean taste, and although I personally enjoyed the water, if all your looking for is a clear and clean taste, there are probably cheaper options out there. TL;DR Just Water Baby"
What else can you say it is Velveeta. This is a great product now as in the past. Just a little less fat. Items were delivered quickly and arrived swiftly and in good  condition. TL;DR How good it is
"I have ordered over 6 boxes of these spitz sunflower seeds with great success but I just opened my second box on this order and I will never order these from Amazon again. They are small, stall, no taste, and cannot be eaten. The first box of 12 was ok but the second box was terrible.<br /><br />Please note that who ever is sending these is not doing a great job. Very disappointed and will look elsewhere for this product. TL;DR Bad order of sunflower seeds"
"This is an excellent Colombian coffee--a bit stronger than Eight O'clock, but still smooth. The only thing I don't like is the variation in price...when the price goes up 30% in less than two months while others remain the same, I'm not buying. Hoping it will come back down. TL;DR Great taste but..."
"The box says this is a meal and @ $5.00 and 400 calories it should be a meal, it's not. Inside the box there are packages of crackers, a nut fruit mix, chili lime salmon, edamame and a square of chocolate. When I opened the box I was a little disappointed at the serving size of the chili lime salmon compared to the size of the edamame.  For the price I would expect more salmon and less edamame to make up the 22gms of protein, my mistake. The salmon looks like baby food but it is tasty. There is a fork and not a knife in the box which makes it hard to get all of the salmon from the little container. The edamame is over dried with not much taste. It gets kind of powdery when you chew it and it made me cough from the texture getting caught in the back of my throat. You'll need a lot of water to wash them down with. I had to give up eating them because they kept choking me. I did enjoy the fruit and nut mix and the chocolate was really good so it wasn't a total loss.<br />I consider the the price to be the biggest negative in this review. At almost $5.00 a box this is an expensive snack. I won't be buying this. TL;DR An expensive snack for 4.48oz of food."
"Mary's crackers are the BEST! Very crunchy, healthy, great to dip in hummus. I originally bought them at Costco, but they don't sell them anymore, darn!! Didn't know what size I had bought in the past, so when I saw them on Amazon, I ordered them. The 6.5oz size was smaller than I had purchased previously. When I received the 3 box pack for $27, I realized I payed $9 per box, which was a major ripoff!! Won't be doing that again..... TL;DR Price a ripoff"
"I tried this product for mainly breath freshening and it worked very well. I have a 2 year old lab/pit mix and she loves them and makes her breath instantly better. I tried many other products, but this seemed to work best. TL;DR Great Product!"
Loved this coffee!!!  It's the best I've had yet.  Compared to other brand names including a famous mail order company that gives away a free coffee maker with the first purchase.  Not sure if I can use other brand names.... TL;DR Best Flavored Coffee yet
"I like the flavor of the black sesame in foods. It looks good and tastes is pleasing. I had to roast the seeds to enhance the flavor then add it to the rice. For the price, I think I got a good deal. TL;DR Black Sesame"
"I ordered a bunch of these, and was enjoying a bag now and then.  I opened a bag tonight and the snacks taste STALE!  The bag is stamped with a freshness date of May 15, 2012.  That's still almost 2 months away from today's date.  They just don't taste good anymore.  Would not purchase again. TL;DR They seem to go stale FAST!"
"Last weekend I had to chance to BBQ one of these bad boys up for my 3 Wolf Moon T-Shirt / City of Heroes Supergroup. I chose to take the Beer can Chicken approach, but replaced the Chicken with Rabbit and the Beer with Red Bull. All I can say is that it was scrum diddlyicous. After dinning on this fine vermin, we settled in for a night of online gaming. I kid you not, this meat of the gods improved our game play by at least 30%. TL;DR Beer Can Wabbit"
"My mother got a job in a diner in Oakland California when she was 17 years old (she is now 91, she loved the coffe they served, Farmers Brothers) 55 years later I went to work for a Hotel that served Farmers Brothers coffee I took some coffee to make a pot for my mother and she immediately knew it was Farmers brothers coffee she remembered this coffee after all those years. I still use it it's the only coffee that we use it dosen't leave a after<br />taste in your mouth.  It's the BEST TL;DR Since 1937"
These are great tasting coffee candy. They taste very much like coffee without the overly sweet taste.  I can't drink coffee so these work great.  My co-workers really liked them too. TL;DR United Coffee Candy
"I am gluten intolerant and have been gluten free for 2 months.  I really like this flour blend.  I made brownies with this from a recipe in her baking cookbook.  I am very happy with both purchases.  My family and I enjoyed the brownies, they were good. Also a gluten free friend liked it too. TL;DR gluten free mama, almond blend"
"I was excited to try this cookie because Billy Crystal's character calls it the ""best cookie ever"" in the iconic ""When Harry Met Sally,"" which is one of my favorite films ever.<br /><br />The cookie does not disappoint.  It's rich with chocolate, gooey with marshmallow, and crunchy with vanilla sandwich cookie on the bottom.  Messy, lots of crumbs and pretty darned good.  A Mallomar is a terrific treat for late-night snacking while watching Turner Classic Movies.<br /><br />Recommended. TL;DR The cookie from ""When Harry Met Sally"" is delicious treat"
"This Product - Dove Men with Care Body and Face Wash, Sensitive Skin, 18 ounce (Package of two) is difficult to find in stores.  The price at the store and Amazon's advertised price is not very different but you can order this product and have it delivered as needed, which is a huge blessing when it is doctor recommended and you cannot find it at the store.  I love the fact that it comes in a 2-Pack.  By the time he has used all of the product, or almost all of it, it is time for another shipment.  Amazon is the way to go if you are in a situation that you cannot do without!  I purchase almost everything from Amazon.com!<br /><br />Most Sincerely,<br />Rebecca Stewart<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DBS91O"">Dove Men with Care Body and Face Wash, Sensitive Skin, 18-Ounce (Pack of 2)</a> TL;DR This Product was Recommended for my Husband by a Dermatologist - Luckily Amazon had it in stock!"
Olives in a jar are hard to find if you want an olive antipasto.  at the deli you wind up paying $3 for a small plastic tub.  these are grea and very reasonably priced.  you do need a large plastic tub or 10 small plastic storage tubs to keep them in.  they take up room but they also go very fast TL;DR If you like olives you will love these
"I am not a coffee lover, and really enjoy this product.  It's enough to get caffeine, and I really enjoy in the mornings. TL;DR Enjoy"
My doxies love these chews! I'm not sure if they are helping with tartar buildup but I'm hoping so. Time will tell. TL;DR Great dental chews!
Order was placed promptly and was shipped within 2 days. Well packed and the product itself is excellent. Amazon does a great job! TL;DR Excellent!!
"This is our favorite coffee and it is at a decent price too, it comes in a big brown box and the K-cups are loose in the box but I put them in a plastic container I have so it is fine with me. TL;DR Our favorite"
"Im not a vegan and most would say im not a very healthy eater. I bought these hoping to have a healthy ""fast food"" option in my office. I was ready for a horrid taste but was shocked by how good they actually are. You cant even tell that they are healthy. :) TL;DR Surprised by great taste"
My daughters tried their first Happy Hippos while visiting Spain. They have been obsessed ever since. The hippo character along with the creamy centers make these endearing little treats. TL;DR Happy Hippo Cravings
I like kale but never tasted anything so disgusting in my life. Perhaps I had a bad batch but they were extremely bitter and stale. TL;DR Bitter
"As a diabetic household, this sugar free breakfast syrup product is perfect...very convenient and always fresh.  Order received on a timely basis. TL;DR Very convenient product packaging"
"This is our fave Kcup coffee! with GM Half Caff coming in 2nd place.  Nantucket is smooth, not bitter.  Good buy :) TL;DR Love Nantucket!"
"It is damn tasty for instant noodles, but if you think it does not have MSG you are mistaken.  Manufacturers are getting clever with naming things.  Hydrolyzed Soy Protein contains MSG.  The food industry calls this a clean label, they list an ingredient that includes MSG or other harmful chemical without having to list MSG. TL;DR Hydrolyzed Soy Protein has MSG in it."
I received a 10 lb. box of Sunkist Fruit Gems and was extremely happy with the quality of the item. I have bought Fruit Gems before in bulk from a candy wholesaler and some of the pieces were sliced in half! These were perfect. TL;DR gem of a product
"I love this drink! It tastes yummy! it has a festive and intimate feel, although I found it a bit hard on my stomach. Other than that; it does boost the libido!  I did a bit of research and found out this was formulated mostly for women as an aphrodisiac! It certainly tripped my trigger! It could put me in the mood, even when I'm not! Yeaaaah baby!!! My excitement and enthusiasm works for him too! It's a great mixer, goes great with vodka, or rum. It's smells fruity, has a tangy tropical taste, and just fizzy enough to tickle your nose and delight your palate. It's a fun drink to share with your honey to stir up some romance, turn the love tunes on and see what happens next, bottoms up!!! TL;DR More fizz for you POP!"
"I truly love these crackers. I didn't think I would ever be able to eat crackers again. I eat them with chicken salad, but can also eat them with anything one would normally eat crackers. I actually like these better than saltine crackers and Ritz; they are not as salty and not as sweet. I originally purchased these from Sunflower Market, but am happy to see that I can get them from Amazon for less. Haven't tried any other Schar products, but am now willing to try. They break easier than mainstream crackers, but don't crumble in your hands. I think their delicateness adds to the ""freshness"".<br /><br />UPDATE 03/15/12: The price has gone up by $6 since I made my first order a little over a month ago; they are now $20.06. I may have to find a different source. TL;DR Didn't think I would ever eat crackers again!"
"Yes, this tea is expensive, but it's defiantly worth buying.  I have tried a variety of teas, but this one beats them all.  This is one of the few teas that has an almost drugging effect to it, leaving you with that rare infamous 'tea buzz' that is occasionally talked about.  It's mellowing qualities are great for taking a step back out of the bustle of life and enjoying the moment.  It's flavor is extraordinary, and is in a class of it's own.  I highly recommend this tea, even if it costs you a couple extra bucks. TL;DR Amazing Tea"
"I was given a combination coffee grinder/coffee maker for Christmas and decided to take a chance on Reggie's Roast.<br /><br />It has a good, subtle flavor, with just the right kick.  I recommend it to those looking for a milder blend.<br /><br />I have yet to try the other blends in the Reggie's Roast line, but if their as good as this I'll be sure to recommend them as well. TL;DR Great deal, good coffee"
"All I can say is NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM....I can eat 4 lbs in a couple days. : O<br /><br />To whoever thought this review wasn't helpful. Ok, ok, maybe I could've expanded a little bit on the textures, tastes, things like that. Sure.<br /><br />The mangos come in a vacuum sealed bag so they are fresh as soon as you open the bag, I suggest storing them somewhere air-tight to increase the longevity, although I cannot keep any for a long period of time because they will get eaten. These have a bit of fiber to them and some iron. The fiber helps with regularity. The taste is that of fresh mangos, with a slightly sort of fresh-baked scent and taste. The texture is slightly tough and fibery at the random folded and smooshed pieces or chunks. But over-all the fresh from the bag mangos are soft and chewy easy to rip apart and digest. 2 Bags is enough to last a few weeks if you eat sparingly, as probably should be done. If you eat too much you will probably experience a slight digestive detox due to the fiber content. Again, they do get a little harder if you don't seal them up properly, so I suggest an air-tight storage.<br /><br />Over all an excellent snack and product. Shipping is on-time and the quality various from very good, to slightly as good, but in MHO it's always been very good no matter what.<br /><br />:.  How's that? TL;DR Excellent"
"Have ordered this product in the past.  No problems ordering, and receiving and would easily order this product from the same merchant in the future. TL;DR Great service"
I love this honey and I never thought that I would go through so much.  I eat it on everything and I also love that it doubles as a first aid antiseptic.  It promotes healing and kills bacteria/fungi.  A true wonder of the world that nature produces something so delicious and amazing.<br /><br />Cons: I cant stop eating it! TL;DR The Absolute Best
"I compared this to the Creole seasoned nuts from Peanut Shop of Williamsburg (also called ""Mardi Gras"" flavor nuts), and the Williamsburg nuts have a much tastier seasoning. These nuts are good nuts and roasted well, but I don't find the seasoning appetizing. There's a lot of herbal flavor, possibly oregano and bay leaf, which overpower the onion and garlic flavors. There's very little heat. It's not unlike the flavors in a gumbo, which are good flavors, but not so great with peanuts, in my opinion. The salt level is high, but I like salt. TL;DR Cajun seasoning not the best"
"It's hard to order anything on the internet and be confident enough that you got a good product, let alone a great food product. Initially, I ordered this popcorn because of it's great price and relevance to what I needed, and ended up really enjoying it for the taste! The butter's consistency is hard when I received it in the mail, though it melts right up in the popper and YUM! We had great popcorn..... TL;DR Tastes better than it looks!"
"This was my first time cooking with a Prima Taste kit and was impressed by the full flavor when making curry.  I opted to use shrimp since I didn't have beef on hand and it still came out very delicious.  The flavors are complex and remind me of Thai and Malay foods I've eaten at restaurants.  For those who don't like spicy foods, this does pack quite a punch but not too over the top.  Only slight negatives - there are a bunch of little leaves (keffir lime leaves, I believe) which need to be picked out before serving or while eating as they are not really chewable.  Also, when mixing in the coconut powder blend which comes in a paper pouch, it can be messy.  It left a bit of powder around the stovetop so take extra care to open slowly and/or over the pot/pan where you are mixing the curry to avoid the extra cleanup.  Bon appetit! TL;DR makes a restaurant quality dish with lots of flavor"
So overpriced for what it is. The taste is odd and flat...not at all like what good chocolate should taste. TL;DR Tastes like cheap chocolate.
"I purchased this package of 3, 16oz cans from Amazon.com. While the pancakes/waffles are definitely edible, they aren't my favorite. I followed the package instructions on the preparation required, added the ingredients (egg, milk, butter, and of course the mix), yet found that the strawberries did not taste as good as if you were to add them fresh, some were a little hard too (I did allow the batter to set for 10 minutes as the instructions state), and overall, the aroma of the strawberries went away after cooking and adding some syrup (not alot :P). I found that my pancake mix from Trader Joe's is better taste wise, fluffier, and less expensive. This recipe, unlike other pancake recipes, requires you to add butter or oil, and I was able to taste the butter more than the strawberries, not in a good way, more in a, I know this has a good amount of butter. Would I purchase this again, no. TL;DR They're Okay..."
"I love all the Sprout Organic stage one products for far- except for the bananas- it had a funky taste to it and i didnt bother feeding it to my son... i guess i will just mash up some real bananas--- but the peas, sweet potato, pears and roasted apples are amazing and give those 5 stars!! TL;DR I love Sprout Organic....."
"I have tried a lot of other Simply Organic products and love them.  This one, however I couldn't get any of my eight kids or me or my husband to choke down.  It is not very good.  I was hoping it was, but I wasted a lot of money.......Yucky! TL;DR Yuck"
"Overall, the pizza turned out well.  I found that their 10 minute cook time would be accurate for a normal cheese pizza, but I loaded mine with tons of toppings so it took me nearly 20 minutes.  The crust came out great.  The sauce was pretty interesting too; slightly cinnamon flavored and sweet in my opinion.  Overall, for six bucks a pizza and prime shipping, you can't go wrong.  I will be ordering again in the future. TL;DR Pretty Good"
"I have tried a variety of ways to bake with this flour.  All breads come out dense, but that is the same with many flour alternatives.  But, outside of that, this is less tasty than using potato flakes and grinding them to a powder.  And, my potato flake bread came out fluffier than my potato flour bread as well.<br /><br />But, this is easier to deal with, and for time consuming tasks, it is worthwhile. TL;DR A little disappointing, but good for potato items"
I have been subscribed to this for about 6 months now and go through the two pack on a monthly basis usually. Haven't had any problems with it and the cereal is delicious. TL;DR Great Bargin
Jelly Beans arrived in a timely manner and were fresh.Amazon had the best price per pound then any other web site searched. TL;DR jelly bellies/juicy pear
"I really like this peanut butter.  It is not all doped up with hydrogenated oils and laden with salt.  It spreads nicely and tastes the way I think peanut butter should.<br />Each to his own taste of course but this suits me just fine.  It was delivered very promptly and I certainly can recommend it to those who like the ""real stuff"". TL;DR Good Stuff"
"This is a great container. Makes it easy to get to your gum and it's perfect for the office, with one exception. I find that people often ask ""May I have a piece of gum?"" and then take a HANDFUL!! Because of this, I recommend getting a normal pack for ""guests"" so they won't be tempted to take more than one.<br /><br />Or maybe I just have some greedy people in my office? But seriously, I have people taking 4-5 pieces at a time, so I was going through gum like crazy.<br /><br />Overall though, a good container and a great gum inside it. Good bubblegum taste that lasts without the sugar many brands contain, so it's better for your teeth. TL;DR great product (only one downside)"
"The entire family loved this pancake mix. It was easy to make and tasted great. We tried it with syrup, powdered sugar, as well as fresh strawberries and apple compote. I would definately purchase this again. The only problem is my family wants this every weekend and I have to double to feed my large family. It gets expensive quickly, so I do not order it as often as they would like. TL;DR YUM!"
This is a really great pancake mix.  It was fresh and pefectly packaged.  It arrived intact and was shipped very quickly.<br /><br />I mix this with Krusteaz Blueberry Pancake Mix for a really super breakfast!  It's a really tasty pancake mix that's also very healthy. TL;DR Pefect pancake mix.
"I had this tea for the second time yesterday, at a fine local tea house, and my friend and I drank two pots of this luxurious liquid.  Paris tea is one of the finest teas I have ever tasted.  It is delicious plain, and is decadent with cream and sugar.  I feel like I am sitting at an outdoor cafe in Paris while drinking this.  Very lovely! TL;DR Like sitting in a cafe in Paris..."
"What can I say..nobody buys this for the great taste. But, if you need a little help moving things along, it works very well. Can't get too much fiber. Please remember eat only the product, no need to eat the cardboard box. Yes, I know they taste the same...<br />Keep those pipes humming! TL;DR It works"
"These truffles are not to be missed! They are actually worth the calories.  If you need a chocolate fix, they really do satisfy that chocolate experience, with no regrets. They melt in your mouth and much too fast!  You will want another, but they are very rich and you can't eat too many. TL;DR Amazingly good!"
"I really loved the taste of this coffee<br /><br />I personally like the taste of Lavazza coffee<br /><br />better than that of Illy coffee.<br /><br />Both of them are excellent, but Lavazza has its<br /><br />own unique taste to it.<br /><br />It is reasonably priced also.<br /><br />It's just great. TL;DR Excellent coffee"
"I first tried this product, Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce, in a 10-inch tortilla wrap rolled with baby swiss cheese and extra-thin slices of roast beef.  I thought it added fine notes of flavors, and I would use it again for this exact purpose.  I like most of the flavors and textures this sauce brings.<br /><br />PROBLEM<br /><br />But I don't detect much jalape&ntilde;o flavor, which is one of my favorites, and which is why I chose this to begin with.<br /><br />===== Which is why I subtract ONE STAR.<br /><br />SOLUTION<br /><br />Using the nearest blade, I simply chopped up a few slices from a jar of jalape&ntilde;os (using the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00093090Y"">Victorinox 47547 10-1/4-Inch Wavy Bread Knife, Black Fibrox Handle</a>), dumped them and a little bit of the jar's juice into the bottle, and gave it a pretty sincere shaking.  Voila.<br /><br />I ordered this product rather than some similar one for a secondary purpose, which is to make the following point, which I insist you not only read carefully but also find interesting.<br /><br />As you know, the word jalape&ntilde;os is properly pronounced as follows:<br /><br />hall aah PAY nyos.  But I have heard it pronounced, and you might too, as follows:<br /><br />jal uh PEE nuhz.<br /><br />This is a remarkably poor pronunciation, and I think it might set some sort of record for the greatest density of mistakes.<br /><br />1.  It's h, not j.<br />2.  It's all, not Al.<br />3.  It's aah, not uh.<br />4.  It's pay, not pee.<br />5.  It's ny, not n.<br />6.  It's os, not us.<br />7.  And it's os, not ohz.<br /><br />That's nearly 2 mistakes per syllable, or one every 1.3 letters in only 9 letters.  Can you think of a word that is more severely mispronounced?<br /><br />===== For this I subtract TWO MORE STARS from the product.<br /><br />Although it is not my choice as a substitute for picante sauce on a taco or pretty much any Mexican food, that's just my personal preference.  It does make a striking salad dressing, and it can be used as a base for a dipping sauce for tortillo chips or the like.  And I like a little mixed into mashed potatoes or a topping for a baked potato, but again that's just me.<br /><br />I tried other applications just for this Amazon review, and here are the results.<br /><br />-- Drizzled onto a pumpkin pie<br /><br />This turned out to be just awful.  The flavors of a well-made pumpkin pie are not only not enhanced by the addition of this sauce on top of it, they are positively worsened, especially when compared to the use of a substance such as, say, whipped cream.  If you are thinking of duplicating this test just to make sure I'm not merely making this up, I recommend that you drizzle the sauce onto the top of a single slice and not the whole entire pumpkin pie as I did, just in case you get the same result and wish you hadn't.<br /><br />-- As a substitute for vermouth in a classic straight-up gin martini<br /><br />This result also was ghastly.  Whoever perfected the first classic martini did a good thing for the dlrow of people who like the classic martini, or the fourth one, as the case may be in your time zone.  Whoever thought of using Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce instead of vermouth made, in my opinion, a grievous mistake.  Another griebous mistake is to make a whole batch of martinish this way instead of just one.  Live and learn, though, right?<br /><br />-- Sunblock<br /><br />This is a closer call, so let me list the pros and the cons.  The best argument in favor of using this sauce as a substitute for any of the regular, purpose-made sunblock lotions that are approved by The United States FDA and are available in many convenient stores is that it does work in the sense that whereever you have it slathered on thick enough, it will surely reduce the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet-range radiation on your skin, I would think, to some extent or other.  I am not inclined to test the exact SPF value of this sauce under the many exact various circumstances such as Hawaii unless YUM Brands wants to fund the research!<br /><br />As a sunblock Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce does suffer from a number of problems.  One is that it slides off of pretty much any part of you that isn't bowl-shaped or at least flat and horizontal in your particular bodily configuration when it's applied.  For example, if you're lying supine you can pop open the top, which is handily hinged, and squeeze out some of this particular sauce (I have the eight-ounce size) into your navel and have a fair chance it will provide some degree or other of protection to the skin thereunder, assuming you have an innie.<br /><br />Another drawback is that no one -- at least no one I asked over a period of dozens of hours spread out over several weeks at various pools and beaches this summer -- seems to want to help you apply this exact sauce to your back.<br /><br />A third con to this optional sunblock use is that in the hot sun this sauce reeks out a noisome aroma within a three-foot radius that is not only not nearly as pleasant as the reminiscigential smell of suntan lotion, it is decidedly worse than neutral.  In fact, I think I'd rather smell three feet.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but when I balance the pros and the cons I weigh the sunblock cons more heavily.<br /><br />===== So, because of its failure as a substitute for whipped cream and vermouth and sunblock lotion, I subtract YET 1 MORE STAR.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />If you like a little jalape&ntilde;o flavor in this type of sauce, buy this product.  If you like more, you can add it. TL;DR Whipped cream, vermouth, sunblock lotion"
"As with most bread machines particularly mine, whether it's a mix or from scratch most recipes need some tweaking. This mix makes a delicious bread, but I found it necessary to add some vital wheat gluten, a little honey, and some nonfat dry milk to get it to come out perfectly. TL;DR I'll buy it again."
"My first exposure to these chips was at a local gourmet deli.  I hestitated to purchase them due to the price ($3.25 for a 2 oz bag) but I bought them anyway.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!  These taste nothing like any banana chip I have ever tasted.  They are simply DELICIOUS!!!  The flavor is sweet but non-geasy and the chips have a nice crunch with a light as air puffy texture.  The Ingredients: Just fresh Bananas and palm oil - that's it.  No preservatives - No Trans fat.  The only down side is the price, HOWEVER, if you order them through Amazon's subscription service you will get them at a better price.(you can choose how often you want them delivered).  I couldn't wait to place my order and now I will be receiving them on a regular basis.  TRY them, you won't be dissapointed! TL;DR I've gone Bananas over these Banana Chips!!!!"
"I realized today that I'm not sure what black cherry is supposed to taste like.  I've eaten lots of cherries in my day but I can't remember the last time I had a black cherry.  Now, I enjoy a can of black cherry soda, though, it's one of my favorite summertime picnic beverages.  But I'm willing to bet the flavor I associate with ""black cherry"" is some kind of frankenstein artificial flavoring skidoo unrelated to nature.<br /><br />Switch Black Cherry carbonated drink, however, is promoted as ""100% Juice"", no sugar added, and so on.  ""A perfect balance between juice & carbonation"".  130 calories in a skinny 8.3 oz can.  Ingredients: 100% juice defined as: filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, acerola and cherry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).<br /><br />I looked up ""acerola"", which is a kind of a (red) cherry.  I guess the ""black"" part of ""black cherry"" is grape and apple and ""natural flavors"". So: drinking this has not solved my ""what's a black cherry REALLY taste like?"" dilemma. Doh!<br /><br />I wonder how much vitamin C they had to add to get to 100% of your RDA, because this drink tastes just a little bit ""vitaminy"".<br /><br />It is, however, a more drinkable, less sickeningly sweet beverage than most of the usually artificially-flavored black cherry sodas I've had.  It's carbonated but I wouldn't call it the ""perfect balance"", it does indeed seem halfway between a cherry soda and a non-descript fruit juice drink.  I never knew I needed that option, but I guess it's nice to know it's out there in a handy little can! TL;DR Is this what Black Cherry tastes like?"
"Before giving these treats to my cat Felix, I wanted to make sure to include a vet's opinion of this product in my review. So, I scheduled an appointment and took Felix and the treats in. Upon inspection of the bag, my vet (Sally Foote) looked closely at the dietary information.<br /><br />Table:<br /><br />Crude Protein:  25%<br />Crude Fat:  08%<br />Crude Fiber:  04%<br />Moisture:  10%<br />Vitamin A:  2,273 IU/lb<br />Vitamin B:  14 IU/lb<br />Zinc  75 mg/kg<br />Taurin:  0.1%<br /><br />While the vet said that the Crude Fat content was a tad higher than she would like to see, the fact that it only had 1.1 calories per treat is very favorable in her opinion.The dental cleaning is a plus and my vet did compliment the product on having that but she also stated that if you are trying to do away with daily brushing, your kitty would have to eat alot of these treats.<br /><br />Now came the real test: Felix himself. When I placed one small treat in my hand and presented it to him, he was hesitant. Sniffing it, he wasn't sure if he should try it or not. At first glance, I would say he hated it but decided to try again when he wasn't distracted by anything. So, after his nap, I presented the treat to him again and this time, he eagerly cleaned it up and wanted more. I ended up feeding him 5 treats and he still wanted more.<br /><br />This morning I found the package that WAS on top of my refridgerator, ripped up and emptied on the floor. I assume he loves them! I'm gonna have to buy more. TL;DR Excellent and does clean the teeth!"
"I started buying these candies recently because my dentist told me to stop chewing gum. I usually have one driving home from work. The other day I was waiting for my husband to go out to dinner and I was starving so I had three. Big mistake. The third one burnt my tongue. Literally took the skin off. My tongue bled while I slept that night, I woke up with a throat coated with blood. Then it scabbed over and now the scabs are slowly peeling away, so I have dead skin kind of hanging off the middle of my tongue that I am afraid to remove because I don't want to start bleeding again.<br /><br />I've never in my life had this happen with any other candy. I recommend staying away from these!!!! TL;DR Dangerous, don't give to kids"
"These work great and without the need to buy the cups that go with them. Purchased due to the hit or miss use of the single use device. Just rinse out used kcups after peeling foil from top and fill with your favorite coffee then pop the lid on. Must line the hole up on the bottom with the puncture ""spike"" in the holder, but no big deal.<br />Haven't tried for a 3rd or 4th use yet, but why not. TL;DR good product"
"I really like Ahmad tea, but Amazon's description and picture of this item is wrong.  There is no Darjeeling tea in the six pack.  There is English Afternoon instead of Darjeeling.  While I like all of the teas in this variety pack, it really irks me when Amazon gets the description and picture wrong!  If you like bergamote you will like this variety pack.  The Earl Grey, English Afternoon, and English No.1 all have bergamote flavoring.  The English Afternoon and English No.1 seem to have less bergamote which is fine with me, because I don't like teas that have too much of it. TL;DR Amazon's description is wrong"
"Tofu Shirataki is simply amazing.  Anyone who says that it tastes or smells funny has not prepared it correctly.  To prepare:  drain and then rinse VERY well.  At this point, I prefer to cut the noodles up a bit.  Boil 2-3 minutes- any longer and the pasta will become tough.  Pat dry and add your favorite sauce.<br /><br />These taste just like pasta, but with SOOO many fewer calories.  This is not just a food for people 'trying to lose weight', as other reviewers have said.  This is a food for health-conscious consumers.  For me, this has been the find of a lifetime.  There are so many different recipes you can use them in, and they taste simply fantastic.  In fact, with sauce, they taste just like pasta (and who doesn't love pasta?).<br /><br />I learned about Tofu Shirataki through Hungry Girl.  On her web site, she has tons of low-calorie recipes using Tofu Shirataki [...]<br /><br />For anyone who has tried these and disliked them, please give them another try.  Make sure to drain and REALLY rinse the pasta before boiling.  The scent will vanish.  Cutting the pasta up helps as well, since it is slightly slippery.  Try it with a cheesy pasta bake, with your favorite marinara sauce, or even in soup!  The options are limitless.  This truly is a fantastic, fantastic product. TL;DR BEST FOOD FIND EVER!!!!"
I became addicted after the first order. Smooth taste and has the power to jump start my morning. I will not make the mistake of running out before reordering next time!! TL;DR Love it!
This is a product that I read about and was glad I was able to find it on Amazon. Thanks TL;DR flax hulls
"Very, very good tea. The scent is extremely pleasing and the tea is quite good. Relaxing tea that should be partaken of slowly to be enjoyed to it's fullest. TL;DR Excellent tea"
"This powder is actually very good and this would be a 4 star item if it wasn't for the product packaging. The 3 boxes arrived in a plastic bag and there was so much powder loose that I thought a box had broken and the bag torn open. Not the case, the cocoa is just in the boxes and not in a bag in the box. The cardboard box is flimsy and the edges are not sealed. What a waste of good product! I couldn't figure out the best was to store it because every time I touched the box it would poof out and make a mess. I ended up having to buy a separate container to store it. TL;DR Cocoa good, product packing AWFUL!"
"In a 54 g serving of Wheaties fuel, 47 g are sugar, or substances that are metabolized to sugar very quickly.<br /><br />Save your money and just eat a bowl of sugar. TL;DR Buy a 5-lb bag of sugar...it's cheaper"
Great dried cherries from the heart of cherry country (as I'm led to believe). Perfect for salads or a high-energy snack. TL;DR Sweet and tangy
This is a good assortment of smooth tasting green teas...if you are a green tea lover like me! TL;DR Great assortment
"I have a 26lb dog and they are the perfect size.  Larger dogs may want to trade up.  I love how they always open with no trouble.  That is a nice feature when I'm juggling the bag, a flashlight, and the leash.  I don't use the compostable aspect of them so I can't speak to that.  All told, I have bought before and I'll buy again. TL;DR Nice and simple"
really great breakfast that i keep at work for when i don't get breakfast at home. not overly sweet and has chunks of apple that are pretty good considering... TL;DR great breakfast
"I fed this to my cats for the first time tonight, and I was honestly afraid they would choke after how fast the wolfed it down! I've been feeding grain free for awhile and wanted to get them something they would eat, especially since the little one has such a sensitive stomach. Only took away one star for the price, it is a bit high. TL;DR A little Pricey, but my cats love it!"
"My Miniature poodle love this food.  I mix it with Orijen kibble and he is a happy camper.  My 15 yr old standard poodle loves it as well. TL;DR My dogs love being ""Mighy Dogs"""
"Still in process of narrowing down my personal preferences. Medium strong which is a good thing, but I get an aftertaste that I'm not crazy about - might be me. TL;DR Okay but not my favorite"
"Sample this box of 10 teabags. It's a lovely sweetish, spicy tea that's great hot or cold. TL;DR Wonderful sampling"
I like this coffee for its smoothness and mellow taste. It's not strong and is perfect for those times when you want a cup of coffee without a bite. TL;DR Smooth
"I bought one of these for my Siberian husky house dog. She recovered from a serious injury and cannot romp and play with other dogs. This toy helps keep her entertained. It is tough and can take the abuse of a husky batting it around the house. It is challenging for her to get the treats out, and it can be set from easy to harder, so you can make it easy at first, till the dog gets the idea, and then make it harder so it is more challenging. I've had several other puzzle/food dispenser type toys for her and this is the best one, hands down. TL;DR Great product"
There is a very profound difference between different ages of Manchego cheese.  3 months is completely different from 12 months.  Yet the product description tells nothing whatsoever about the age of this cheese!<br /><br />I absolutely would not consider buying this product without that information as to me Manchego that's been aged only 3 months is not even worthy of the same name as that aged 8 or 12 months. TL;DR Product description totally inadequate
"I love Stash Premium Green Tea. I drink it every day. The foil packaging ensures that it always brews up a fresh and flavorful ""cuppa"". Buying the 100 count box makes it even more affordable to drink the best. TL;DR Essential Everyday Luxury"
"I bought this product because I was looking for solid colored fruit roll-ups.  The ones in my local grocery stores all have writing on them and I need them for an edible project.  When I received these, they have 2 colors on each roll.  I will still be able to use them but am very disappointed that the product received is not as pictured. TL;DR Product recieved not as pictured"
"I bought Peanut Shop peanuts for my dad's  birthday which recently occurred and I just gifted him The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg Handcooked Lightly Salted Virginia Peanuts, 12-Ounce Tin, 3 pack, $14.31.<br />My dad is a peanut connoisseur and eats lots of different peanuts and gourmet peanuts so I was anxious to get his feedback on these nuts. Just got feedback from my mom. She said they were not very good, according to my dad. She had to cook these peanuts & add salt to make them more edible. She said they didn't taste as if they'd been cooked long enough so she added some salt to them and cooked them and that made them better. TL;DR Not the best"
These cones were exactly what I needed.  Nowhere to be bought locally and this was a great find.  Like that you only buy a protion (not 1000).  Was hesitant seeing reviews about poor packaging and broken cones in shipping.  Well satisfied that they were very securly wrapped in celophane and then in bubble wrap. Original box placed in another box for shipping.  Arrived with only 1 chipped cone. TL;DR Great purchase
"Don't know how I missed that it was only 6 cups. I was in a hurry and I kept getting all the way to check out only to find the variety pack I wanted was ""No Longer Available."" So this came up, and I thought it was equivalent.  I know I should have read carefully, but everything else for this price was at least a 12-pack.<br /><br />And to top it off, one of them was TEA, which I don't drink, and another was Hot Chocolate, and another DECAF!  So I just paid $4.60 apiece for 3 cups.  I'm calling foul on this. TL;DR Ridiculous.  I can't believe I fell for this."
"First of all I have to admit I've been pretty much spoiled on the Newmans own. I don't think there is a coffee out there that can top it. I picked up the Timothy's to see how it compared and to try something different and I like it a lot. However I would have to say so far my favorite from the Timothy's line of coffee is the French Roast Decaf (Yes, i said Decaf). I would not hesitate to buy this again, it's really good coffee. Honestly if you haven't tried it though, I would buy one of the smaller box's of it to try. I did this with a couple others that I found that I really didn't enjoy and I was happy not to have 50 of them sitting on my table. TL;DR Pretty good stuff"
"I recently purchased this at Sprouts. This is so good and it tastes just like the real thing! I choose to eat gluten free products for health reasons but really, this flavor and this company is great! Plenty of raisins and goodies inside too! TL;DR Love it!"
"After reading a lot of reviews on puppy food, I settled on Nature's Variety Prairie puppy food.  It has high quality ingredients, no by-products, and lots of vitamins and minerals for my little guy to develop into a healthy adult.  The food has made my dog's coat super lustrous; he's an almost 5 month old Pembroke Welsh Corgi.  Since switching to this brand (we were using Authority puppy food before), his coat has become super shiny and soft.  He loves the taste and it makes his poops relatively small and hard.  If switching to this brand, be sure to switch slowly by integrating larger and larger amounts of this food while decreasing amounts of the original food.  I highly recommend this product, and the price is cheaper on Amazon than at Petco! TL;DR Awesome, high quality food"
"Not the best sauce I've ever had but one of the best conventional grocery store sauces. Not sickly sweet like other sauces, the right amount of tang, and does not taste like ketchup. The best part: no HFCS. TL;DR yummy"
"I am a big drinker of tea but even for a quick brew, Lipton is made from substandard parts of the Tea plant also including the leaves. As a red rose tea the richness of color and flavor can be compared by buying other loose Tea brands and brewing the exact weight vs. Lipton. Cut the bag open and compare it with a bag of Tetley or Brooke Bond or Taj Mahal for that matter to confirm. No offense to Lipton lovers; I prefer Quality over Quantity. Enjoy your Tea otherwise :) TL;DR Prefer Tetley"
"This is a wonderful cup of tea!  Made with the traditional cream & sugar, it is full bodied and bracing.  The Kuerig brews it fast and hot. This is a wonderful cup of tea!  My son recommends this highly -- I like the decaf... My son recommends the regular. TL;DR Excellent tea."
This is a wonderful pancake and waffle mix.  I do not even pull out the non GF mixes.  Everyone prefers the taste regardless! TL;DR Good for everyone who bakes
"Everyone I know loves this waffle mix. It makes wonderful waffles. I've shared this ""secret"" recipe with friends since I found out about it from a relative. Last year I even purchased some for Christmas gifts! The mix is so easy and does not require special ingredients. I even keep a can in our travel trailer. I would suggest you order enough mix to qualify for free shipping because it keeps very well in the pantry. The waffle mix is wonderful as is, but I plan to try making them with milk or soda water as some reviewer have suggested. Enjoy! TL;DR Everyone Loves This Mix"
"This is my first K-cup purchase and my first review.  This variety mix is perfect!  I got 50, completely different K-cups.  Yes, some flavors were the same but they were from different companies so I do not consider them repeats.  Out of the 50, 5 were tea, 5 were decaf, 3 cappuccinos, 2 hot chocolates and the rest were coffee.  I am very happy and will be buying this pack in the future. TL;DR Just what I wanted!!!!!!"
"I wanted to make a Grasshopper Pie in August.  Went around to all the local stores in my area to find the waffers and was told this was a seasonal item and they don't stock until around October.  The chocolate waffers arrived well packed and on time. I only wish I didn't have to order 12 packages. Who needs 12 packages of chocolate waffers,unless you are a baker. TL;DR Chocolate waffers"
"This tea tastes like the kind in restaraunts, unless it is made incorrectly. Usually, you are recommended to add cardamon and cloves to it for enchanced flavor. I use 1 cup milk to 2 cups water ratio for making the tea and sweeten it with regular sugar or splenda. Sometimes I'll make it unsweetened and add 2 tblspn sweetened condensed milk to each cup. If you do not know how to make it properly, I suggest looking up the recipe online. There are many great sites out there which will tell you how to do it, do not count on the instructions on the back of the package for a perfect tea. TL;DR Great tea. Exactly like in restaurants."
"Arctic Zero is a tasty frozen treat with very low calories and sugar.  Definitely better when left out of the freezer to melt a lot.  It is icy, not creamy like low fat ice cream, but for 128 calrories in the whole pint, what can you expect?  Good alternative to have on hand when watching calories, but too expensive for quality of product. TL;DR good, not great"
"This is an excellent seal salt.  It crumbles in your fingertips .  The packaging is not a problem for me, I just put it into another sealed plastic bag.  This salt never hardens, it always stays in it's crystal form ready to crumble onto your favorite foods. They call this a ""wet"" salt ..... from all the other minerals in it .<br /><br />While I sometimes use it in recipes, I find it best as finishing salt just before eating . It brings out and enhances the flavor of whatever it's sprinkled to .<br /><br /> It's not Belamandil brand though, it's Marnoto on the package .<br /><br />A wonderful salt. TL;DR Excellent Sea Salt"
"I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.<br /><br />This is about the saltiest of the Compleats I've tried. The potatoes are pasty and have little flavor. The meatloaf isn't bad, except for the salt factor. TL;DR Very salty"
"Many years ago I began to suspect that sugar consumption was adversely affecting my health.  I cut it out of my diet and noticed an immediate improvement in my energy, and other great benefits as well.  I even went to a doctor and took the fasting test to see if I am diabetic or hypoglycemic but was told that I am not.<br /><br />After that, I read ""Sugar Blues"", which further confirmed for me that sugar needed to be permanently removed from my family's diet.  Since then I have searched for ways to enjoy sweet treats without the negative effects of sugar.  This syrup is delicious and does not cause any of the problems I noticed after eating sugar!  It's wonderful after literally years of not enjoying pancakes and french toast to have this excellent product.  Thank you Fifty-50; your product is not just for diabetics! TL;DR Delicious and Sugar Free - A Low Glycemic Wonder!"
Healthier than your typical cheese cracker and tastes fresher and better too! My kids love them! TL;DR My kids love these
Nature Valley Sweet & Salty bars are an excellant granola and nut food bar that tastes great and is perfect for between meal snacks. TL;DR Excellant product
"A rich, herbal tea with lots of natural sweetness. It's  hard to believe it has no sugar. A cup of this tea is satisfying and warming. The price was better with Amazon than the manufacturer. TL;DR Sweet without sugar"
"I used to buy Caffe Verona for my regular coffeepot and decided to try this for my Tassimo when it came out.  I was disappointed in the flavor.  When I would drink from the coffeepot, it was sooooo good.  It didn't seem to have the same flavor from the t-discs.  I wouldn't buy it again.  Maybe it is the strength of the t-disc?  I prefer it kind of strong. TL;DR not as good as ground caffe verona"
I love this stuff!  It is extremely hot and a little bit goes a long way.  My favorite uses are in stir-fries and on burgers.  I suppose it would be good on pizza too.  The uses are endless! TL;DR Hot stuff!
"The product shown online is not the product described, so I sent it back for a refund. Bad business and I shall not order from this vendor again. TL;DR wrongly advertised"
Very benificial tea the pomegranate red tea and also very tasty.It is caffiene free so you can enjoy it anytime.Once you've had a cup you'll find yourself going back for another.Also great with REAL LOCAL HONEY. TL;DR Good Tea
"Yea, thanks alot Amazon. I thought this was the cheese ravioli I buy in the store. WITHOUT MEAT SAUCE. Way to screw over the vegetarians, Amazon and Chef Boyardee both. :P<br /><br />I'll be thinking twice (and reading more) before I buy any other food on Amazon. TL;DR Misleading product title!"
"Had not tried this brand before but like the handy packs I can take with me when going out. Stevia is a natural and not processed with a lot of chemical that are harmful to our bodies especially the liver. One I will not name uses formaldehyde,yuck we know other uses for that,<br /><br />Stevia to me has no unpleasant after taste. It is just like using sugar. The fact this brand is organic is all the more reason to buy this brand. I make a lemon water that takes just a pinch and it is a great for that and the combo seem to be acting as an appetite suppressant for me. I know they are making no such claim just passing along something I personally have noticed.<br /><br />If you use other non sugar sweeteners you should give this a try I do believe it is the best tasting and best for your body. Enjoy. TL;DR My choice for natural no calorie sweetener."
"So far this is the best Almond Butter I have tried.  It is very creamy and smooth.  My only gripe is that the Jars are so small, but at least you get 3.  It is awesome on a wheat piece of toast topped with a cut banana.  I will buy again. TL;DR Yum!"
Very fresh and tender. Had a nice texture and flavor. Eat within the first week of opening or it gets stale. TL;DR Golden Valley Beef Jerky
I bought 4 11.5oz cans of this on sale for 50 cents each.  It has worst taste of any energy drink I've had kind of more like a carrot taste rather than orange maybe carrot and cauliflower mixed with aspirin with a hint of robitussen. Not sure if it had any effect at all: went right to sleep after drinking it. TL;DR Tried Orange flavor can FRS tastes like fresh squeezed ass
"I thought these would be the perfect answer. Sadly, I guess the pressure with which my Keurig machine shoots the water through the k-cup is too much for the disposa cup, because every single time I tried it, coffee grounds were spewed up through the tiny hole in the lid of the disposa cup all over the inside of where the k-cup sits in my keurig. And yes, I used them properly.<br /><br />So the issue, at least in my Keurig machine, seems to be with the lids. Some have suggested its a design flaw with the Keurig machine. In either case, these disposa cups were NOT the answer for me.<br /><br />Biggest waste of money ever. I cannot recommend. TL;DR Spews coffee grounds inside Keurig machine K-cup holder and down into my coffee every time!"
"We have used this tea for many years.  It is absolutely delicious.<br />Our family prepares 2 gallons at the time. Over the years we have developed what we consider a better end product and save money in the process.  Bring 2 Gal. of water to boil. Switch off.  Add 1 foil pack (contains 4 large tea bags) and let seep for 50 minutes.  Remove bags. Add sugar or sugar substitute if needed.<br />Refrigerate.  Same recipe for the raspberry tea. Of course you can half this recipe, the end result is the same. TL;DR gourmetnotgourmand"
THIS TOOK 12 DAYS TO GET IT! EXTREMELY SLOW - I HAD TO GO TO THE LOCAL SMELLY GROSS PETCO TO GET DOG FOOD. THE WHOLE POINT OF ORDERING THIS ONLINE WAS SO I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THERE! I PAID FOR REGULAR SHIPPING (7 DAYS- NOT 12!) MY DOG LOVES THIS FOOD OTHERWISE. TL;DR EXTREMELY SLOW SHIPPING

And it has a nice mild chocolate flavor and smell. By it's self, it does have an after taste, that is not pleasant.

The natural Oils in the Millstone Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee, makes them both taste pretty good together, to me. It usually arrives in between 1 to 2 weeks on Free Super Saver Shipping.

We have four dogs ranging in size from medium to large.  All four of our furry friends love Nylabones!  Our largest dog has some stomach issues and our vet recommended Nylabones as a chewy toy/treat that our Golden's tummy could handle.  She loves them and they haven't caused her any tummy troubles.  These are regular stocking stuffers for our pooches. TL;DR Awesome chewy treat
"love this product and so does Rocky, the turtle. He actually follows me around his enclosure when its time to eat now. Took a little bit of time to get here but worth the wait. I've searched my area and theres nowhere around me that carry turtle supplies. I'm happy to finally be able to buy the products that are best for him. Future customer for sure! TL;DR Happy turtle!"
"Like the onion soup base, this product is ho-hum but meets all of the criteria...vegan, low sodium.  I will buy it again because the price is reasonable and it is vegan. TL;DR Vegan"
"I love Lapsang Souchong tea, which is hard to find in retail stores. The online choices are Twinning or this Taylors of Harrogate. I won't pretend to make a ""connoisseur's"" analysis of their relative merits; to me they both taste delicious, even though I do believe this (Taylors of Harrogate) tea to have a more pronounced taste (perhaps -- see below -- because there's more tea per cup???).<br /><br />But let's look at what we're asked to pay... This one is $0.12 per bag while Twinning's is $0.16. Moreover, each Taylors of Harrogate tea bag contains 25% more tea than Twinning's (2.5gr vs 2.00gr), so that an equal-weight Twinning tea bag would have to cost $0.20, or a Twinning-size tea bag of this would only only cost $0.09. So in effect we're asked to pay over twice as much per Twinning tea bag! Now, even if there were a difference between them (and they all come from the very same Chinese makers) and the Twinning were the better-tasting tea (which I dispute), it would still not be twice as good to justify spending the extra cash.<br /><br />Yes, it's a lot of tea to buy at once; but at my rate of consumption it represents about a bit less than eight months' supply, and the shipping is free.<br /><br />Finally, regarding that misguided soul who wrote the single 1-star review complaining about the expiration date... this stuff is bone dry, packed in cellophane. It has no meaningful shelf-life limitation. If I brewed you two cups of this tea, one from a freshly-bought box and another from a box that's 1-3 years past its expiration date, I'm confident that -- in a blind test -- you would not be able to tell the old from the new. TL;DR It's not only good, it's a steal!"
"I normally feed a quality canned food, but I was going away for a week so I was seeking a quality dry food for the cat to eat during this time. I switched the cat over by mixing the old and new foods in increasing ratios for a week prior (this was not a sudden food change). Things seemed alright at first, but after on 100% of this dry food, the cat developed loose, bloody, horrid smelling stools. However, I think this cat may have a fish allergy, so it might be the herring in this food. After switching the cat back to the canned food, the stools went back to being their normal firm and virtually odorless within a couple days. Also the cat seemed to start getting fat eating this dry food, whereas she maintains a fairly normal weight when free fed the quality canned food. TL;DR Gave my cat bloody loose smelly stools"
Good staff. Works well. No problems with my digestion. This gel is better than the power bar gel you get in Europe. TL;DR Good Staff
"I ordered this product thinking it would come in a box. It arrived in a plastic bag from the grocery store.  I was taken aback by the packaging.  A zip lock bag would have made a much better impression.  Whoever you are, rethink how you send your product to customers.  I didn't count to see if there were 100 packets in the sack but it looks like they are all there.  I would not purchase from this seller again. TL;DR horrible packaging"
"Don't get me wrong- I like peanut butter. I like peanuts. I like granola too, but nowadays you have to read the labels to see if what you are getting is really healthy or not.  Many folks think that if the word ""granola"" is on something, it must be healthy for you.<br /><br />Out of curiosity, I compared the nutritional label on these Big Nut Bars, to that on a Reese's Peanut Butter cup:<br /><br />Big Nut Bars:<br /><br />Calories = 220<br />Fat Calories = 110<br />Carbs  = 22g<br />Sugars = 12g<br />Protein = 7g<br /><br />Peanut Butter Cups<br /><br />Calories = 230<br />fat calories = 120<br />Carbs = 23g<br />Sugars = 20g<br />Protein = 4g<br /><br />So you will get more protein from a Big Nut Bar, and there is less sugar in it than a Reese's Peanut Butter cup, but I wouldn't go so far as to say either is healthy!<br /><br />Health issues aside, this bar is a conglomeration of peanut butter, peanuts granola, and what tastes like Rice Crispies. Not sure.<br />It is messy to try and eat (you'll get peanut butter all over your fingers, etc.) but if you like those ingredients, you'll like the taste of this bar.  The picture on the front of the box matches the look of the actual bars really well.<br /><br />Pretty straight forward, but not going to win any health awards. TL;DR Peanutty candy bar disguised as granola?"
"I've been trying different spaghetti sauces and we loved this one so much, I'll be sticking with this one everytime. We like a meat sauce, so I always brown 1/2 pound of some italian sausage to add to the sauce. It's fantastic. TL;DR Delicious Sauce"
This polenta is excellent. As I am northern Italian and eat a lot of polenta I will not purchase polenta made in the US because of 90% of corn products being genetically modified. I certainly recommend this product to anyone. TL;DR Polenta
"The hot chocolate is good. But you just can't beat warming up a cup of milk & using it to make your hot chocolate! But that being said, this is great for a quick cup of cocoa though. TL;DR Hot Chocolate"
"My dogs are small - but big on the inside.  They are very aggressive chewers.  These are high quality chews which take a while to break through.  Once they open the ring, supervise closely.  Our puppy is especially happy with these.  The ring is easy for him to manage, and they are great for his teething.  They do not upset his tummy, either. TL;DR for aggressive chewers"
"I recieved a bag  of these through my pet sitting rewards program. When I first opened the box I thought, hmm.. Ocean fish flavor, that's an odd flavor for dog treats. But I have given them to quite a few of my clients and they all love them! They look really fresh, just like homemade! I would highly recommend them! TL;DR Highly recommended by my pet sitting clients!"
"I was expecting something special, as with taste; but this product didn't deliver to me personally. The salt looks pretty as it is very shinny, and will salt your food, but I will not reorder and go back to the Kosher salt from the dollar store when I run out in 20 years. TL;DR Salt of the earth."
"Not at all like pepper pot soup, it is just a crab soup that has very little flavor and in no way should be called pepper pot. TL;DR If you like Campbells Pepper pot soup then don't buy this!"
I have to agree with the other reviewers! These are excellent and difficult to stop eating! I'm not even that fat and I want to eat the whole box in one sitting! What a great jerky snack! TL;DR Ostritch and My Tummy Are Friends
"A glass bottle would have been better, it looked like glass in the photo, I didn't pay close enough attention. I usually avoid plastic AMAP especially after going to the expense of buying organic! I do not use molasses THAT much so I am not a good judge of the quality.  I figure organic is the safest way to go.  I use it mostly to make brown sugar (regular sugar + molasses = brown sugar.....I don't even mix it, just put both in my recipe....careful, a little goes a long ways!) TL;DR almost"
I sent several boxes out for Christmas presents and it's one of the only years I ever gotten feedback about my gifts. Everyone I sent it to loved it and reminisced about candy they used to buy when they were a kid. My aunt even said she took a picture of she and her friend wearing the wax lips.  We're talking about two people in their sixties! So it was definitely a big hit. TL;DR Everyone loves this gift
"My baby LOVES sweet potatoes. I can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them; which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what I wanted to mix in there... it was horribly runny, like spooning formula into his mouth. Ick. TL;DR Too runny..."
"Right out of my childhood, I love this stuff.  I've never been able to recreate the flavors in that spice packet.  The pasta is only OK, but the spice blend is out of this world.<br /><br />I can't find it anyplace in the SF Bay Area (Kraft says it's not sold within 25 miles of here), but it was a staple in the Midwest.  Thanks to Amazon for hooking me up. TL;DR I love this stuff - Hi Mom!"
My kitten loves the food and it was here before we knew it! It does take a little bit to prepare the food but it is well worth it. TL;DR Great product and fast delivery!
I was looking for low carb snacks.  For some reason grocery stores in my area don't carry pickled polish sausages any more.  They are not too hot and are tasty besides.  This was a great find! TL;DR Great low carb snack!
"This name was pretty embarrassing but they have now changed it to ""neuro passion"". just to let you all know :) TL;DR Name change"
"For anyone who has ever tried ginger beer, this product really packs a punch! It reminded me of ginger beer from the islands - it has that authentic, smooth, ginger burn that you expect from real ginger beer. Totally none alcoholic and thankfully not a soda. Much more refreshing with the right amount of ginger bite. There is actual ginger floating at the bottom of the bottle so you have to shake it up before you drink the beverage...outstanding! I love the 6.8 oz glass bottles-just the right amount to quench a thirst but not too much so you don't have leftovers that go flat...smart thinking. I am a huge fan of ginger beer and I give Fever-Tree Premium a 5+. Drink up ginger beer lovers. Thank you FEVER-TREE.<br /><br />J TL;DR Fever-Tree Ginger Beer ROCKS!!!!"
"Some mint teas are overwhelming but Stash's Morocan Mint is just mildly minty. It is made with spearmint, lemongrass, peppermint and green tea. I don't really taste anything too lemony. This has a smooth, refreshing taste that you can enjoy every day or when you are tired of tea with milk. I like this tea with one packet of stevia. It would also be great with honey. If you don't think this is strong enough use two tea bags like I do.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review TL;DR Mildly Minty"
This product is deliciuos and versatile.  It can be used in many appetizing ways. TL;DR fantastic
Smart way to sell High Fructose Corn Syrup & Corn Syrup - Flavor it with apple and charge the same as for real apple sauce. TL;DR High Fructose Corn Syrup & Corn Syrup with a touch of apple
"The cereals had a weird odour and also the colour is a slight tinge of greenish/greyish. Even though, the tins were originally sealed and expiry date is in 2012!<br /><br />Is there a production problem for the cereals? Perhaps amazon.com should do a sample check!<br /><br />This is a serious problem and should be investigated immediately as the cereals are meant for our dear babies! TL;DR Production Problem?!"
"I always keep a box of these in my briefcase when I go to meetings. Just one will freshen my breath without an overwhelming mint smell. Plus each one literally has just less than two calories.<br /><br />I like the big pack size, which is 1 oz compared to 1/2 oz for the smaller size, though the actual size of the tic tacs is the same in each.<br /><br />I don't use these often enough to buy a 12 pack. Plus the current price on Amazon with shipping is about what I pay for these packs individually when I buy them in my local supermarket. In fact these are widely available in supermarkets and drugstores, usually at the checkout register.<br /><br />Bottom line: These work well, but the current price on Amazon is no bargain. TL;DR Great for fresh breath"
I like the taste of the oil.  It has a dark glass bottle to protect the oil form light.  The oil should not be refrigerated. TL;DR Eden organic extra virgin olive oil
"This is a great tasting Ginger Beer, very full flavored and strong as it should be. Children will not like this soda, but grownups will, well if you like ginger. Also makes a good mixer for adult drinks. TL;DR Good Ginger Beer"
"I am a tea snob, I will freely admit it. But this is some of the best tea I've ever had, and it's so inexpensive. I purchase this regularly for myself as well as for gifts. I usually leave a box to share at work, and it goes very quickly (so I have to hide a little stash of tea for myself to make sure I get some too!) TL;DR Delicious"
this is the best cat food but Whiskas changed their Meaty Selection just recently to a smaller flatter kibble - my cat just walks away from it - that's why I was so happy to find this on Amazon-I bought two big bags - nothing makes a cat owner happier than the sound of lots of crunching at the food dish!!! thanks for still carrying it. I wrote to Whiskas and told them they shouldn't mess with a good thing! TL;DR whiskas dry food
"if there were a ""zero"" rating that's what I'd give it! Expensive and tastes awful!  Do not buy this soup.  Wasted money. TL;DR awful!"
"I don't know if the previous individual had a bad bag, but I have bought these for a year now as they are the only treat my cat never tires of. He loves them and would eat bags of them all at once if he had access. They have always been perfectly soft for him, while remaining in solid chunks in the bag, waiting to be eaten. TL;DR My cat loves these...can't get enough."
"I bought these to fill the Busy Budy Puppy Waddle Treat Dog Toy.  I have to say my Pomeranian puppy LOVES the taste of them, but they are almost too small for the toy and the fall out without him even having to work for them.  I wish they were a little bigger, but I still use them.  Also, a ton come in the bag, so they should last a while. TL;DR Tasty..but really tiny."
The flavorful little candy shapes are addictive to me! I plan to buy another 5 lb bag very soon because I keep buying out the stores around my area. TL;DR Great Fruity Treat
Ferrara Pan Candy Company is the only Atomics I know and they have been around since the beginning of time. They are consistent in quality.<br /><br />I buy a bag each week for people a t work. Some people just live on these animals. Others just see how long they can suck on them before changing to the other side of the mouth. It looks like people are going around with fat jaws. When the red coating wears off it seems that they just get hotter. And you can hear the tell tale sound of people crunching to get it over with. Then they come back for more. TL;DR Try these little hotties
"This is one of the best brands of instant cider mix.  Great to have it available via Amazon, as most stores no longer carry the brand. TL;DR GREAT TO HAVE"
"I learned about this true Thai coconut milk from my favorite Thai restaurant.  It is absolutely the best coconut milk on the market.  My only wish is that their cans were BPA free - other than that, it's perfect!  Please AMAZON make it one of your products so I get FREE shipping! TL;DR Hands down the BEST!"
"I had purchased a good chipotle sauce and couldn't find it again, so I found this stuff to try...definitely not a fan, it's just not good in a sandwich. TL;DR Not good"
"As other reviewers have said, these are not thick and dense like real bully sticks. they're sort of hollow. Not a total waste, as the pup still loves them, but WAY too expensive for what you get.<br /><br />NOT recommended, except maybe at 1/2 the price I paid. TL;DR NOT bully sticks"
"I was never a fan of sardines, too strong, fishy and salty. My huband bought that awful stuff at the grocery store that even the cats wouldn't eat. But I wanted to start eating healthier foods and sardines seemed like a simple, mega-3-rich, quick and healthy snack. Seasons had great reviews so I took a chance. These arrived today and I am already addicted. The easy open container comes packed with 4 good sized fish in a light olive oil. The fish have a very delicate flavor as well as aroma and minimal saltiness. Thanks Seasons! TL;DR Delicious"
"LOVE these things. Open it, pour milk or water in it, Microwave it and lunch is done. I spice them up a bit but they really don't need it but you can make a meal from these by adding chickien, shrimp or meatballs and not really cook at al. The price is a bit steep with the shipping but they don't always have what I want at the store so by the time I pay tax it's about the same price but at least I can get what I want all the time. I love these. I don't consider it a side for me but a whole meal. Feeding a family it would be a great side with noodles the kids would eat and carbs everyone needs. TL;DR packaged meals"
"This is an awesome quality saffron and great price for the quantity. totally satisfied with the purchase, and will be ordering more in the future. TL;DR It s one of the best saffron"
"Awesome product for being out and about with your baby. Also bought the boon spoon set and it fits nicely for feeding small babies.  Great for keeping one hand open at restaurants, so you can eat yourself as well. TL;DR Excellant for being out"
"I'm not sure that this gum improved my well-being or any of those other sorts of claims, but it was tasty and pleasant to chew, which is pretty much all I ask of my chewing gum anyway.  This gum has a good peppermint flavor, though not too strong.  I don't really taste the ginger, but I suspect that's what tempers the peppermint.  The texture is quite soft; softer, I'd say, than other chewing gums, which I found pleasant.  This gum kept it's flavor well.  Can't really ask for more than that. TL;DR Good Stuff"
"If you drink ""pod"" espresso, I think this product offers very good taste and value for the price. TL;DR Very good value for the price."
Just as described.  Good product.  Needs to be added to iced tea or at least 8 oz of water if you don't like strong tea taste.  It's  a good way to get your antioxidants daily. TL;DR Organic Green Tea Extract
"I'd never had these olives before and thought I'd give them a try.  I find them to be softer than I prefer, and definitely much saltier.  If you're planning on cooking with these (or putting them in a pasta as I am), you don't need to add any salt to your dish.  The container is great though!<br /><br />The container is labelled:  Refrigerate after opening.  I hadn't planned on refrigerating these, but perhaps I should.  Anyhow, if you're ordering them, make room in your fridge for a container about the size of a pickle jar from the bulk foods section.<br /><br />As far as flavor... try to imagine your standard green (Spanish) pimento-stuffed olive but using a a black olive.  These are not mild - very strong vinegar flavor. TL;DR Soft"
I am currently experimenting with a lower carb higher protein bread. I have already learned not to use too much soy flour or that is all you will taste. Other than that its great to thicken sauces or gravies. TL;DR good soy flour
It's hard to find good tasting tea that is also affordable. I hope Amazon continues to carry this brand. I'm very happy with the taste and the value. TL;DR Great tasting!
I used to buy this stuff from Fred Meyer but then I moved to the east where this is unavailable.  I tried just about every granola that can be bought locally before discovering that I can buy this on Amazon.  I wouldn't be ordering my breakfast through the mail unless it was that good! TL;DR Best granola I've had
"This must be the BEST dried Cherries out there in the market. It's juicy and not too sweet.<br />For 4 Pounds I thought I should get a big box but not quite.  Because of weight of the dried cherries quite heavey, box size just a little bit bigger than a letter size paper. TL;DR WoW~"
"Maybe my expectations were too high. Heeding the warnings about adding too much I started with 8 oz of bottled seltzer and added a few drops. The taste was more of a hint than a true flavoring so I added a little more, figuring if I got the taste I liked I'd start from scratch and get a better measurement. It never happened for me. When I added enough to create some flavor I also found an aftertaste that was somewhat alcohol-y. Not a problem for most people but I strongly dislike the taste of alcohol so it's not good for me. Played with it some more and never got a satisfactory result. Into the fridge, back of the shelf.<br /><br />A couple of weeks later I came home with some diet orange soda. Thought I'd try it again and see if I could make some orange cream soda and voila! Delicious. I say this having only tried one 8 oz serving and I made it a little too sweet but I have no doubt that once I get the ratio correct I'll add this to any orange soda I drink from now on. I'll probably try it with other flavors too altho orange seems to be the sure thing. TL;DR Good but..."
These are the best gluten and dairy free cookies out there. They are better then many cookies with gluten and dairy. I highly recommend them. My whole family loves them! They are very sweet and chocolaty. TL;DR The greatest cookies.
These are certainly an acquired taste.  The most interesting thing to happen is when a cuban friend came over and was so taken with the aroma.  that is because they use lavender on babies.  he was the only one to try one and finish it.  my son and i like them for the refreshing taste they give to you.  they help cleanse the palate. TL;DR You'll either love em or hate em
"I'm not usually a green tea fan, but I adore lemon ginger, so when Stash came up with this tea, I sampled it & decided to order in quantity! Good stuff, & thanks to Amazon for making it available this way. TL;DR Most Excellent Tea!"
"These are super fabulous. I actually crave them! These are not your average ""broke food"" ramen. The flavor and spice are terrific. They are not too spicy so that you can actually enjoy the flavor too. The dried veggies are great too. If you want to be authentic crack an egg into it while it is still cooking. My husband who did two tours in Korea adds cheese to his- I find that kinda gross but if that's what the Koreans do then why not. I have never been to Korea , but eating these ramen make me feel like I can at least have a taste of it ! TL;DR My nieghbors from Guam turned me onto these"
The fruit bits are very tasty and have a nice variety of fruits. What I find nice is that I do not have to chop them up when I use in an oatmeal cookie recipe. TL;DR Sun-Maid Fruit Bits
"These Veal Patties are great!!. They are good if you just want a sandwich or want to make Veal Parmegian.<br />True its not like making it from scratch, but it is very tasty and consistant.<br />I love them,. TL;DR YUMMIE VEAL PATTIES"
This is the first Gluten Free mix I have used.  Not allergic to Gluten but trying to cut down on our intake.  They turned out very well.  Nice and fluffy with a dark golden color.  Plus the ingredients are NON-GMO.  Kids couldn't tell the difference between this and our usual Bob's Red Mill.<br /><br />Update to original review.<br />We tried this again and I am surprised at how much it makes.  A great value!  Plus it is whole grain.  Will definitely purchase in the future! TL;DR Very good.
Will not fall apart if cooked to directions. So good. You will be saying this has to have gluten. But the great part is has none. TL;DR tastes real!
"This is what it says it is and works just like all other corn starch.  You may be able to get cornstarch at the store a little cheaper, but the convenience is good. TL;DR Met expectations"
"The product arrived quickly and in good condition.<br /><br />I will probably order this way again because it was easier than going to the pet food store with no concern the product might be out of stock when I arrived. TL;DR Easy, no hassle"
This is a nice full flavored coffee.  We like strong coffee without bitterness.  You may have to play a little with the amount of coffee you use to brew with to get the flavor you like.  If you use too much coffee it is slightly bitter. TL;DR Melitta European Roast Coffee
"I've been waiting for this variety to come to Amazon, since purchasing a box locally (and paying a pretty penny...$4 a box!) and really enjoying it.<br /><br />Don't let the ""cocoa"" in the description mislead you...this doesn't taste like hot chocolate. The cocoa flavor is really subtle, and it gives this tea a really full, rich taste. I am usually a coffee drinker, but I think I could switch for this tea. I take it with some milk and sugar. Highly recommended. TL;DR Full bodied taste, perfect spices"
Very delicious! My family all Love this.No other ingredients except cashew and sea salt. Nice choice! Fresh and tasty.Nice snacks TL;DR NICE ONE.
"I am hooked on Bob's Red Mill Chia seeds for my breakfast  cereals.  Great with oatmeal and with granola.  Not sure where to buy product  going forward, since you are no longer carrying product. TL;DR Chia Seeds"
"They must be good. My dog loves these snacks. The ingredients are all healty. Quick and easy to get to in their easy open jar. The jar even has a neat handle that can help if you make the top too tight.No plastic bag here. I find the plastic bags a real pain to keep the little balls fresh. I suppose once you by a jar you could always buy the bags as a refill. There is no price difference in cost though, so why bother.<br /><br />The only thing my little girlie seems to enjoy more are the chicken fillets. These are quick and she seems to enjoy the texture as a change. TL;DR They must be great!"
"My dog loves these, but the bag arrived with a large slice across it. I don't love that they are made in China but this is the only rawhide she will eat. TL;DR Bag was open"
"We love to use real cacao powder for it's health benefits.  Nativa's is the brand we always buy because it's always great.  I've tried other brands and keep coming back to Nativa's because of the quality, taste, and price.  Amazon has the best price. TL;DR Raw Cacao"
It took me a long time to find this low-sugar kids drink. My two-year old loves it. Will definitely buy again. TL;DR My daughter loves it!
"I LOVE this product - all four of my boys (ages 2, 4, 7 and 9) love it as much as I do.  we put it on mac n cheese, salads, pasta, you name it, we shake it! TL;DR Delicious!"
I enjoy this product because it add so much flavour to your food. you can use it on just about everything when it comes to food of course and it makes it.........lets just say you would have to have seconds. My sister recommend this to me one day and I have been using it for years now and never choose anything else but this. TL;DR flavour
"This is the smoothest and best tasting Keurig coffee I've tried.  It's not bitter, not too weak, not too strong, just right! TL;DR Yum Yum"
This whole seed mustard is hot like a French Dijon.  Great for sandwiches! TL;DR Great Hot Mustard
"I bought my first box of OXO lamb stock cubes in Saudi Arabia two years ago.  Have used them up and can't find them in any local store.  They are excellent, as are the beef cubes which a friend uses to make a yummy salad dressing. TL;DR Essential for arab cooking"
While having the twinning earl grey flavor decided to write the review as I felt it deserved one.Great stuff.Better than the other brands I have tried so far.Does a better job than Tazo awake to make you feel fresh.Will certainly order more... TL;DR Pretty nice aroma & refreshing
We have a professional espresso machine and would never use another type of coffee. Try this and you will not be sorry. TL;DR Best Italian Coffee
"I instantly fell in love after taking a teabag from the box. Right away the scent hits you and just makes you think this tea will be very spicey and sharp.<br />Once it's made, it seems to have a warm ""fresh baked"" flavor to it but still a very strong (pleasant) ginger-spice flavor. Just make sure you only steep it UP to 5 mins. (I find that Sugar Cookie Sleigh ride can be steeped as long as you want, and only gets better. This one can get a bit too strong very quick.<br /><br />I was afraid to try it for the longest time, since I'm not a HUGE fan of gingerbread, but wow. I just ordered 6 more boxes and will keep it in my house forever!<br /><br />If you like spice teas, or even warm ""cinnamon"" type teas, Please give this one a chance!<br /><br />The only con to it is that I have never seen it in a store, even very hard to find around Christmas. TL;DR Best Tea I have ever had"
"We have been Iams and Science Diet fans for the four years of our dog's life, but decided to give this a try when he started being finicky about flavors. He cleans the bowl in about 10 seconds. Our other tiny dog also likes this as much as the super expensive stuff made for ""royalty."" Neither had stomach issues with the change over and they will work for it like a treat. If you are looking for something a notch up form junk dog food, but priced reasonably give the Chef Michael's a try. It even smells good to us! TL;DR My picky dog will eat this"
"This product was unsatisfactory. Every time I used one of the Timothy's Kcups, I ended up with a cup full of coffee grounds. We have used hundreds of Kcups and this is the only time this has happened. Not sure if it was defective shipment or what. Have 1+ boxes left due to problem. Would be afraid to order again. TL;DR Timothys Decaf Kcups"
"It is not clear how many bottles you get with this purchase? 2 bottles? 12? This is a a wonderful juice though, and I hope it is more than 2 bottles! TL;DR Question"
"Albanese gummi bears are the best in the world! I would highly recommend this product. They are delicious, reasonably priced and ship quickly. My kids all like the Albanese gummis the best!!! If you have a favorite flavor, you can also order just that flavor, which is a big hit at our house. TL;DR The best Gummis in the world"
"I'm a big fan of Ribena, having discovered it on a trip to Ireland. I was really excited to see that it was available on Amazon. If you like black currant juice, this is the stuff to buy. TL;DR Great juice"
"I had high hopes for this product when I purchased it since everyone was singing its praises.  Some background on me; I don't eat gluten or dairy of any kind.  I have food sensitivities so I'm used to eating things that don't taste great.  I watch my weight and love peanut butter so I thought this would be perfect for me.  I first tried it mixed with a little water like the instructions said.  It was horrible and I didn't eat it.  Next I made the peanut butter cookies on the PB2 website.  They were not good.  I could barely eat one.  I shared it with my dog and she liked it.  Maybe if you make your own dog treats it would work for that.  Lastly, I tried it in my morning protein drink and it was fine.  I may add it from time to time to have some extra protein.  This is the only way I will use it.  I can't believe so many people liked it. TL;DR Not good"
"I tried this coffee, even though it was significantly more expensive than the Green Mountain (organic, free trade) Sumatra that I have been using for some time. Wolfgang Puck has the name and the rep.<br /><br />If this were the only Sumatra dark roast on the market, I'd be really happy with it. This is good coffee.<br /><br />It is not outstanding coffee. Compared to Folgers, this product is awesome. Unfortunately for Mr. Puck, I am comparing it to Green Mountain Sumatra.<br /><br />The organic and free trade Sumatra from Green Mountain is better to my taste, and it is cheaper. Mornings are good. TL;DR Good but not a premium coffee"
We purchased this extract for flavoing a chocolate candy that we produce and it is perfect! It is very strong so we aren't having to pour an entire bottle of flavoring in to taste it. It also smells great! The Rose flavoring is very unique and adds a twist to anything that you add it to. We have customers who LOVE any of our products with this flavoring added. TL;DR Pleasant!
"The packaging is very deluxe and they arrived unharmed.  The cups are solid chocolate and very well constructed.  The variety is interesting.  However, I found the candy to be on the oil-rich side as apposed to creamy.  One or two and you don't really object.  I bought these on sale and would not have bought them at the suggested retail.  For what I paid, I am pleased enough. TL;DR Very fancy"
A neighbor made this soup mix for us and brought it over.  She added pre-made chicken and a bag of frozen vegetables.  It was the best chicken noodle soup we have ever had. She said it was easy to make and such a nice gift for us! TL;DR Great Soup Mix
"My cat allergic to any food. I tried to cook for him, to buy can food, he even refuse to eat treats.<br />Royal canin is the only food that he would eat without any allergic reaction.<br />Make sure you change water at least once a day and your cat drinks planty of it. TL;DR Cat loves it"
"I bought a box of this tea at my local Whole Foods.  If you have never tried this tea, I recommend buying one box, like I did, rather than buying it in bulk here on Amazon.  I am not pregnant, but I heard this tea had good benefits for all women of reproductive age (I'm in my late 20's).  So I made a large cup of this tea and went on with my day.  Within two hours of ingesting the tea, I had MAJOR uterine cramps.  Now, I guess this might be what they euphemistically refer to as ""strengthening the female system"".  I cannot imagine drinking this when I was 6 weeks pregnant, as it seems to basically cause contractions in me after one cup.  I guess it will be useful at the end of the third trimester, especially if I'm past term.  But for every day use, I don't like it.  It's like having period cramps every day.  Ugh. TL;DR Not for Everyone!"
"I purchased this in a B&M store but wanted to add a review on amazon for this tea.  It's excellent.  Wonderful tea flavor, great black tea flavor, it's not overly fruity or very sweet, it has just the right balance of a fruit/black tea.  The tea pyramids never lose their shape.  It's great iced.  It has real pieces of fruit and big tea leaves inside the pyramids.  Definitely one of the best teas I've ever drank (but the very the best teas are very expensive hand-picked leaves ordered from specialist tea websites and brewed by spoon-full.) TL;DR Excellent Fruit Tea"
"And by haunt you, I mean in the form of vomit all over the place. Though my dog, a 150lb. Newfoundland, absolutely loved the bone but even after just a few minutes chewing it, he had managed to gnaw off some bone slivers and swallowed them. Shortly after that he was throwing up, not just the bone slivers, but everything he had eaten for what seemed like days. So, while it seemed great to give him a treat that he loved so thoroughly, the aftermath just wasn't worth it. TL;DR It'll come back to haunt you"
"I know it may sound strange, but I use a tablespoon of this almond meal mixed with water as a facial cleanser and mask, and ever since the first use of this paste, the quality of my skin has HUGELY improved. I honestly wish I had pictures to share, because my acne has been reduced in half within a single month. I have tried literally hundreds of different skin care products and homemade remedies, and this is definitely a thoroughly effective mild exfoliant, cleanser, and mask for acneic skin. TL;DR MARVELOUS as a facial cleanser and mask!"
I tried this product only because I couldn't get the one I'm used to and found it to be harder to use in my baking since I was making cookies.  It probably is better for cakes. TL;DR Pretty good baking
"received this product thinking it would be a good deal.  opened one up, they have very little salt on them and taste stale.....would never buy again TL;DR stale"
"I have insulin resistance so I need a snack that is low in bad carbs but can provide a good source of energy at the same time. So, I've spent a long time trying to find the right snack and I have finally found the best granola bar ever! Kashi's bars do not taste like cardboard and their texture is so much better than any other health/protein bar I've ever tried. The flavors are fantastic and I'm officially addicted to them, especially the chocolate & peanut bar. I personally love everything that Kashi makes but these granola bars are a real find!! I think I'm gonna go have one right now... TL;DR The Best Granola Bars Ever!!!"
"...in that it's chewy, beefy, and has a long shelf life. Jack Link's Peppered jerky is a tad too peppery for my liking, so I expected the teriyaki flavor to be just as robust. Instead, it is mild. Still really good, however! One word of caution, although it's addictive, eat in moderation, or your sodium levels will be off the chart. TL;DR Has most of what you want in a Jerky..."
I decided to try these noodles with pesto sauce. They were great! They are whole grain buckwheat which is supposed to be nutritious and they taste good. I will use them instead of other pastas whenever I can. TL;DR Great noodles in 3.5-4 minutes!
"I need to eat 1 or 2 protein bars every day as a post bariatric surgery patient to ensure that I get enough protein every day. This double-chocolate Special K protein bar (10g protein, 180 cal), is my very favorite protein bar, since it tastes more like a chocolate candy bar with crunch. I've been eating 4-5 per week for over a year and I still don't get tired of them. There may be bars with more protein, or ones with more fiber. but none with better taste in my opinion. Buy one box and you'll be hooked. TL;DR BEST tasting protein bar!!!"
"My dog is a very picky eater.  She refuses to eat certain dry foods, but she really likes Purina Beneful. I have given her Pedigree for years and she will eat it sometimes, but she doesn't seem to enjoy it.  I was actually shocked by the way she went at Beneful the first time I gave it to her. The bag is more than halfway gone and she still seems to really enjoy it. I guess she has chosen to switch to Purina Beneful. TL;DR My dog likes it"
"Beacuase of its crunchiness, you can't get enough. Unfortuneately its made from horseradish and food coloring. True wasabi almost tatses like spicy pungent mint. I still like the crunch it packs and enjoy my sinuses being drained out. TL;DR Not real wasabi.."
I use this in so many different things! Mostly tea or making my own coffee drinks at home. There are a ton of recipes on the Torani website. Buy this once and you'll be addicted!! TL;DR Yum!!
Hard to find in retail stores. Easiest way to get this<br />coffee is amazon. Coffee is fresh and the same I used<br />to buy in Chicago suburb. TL;DR love orange seville coffee
"I absolutely love this granola! It is both delicious and healthy. With 33 grams of Whole Grains, 4 grams of fiber, and 5 grams of protein in each 1/2 cup serving, it packs a nutritional powerhouse with a fantastic flavor! I like it best after a workout with a 1/2 cup of milk and banana chopped up in it. I can't wait to try the other flavors. I'm sure they will be equally as delicious! TL;DR Best Granola!"
"I recently found out that I was allergic to Wheat, Gluten and Milk and I love baking, so I was very excited when i found Pamela's Chocolate chip cookie mix. My friends didn't even notice the difference! This is a wonderful mix so good and easy. I highly recommend this mix! TL;DR This cookie mix is amazing"
This is a pretty good dog food if you are looking for grain free formula. Our dog didn't have any issue transferring to this food. Canidae overall is a good brand for dog food. If you are looking for a decently priced grain free formula this might be worth a try. TL;DR Canidae ALS Grain Free Dog Food
"I bought three boxes of this. The first package I made, the cupcakes fell in the center and I followed the directions exactly. I chalked it up to a fluke and a few months later made another box. They didn't fall this time, but the consistency was just not right...crunchy. I threw the third box away and won't buy again. Keep in mind, I usually make things from scratch and am an experienced baker so I don't think the error was on my end, maybe the packages were old. TL;DR this sucks"
This spice is great. I found that it not only makes my rotisserie chicken taste wonderfull it also works on pork ribs. I made chicken and dumplings the other day and added some of this spice and it made it taste great. Feel free to try it in many recipes :) TL;DR Not just for chicken
The product is very good.  I cannot find these in any store around here and I am addicted to them.  The price was a little high but there was no shipping.  Took a little long to get them but when shipping is free you have to expect that.  I would order again. TL;DR good as always
"This is a good idea and inexpensive, too.  We love our Tassimo machine and find this carousel to be very handy! TL;DR good idea"
"It has the fattiness but not the flavor of chicken soup. Nothing exciting, but it did have a small positive effect on the mushroom barley soup. TL;DR It's OK"
"The product description currently states that these nuts have ""a hint of pepper.""  Don't you believe it.  There's at least as much pepper on these as there is salt, and there's too much of both.  I can't taste anything but the pepper when I eat them, and they're so salty that I'm thirsty afterwards.  This is a terrible product, and the company needs to seriously scale back their seasonings. TL;DR Like a mouthful of pepper"
"Title says it all. Before I became a vegetarian, used to love jerky. :( This was the best! TL;DR It's jerky, how can you go wrong!"
"I have subscribed to VITA COCO, since there was offer, thought of trying it. Just bought the ONE Coconut water with organic label on it. It is horrible to taste and not comparable to VITA COCO. we cannot even return as per the AMAZON policy with groceries. My sincere advice is don't waste money on this TL;DR horrible taste, not comparable to VITA COCO"
"This gum is great!  It has all the great flavor and texture of a sugar-free gum without all the artificial colors, artificial flavors, or artificial sweetners.  Finally a gum I can feel good about chewing! TL;DR Great gum AND all natural!"
"I ordered Once Again almond butter because I needed to stop eating peanut butter and decided to try almonds.  Its awesome. Its a little soupy but once its refrigerated its perfect. It sticks to the roof of your mouth just like peanut butter but tastes so much better. No salt, no sugar, no transfat. TL;DR Yummy"
Pretty dam good. Much better than any other high fiber cereals out there. Perfect for a low carb dieter like myself. TL;DR Dam good.
I had never heard of Walker's biscuits before and I was really surprised how good they were.  The ginger cookies had pieces of ginger in them - delicious and the chocolate biscuits were different and tasted great.  The honey oat biscuits were also very good.  I would like to order them separately. TL;DR Great cookies
"I was very surprised to read negative reviews of the NuGo FREE Carrot Cake Bars, because I like them so much! I love cinnamon and am always on the lookout for soy-free, dairy-free, gluten-free options. There really aren't many -- and these are my current faves, along with the Nude Food Pineapple Pomegranate Walnut Bars. TL;DR GF SF DF -- and yummy!"
"Great Mate! I like the flavor. I drink it every morning. Thank you for the fast shipping, and I will be buying from you again. So far I have recently opened up the second bag. I like buying these larger bulk orders from you. TL;DR Rosamonte Yerba Mate (6.6 lbs"
"What am I missing?<br /><br />This mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake. I've tried adding vanilla and cinnamon. I use real maple syrup on top. I cook them in fresh bacon grease. The pancakes are still, just, blah. It's like they absorb and negate the flavors.<br /><br />The pancakes cook ok. The texture is fine. Just absolutely no flavor.<br /><br />Won't get this again. Considering pitching the rest of what I have. TL;DR Confused..."
"Used as part of a teeth-cleaning routine for our dog, along with two other brands of dental chewies used to keep her interested.  So far (she is over 8 years old) her teeth are in great shape. TL;DR Good part of doggie dental hygiene - good price at Amazon"
BUYER BEWARE:<br /><br />This is NOT edible baby parts.<br />It is ACTUAL food.<br /><br />How disappointing... TL;DR sadly...
"Reading some of the other reviews here, I do not agree with some of them calling these bars ""dry"". Maybe they got a bad batch? Though not overly moist, I did not find them dry at all. They were especialy good with a cup of coffee. They have a different taste, but not a weird one. The cocoa  is the main thing you will notice, but the walnuts and raisins come through as well. The makers of this bar seemed to have found the right combination of these ingrediants to make one delicious snack bar. TL;DR Different and delicious"
"At 6.8 ounces this drink size is a tad on the small size. It's a very thin coffee drink that to me is ""just okay"". At about $2 each it also seems a tad on the expensive side. The flavor is good, so it's worth a try to see if it ""hits the spot"" for you. TL;DR Quick coffee drink"
"This is an excellent pasta product.<br />Cooks up nice and starchy so the sauce clings to each noodle.  The pasta water thickens tomato sauces nicely.<br />Taste great, nice color.  Makes a delicious Mac and cheese, the noodle shape enhances the dish.<br />My favorite pasta brand.<br /><br />Made in Italy. TL;DR Excellent"
"It tasted good, but was not as soft as some I had tasted on a friend's home.  I'd like the packages to be smaller in size. TL;DR licorice from Australia"
"I'm a ""soft cookie"" fan, and these cookies fit the bill. They're nice and chewy. Best of all, they're super chocolately! They're not very big, but that's okay because the flavor is so rich. I couldn't eat a lot at a time, but for a decadent snack, these are perfect. My kids loved them, too. If you like soft, chewy cookies and chocolate, you won't be disappointed in the Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies. TL;DR Decadent!"
"The Crispy Brown Rice Cereal with Mixed Berries isn't too bad!  I would say it is pretty similar to regular (non-gluten free) Rice Krispies in that it gets soggy in milk pretty quickly but, it is pretty yummy as long as you eat it right after you add the milk.  I made ""rice krispy treats"" with them & they were good.  The berries added a little something extra to it.  Even people who don't need to eat gluten-free said they were good. TL;DR Not too bad!"
Was pleased as to receiving<br />my favorite tea. It arrived<br />without much delay as do<br />most products that I order<br />from Amazon. TL;DR the best green tea
"Love this coffee BUT I wish the flavor was just a tad bit more.It's a definite keeper in my supply, it does have a good taste with no bitterness it just needs a bit more blueberry flavor. TL;DR Love it!!!!"
"The flavour and smell is very strong, unlike any other seeds I've tried. I would describe the smell/taste as a spicy, maybe a little acidic. I don't know where the spiciness comes from, it is really strong and really unlike anything I've ever had. I would not describe the taste as earthy, earthy tasting to me is like a tea that tastes like leaves, but it is possible that this flavor is earthy to others. If you are using many at a time just be aware they are strong.<br /><br />They are packaged tightly, which is convenient for storage. Flat, vacuum-sealed? bags which can be slid in just about anywhere.<br /><br />**Edit**<br />Have to change my review from 4 to two stars.<br />I had some pasta the other day and the (red) sauce tasted exactly like these poppy seeds. Today I opened a bag and noticed little red  or orange flecks. It look like there is something added to these, which would describe the strange smell, which is not natural.<br /><br />I rinsed them, but they rinsed *very clean so it it's not an oily residue that is causing this, which they haven't (rinsed clean) in the past.<br />I am not sure what is going on, but I personally, will not be using these anymore - this whole thing is just freaking me out. TL;DR Strong smell/flavour."
"Saw an episode on Artichoke Tea on Cholesterole. It has actually helped, but the teas I have tried did not taste very good until I came across this one. It has a apple berry flavor which is great, now it is easy to finish my cup. Even drink more than one a day now because it taste pretty good. TL;DR Best Tasting Artichoke Tea I have come across"
"If you like all flavors of jelly beans and then some, these are for you.  Great by the handful! TL;DR Kirkland Signature Jelly Beans 49 Flavors"
"If you've never had a BCalm before, you've gotta try it.  It's really the perfect drink for relaxation.  Good for a stressful day in the office, a day at the beach, or pretty much anywhere you are.  As a commercial director, I'm on set all the time.  And while coffee is great early in the morning, there's really nothing better than a BCalm (or two) in the afternoon.  Keeps me going, while putting me at ease.  Definitely give it a shot! TL;DR Love It!"
"My dad picked some of this up from a produce stand while he was out of state. I was at his house visiting, and he had me try a bit on a Ritz cracker. I wasn't so sure I wanted to try it due to the thick waxy looking appearance. It just wasn't what I knew as honey. Once I had one, I had another, and another. This stuff is amazing. I have found myself craving it, but unable to find it any local markets or stores. The waxy appearance is actually a hint at the super creamy texture, and the flavor is so yummy. I am excited to have finally found it, same brand and everything. There are so many ways I want to try this beyond smearing it on a cracker. TL;DR Dang it dad..."
"This is simply delicious. High quality, tender, yummy without even adding anything to it. Exceptional product. Keep it in stock Amazon. This is a winner. TL;DR Terrific taste and quality"
"Not as fresh as I expected, tasted as if was kicking around a few days TL;DR not fresh"
"I stopped using this product and switched to a less expensive alternative, after 2 recalls from the other food manufacturer I am back to using Blue Buffalo which seems to do pretty good with food manufacturing and avoiding contamination. I guess you get what you pay for, cheaper options seem to lack current good manufacturing practices to ensure a high quality product. I work with an organization that deals with cGMP for manufacturing processes every day, so I'm not bad at recognizing a serious manufacturer following cGMP. I'm paying a little more but I care about my dogs so I don't mind. TL;DR Excellent food, had to switch back to it"
"I thought these bags would have more candy than they did so, I'm a little disappointed in this bag. However, the delivery was everything you could ask for. I wish there would have been a bag count. TL;DR Not so much candy!!"
"My daughter likes these puffs but cheerios are a much better option because they don't have as much sugar  and are much more affordable, these are terribly overpriced. TL;DR lots of sugar and a bit too expensive."
My daughters have been addicted to Starbucks for a while but I am not a coffee drinker.  I do however love chai tea.  I have a dairy allergy and other chai concentrates contain milk but this one does not.  It's wonderful with soy milk.<br /><br />BTW...it's only a little over $3 at Wal Mart. TL;DR I love this and it's dairy free
this item has an awesome chocolate flavor. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for hot chocolate for their keurig or any machine that uses k-cups. Great product TL;DR love this
"I read all the rave reviews on line and purchased two different types of KONG toys along with the treats.  My dog loves the treats but hates the toys.  She does not like rubber toys.  Crocs sandles, burkenstocks, sticks, rocks, just not rubber intended for dogs.  Even with the treats inside she is still not motivated enough to chew on the toy to receive the reward.  Before you purchase the expensive KONGS find out if your dog will like them. TL;DR Make sure your dog likes rubber toys"
"I was purchasing the item in the market saw it on line and now am paying half the cost! AWESOME! TL;DR Great cost, 1/2 the amount in the super market!!!!"
"LMAO at these reviews. One guy says the ""cheese and garlic are overpowering""<br />and another guy says you cant taste any cheese or garlic. Hilarious.<br /><br />Anyway, Bertolli makes a good product and this is one of their most versatile.<br />Its got a mild garlic flavor that wont offend anybody, and if you want more<br />cheese you're gonna add it anyway... they do at restaurants you know! You can<br />even make Cream Chipped Beef on Toast with this stuff, and that makes a great<br />surprise breakfast with poached eggs.<br /><br />And to anybody that grew up eating ""Tuna Helper"" and is just too embarrased to<br />buy that box, this sauce + frozen green peas + fettucine and a can or two of<br />tuna and you are all set. Its better than it sounds.<br /><br />Course this stuff is also great for making a classic Alfredo. Impress your friends,<br />tell em its homemade. TL;DR Makes a great quick Tuna Alfredo"
"This mix makes the best homemade cookies ever !!  I add walnuts, real butter, and extra chocolate chips, and they are wonderful ! TL;DR Best cookies ever !!"
"This review is from my son, the crazy food eater.  Sucker itself tasted like cotton candy.  The Scorpion wasn't flavorful at all - it tasted like crunchy cardboard.  I gave it 4/5 stars because the cotton candy taste in my eyes is a win. TL;DR Ehh..."
Everything you need to get started. You can feel and taste the quality. My only concern is the sushi roll mat. The string seems to be wearing/threading out. I don't expect it to last long. TL;DR Sushi kit Rocks
"I have used this product for the last 55 plus years, it has been used by my family<br />for generations. I have recently tried other products that have taken this out of their<br />product and the taste is not the same. I will not give up the satisfaction of enjoying<br />the best flavor for some health nut's opinion that it isn't good for you. Also , the<br />reason I buy this online, when I came from the east coast I found that I couldn't get<br />this product in the stores here on the west coast.  It was really a blessing to realize<br />that I didn't have to give it up or have family send it to me. TL;DR Why listen to people about not using fructose corn syrup"
"The Gevalia Espresso T- Discs provide an excellent Espresso coffee which is equal to or better than at Starbucks!<br />By experimenting with various combinations I found for those who like the Espresso with milk, use about an ounce and a half of REGULAR milk add the desired amount of either sugar or brown sugar or molasses or Hershey's syrup, in a twelve ounce cup, heat  that in microwave for 22 seconds, then use the milk frother(you can get one at Ikea for 99 cents) for a few seconds to get a light froth- do not over froth - then use that container in the Tassimo coffee machine with the Gevalia Espresso T-Disc, after brewing is complete, hold the brew button for 12 seconds more for additional coffee, after completion stir lighly and drink. I have found that you get almost similar but slightly less satisfaction with ""King of Joe"" Espesso T-Disc also. Would like to know other user's experience with this type of brewing. TL;DR excellent espresso"
"Talk about comfort food...this is it.  I remember back to my childhood when Mom would make this pudding and I got to lick the spoon.  My children would make lipstick pudding lips and then kiss me.  One sticky mess, but pure love.  Now, I hope to share this with my grandbabies and give them lots of sticky kisses too!! TL;DR Yummy for my tummy..."
"This product is not even remotely flavored like oven roasted turkey.  I want this item cancelled.  Also, the other Spam products while flavorful, are much too salty. TL;DR disappointed"
Love this water and how the alkalinity balances acid. Was so excited when I found it on Amazon delivered to my door instead of schlepping the case from the health food store. Disappointed however that it is no longer available. TL;DR Magic Water
It doesn't get any easier than this to prepare. The flavor is wonderful. Just heat & pour on rice or your favorite pasta! Wonderful!! TL;DR Super product is all ways! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
"These were very tasty and moist and made great fig pecan bread.  Used the recipe from Amy's Bread cookbook, but veganized it.  It was great! TL;DR Moist and delicious"
"I bought a popcorn popper because I wanted to get away from microwave popcorn.  It was suggested that I purchase this seasoning along with my popper, as it would give me the taste of movie theatre popcorn.  This is way too salty.  I used it twice...in very nominal amounts.  Threw it in the trash. TL;DR Too Salty"
"I was expecting the beef stick to be like one of the pictured multipacks with a natural looking sausage type snack that is a little thick.  Instead, these individually wrapped sticks are very long but small diameter.  As such, much of the texture is the casing and not the meat.  I also wish the Original flavor was a little more peppery. TL;DR OK not great"
"Yes, this must be very good, all of the dogs loved it, and didn't want to stop licking it.  They lined up waiting their turn.  Would recommend as a treat. TL;DR Lickety Stik"
"We use this flour for making cookies, waffles, bread, whatever baked goods we want. It has a fine texture and only a slight beany taste. The price here for the same brand was cheaper than at our local health food store.  Thanks! TL;DR great flour"
"I got addicted to heat several years ago and started my extreme heat loving with Mad Dog 357 (350,000 scoville units). That sauce was super hot! Then went to the silver edition (750,000 scoville units). Woah! This ghost pepper sauce is not near as hot as those unless you add a little more. You can get the same heat from this non-extract as you can the extract! It is a really awesome hot sauce! It is much more practical in every day spicing up of foods since it doesn't have to be cut with something.<br /><br />This is a fantastic hot sauce! TL;DR This is a good hot sauce"
"This and the sauce by Boboli is amazing. Perfectly chewy, crispy, and dense.<br />Crust/sauce, then mozzarella, real parmesan, a little sharp cheddar, provolone, and then thick cut Bridgford Pepperoni.<br /><br />$5-6 for a grocery store though, not worth the price here. The stars are for the product only. TL;DR The best crust around."
"I was lucky enough to have been in Hawaii last summer- where i first discovered this amazing drink! At first- i was a little freaked out when i tasted the Aloe pulp ( as i was not expecting that); but after enjoying my very first bottle- i was automatically hooked on the taste, the benefits with the aloe; and i could not drink enough of it.<br /><br />Then- to my dismay- upon returning to Montreal, Canada where I live; I could not find it anywhere!!! The only places that I could find it online were in other provinces- and they would not ship to Montreal. (nor was it cost efficient for me)<br />Then a month ago- I was shopping in one of our largest grocery stores (IGA Select) and found it in their health section....but at over $3.50 for a small bottle- as much as I liked it- it was a little steep.<br /><br />Then I found it on Amazon- probably at the best price you can find anywhere; and even with free shipping. (They dont ship to Canada either- but I have it shipped to a USA address and a friend brings it home for me. This friendly service costs me a few bottles for sure- but well worth it!!!)<br /><br />My fridge is happily stocked with an assortment of ALO flavors; and needless to say-I have been, and will continue to; order a case or more per month!<br /><br />I am very much looking forward to trying their new flavors!!! TL;DR Simply the Best!!! From a happy ALO Junkie!!!"
"The ""Calm"" tea from tazo is a staple of this family (hence buying it in 6 pack).<br />We drink it most nights (My wife, myself and our 3 year old love it).<br />We also enjoy Celestial Seasonings ""Sleepy Time"" (green box with the bear)<br />which has a somewhat similar flavor and calming effect.<br /><br />Highly recommended! TL;DR Delicious and calming"
"I like chocolate and sweet cereals so I bought this as soon as I saw it on the shelves. It's a chocolate-filled, crunchy cereal. I like my cereal with milk but I quickly found that this is the most soggy cereal I've ever tried. Because of the texture, it's limp and wilted in no time. Like others have said, this has a grainy texture that is still noticeable when it's soggy. Very strange.<br /><br />The crunchy outside does taste decent with the chocolate filling but the filling is too liquidy. A thicker filling would have made me happier than something so syrup-y.<br /><br />It's not as bad as you might think for a sweet cereal. It has plenty of vitamins and minerals but, of course, plenty of carbs, too.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I prefer some Frosted Flakes for a sweet, breakfast cereal. TL;DR Doesn't Sate my Kravings"
"Wow!  This coffee is awesome and has become my husband's very favorite (I can't get him to try anything else!).  Thanks Amazon for providing the best price and for the free, fast shipping!  We wouldn't want him to have withdrawal symptoms!! TL;DR Amazon.com Van Houtte Creme Brulee Coffee"
I am disappointed that it did not fit my Bosch machine.  Is there any other use for it??? I doubt if it can be returned since I opened the pouch. TL;DR Doesn't fit my Bosch Brewbot
"Pretzel Crisps have no preservatives, no trans-fat, and no  high fructose corn syrup which is a plus. The pretzels are pressed flat, like crackers, and are sturdy enough to use for dips or topped with cheese. They are the perfect combination of the pretzel and the cracker.<br /><br />I tried several of the flavors and it really hard picking a favorite as all the flavors went over well in my house. Pretzel Crisps are the perfect snack for those of us looking for a healthy, delicious alternative to chips.<br /><br /> I have tried them with soup, with dips, and covered in chocolate. (Chocolate? There went the healthy part.)<br /><br />My only fault I have is I find them quite addicting. They are so good, it's hard to stop at eating just a few. TL;DR I'm Addicted.. HELP"
"These bags are very cute and just what I hoped for for my wedding favors.  My only complaint is that they have a tail of loose threads hanging off them, but that should be easy to fix. TL;DR Very cute"
"I have had an Amazon Subscription for Orville Redenbacher Pour Over Cheddar popcorn for a very long time because I really enjoyed it; when I was notified it would no longer be available, I ordered the Cheddar Cheese Microwave Popcorn that was recommended, but was fairly disappointed by it.  It lacks the texture and also the essential flavour of the other, so I will not be renewing my subscribe and save.  This product is powdery and rather dry, but flavourful enough; but it isn't quite what I'm looking for. TL;DR Not up to ""POUR OVER CHEDDAR"""
I shouldn't have bought this. I cant stop eating them. It came in the box you find in gas stations and stores and was wrapped in plastic. Arrived ahead of schedule. 5 thumbs up and amazon is bad ass!!! TL;DR Big box of awesome cherryness!!!
I ordered a bouquet for Mothers Day and they arrived at my Mother's nursing home in a crushed box. Falcon Farms immediately issued me credit for my payment AND sent a new bouquet that arrived 2 days later in perfect shape. TL;DR Falcon Farms rates an A+
"First, Mocha Java isn't Mocha...No chocolate here.  This is a well rounded, easy drinking cup of coffee. TL;DR This Coffee is Our Favorite"
"My enthusiasm for this product is mainly that I'm a Vegan and have used it as a supplement.  I believe it's only 2 tbs. for the serving and you get 45% of Iron for your recommended daily allowance which is phenomenal.  I haven't seen any other cocoa product in my experience with such a high percentage of iron except for chocolate bars coming close and of those, only the one's that really don't use filler or water down the product.  Look for ""cocoa mass"" in the ingredients list if you want the higher iron there by the way as well as a higher percentage.<br />All these compliments being said for the current time I would advise one not to order the product here as the shipping cost kills the value. TL;DR Have tried this product."
This stevia tastes great. It shipped quickly and it is priced right. We would buy it again. 100 packs of this stuff goes a long way. TL;DR Just what we needed.
"Our dog, an 11 year old lab mix, has struggled with arthritis and issues in his hips.  Our vet suggested a product like this and we have tried several favors now of the Happy Hips brand.<br /><br />I can certainly say he loves these -- as another reviewer mentioned, they're now an expected part of the morning routine and the look of betrayal should we run out ... Well, we don't run out often.<br /><br />The change in his mobility was gradual, but noticeable, it was more noticeable after we stopped giving him the strips for about two weeks after our first batch ran out.  Suddenly, he was struggling to get up the stairs again, and the sudden decline was shocking.  We checked with our vet who said this was a common reaction to,supplements like these, after a day or two of the strips again he was back to a normal, active, happy dog.<br /><br />We've used these for about 3 years now and never noticed any issues with quality or strange smells.  Our dog reports he likes the lamb and chicken, but the duck is by far his favorite. TL;DR Made a big difference for our dog"
"Great service, as always, from Amazon.<br />I enjoy this maple syrup everyday with yoghurt and with my cream of wheat. TL;DR Excellent Maple Syrup!"
I love sampler packs and trying new kinds but with this half were not even coffee instead a lot of spiced cider and hot chocolate which we do NOT drink!! Very unhappy.<br />Its even more annoying than I first noticed 12 are grove square ciders or cocoas! 4 are grove square cappunccino  and only 6 are good coffees.  Grove Square for me is the worst its always too sweet and its cheap in the stores. This assortment is way overpriced and so not worth it And I only recieved 22 not 24 TL;DR thumbs down!
"My family and I recently tasted this Switch drink (as well as the Strawberry Kiwi) flavor.  I found the cherry taste: noticeable taste without being overpowering.  My husband did not agree with me and thought the Kiwi flavor was better.<br /><br />I did find this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.  It would probably be delicious in a mixed drink or with lemon-lime soda as a spritzer, but I didn't have any hand to try it out.<br /><br />Although I found it flavorful, I probably would not buy this drink, and especially not as a substitute for soft drink for the kids. TL;DR Very good cherry taste, but a little too sweet"
I bought these for dried fruit bread.  It takes a lot of chopping to get them to the size that the food processor can handle.  The apples are a little tough to cut.  I found that buying the fruit bits saved me time and energy. TL;DR A little tough
"Very , very good product !  I love mushrooms anyway , but this and maybe a tiny bit of sea salt on most any meal dish is just great ....  Good in cooking too !  The only suggestion to the company would be to incorporate this<br />Mushroom idea into a small "" Grinder"" like they have for Pepper ...  Kevin Garder TL;DR Mushroom spice !"
"Great bulk price for my wedding candy buffet.  Nice to be able to buy in a particular color, and not the assorted mix. TL;DR Great for a candy buffet"
"I grill quite a bit so I buy many different types of rubs, sauces and such.<br /><br />I had bought a few different Webber rubs, one night I used the Burgundy Beef on some NY Strips on the grill, first I used a spike tenderizer with sunflower oil in preparation to grilling them, I then added the Burgundy Beef to them while on the grill, the smell was unreal, it was so good of a smell at first I didn't think it was mine, it was like what you smell in the parking<br />lot of a high class restaurant, the steaks were out of this world, I ordered these as I can't find them anymore. This is a win! TL;DR A Secret Seasoning"
"Everyone's tastes are different. With that said, I would definitely recommend trying these first. I tried Nescafe Chococino pods (along with some other flavors) in the machine I bought that uses these pods. Really wanted to like them but they were AWFUL. Bitter, synthetic--like something from a vending machine. The Dolce Gusto espresso/cappuccino/latte maker has been returned to Amazon; unfortunately, the pods are a grocery item so not eligible for return. I have two boxes--50 dollars' worth--of the cappuccino pods sitting in the box they arrived in--feel like I put fifty bucks into my office shredder. Bottom line is, should have tried them before ordering any equipment/pods off the internet. Save your cash--try them first! TL;DR Try them first"
"I have done lots of home baking, to include homemade pretzels.  I did not enjoy making them - it required excessive time and work and the results were only marginal.<br /><br />I bought this product at WalMart and thought I would just try it because my family likes Auntie Anne's.  I was very pleased!  The kit was simple to use, directions were clear, and the results were delicious.  My kids enjoyed making them.  We were not terribly precise when proportioning and shaping the pretzels, but it did not make any difference; the pretzels baked without any problems.<br /><br />I recommend this kit for anyone who enjoys soft pretzels.  You do not need extensive baking experience, as the kit is simple.  It makes a fun weekend family activity.  Most teens would be able to do this kit themselves, with just some oven safety oversight, creating a unique snack for sleepovers.<br /><br />I am glad Amazon stocks this item - it is a great gift surprise! TL;DR Fun Family Activity!"
Thought this was a great and pure brand but now find out this is not so.<br /><br />Have switched to Halo products. TL;DR Has some unfortunate elements
This is the same brand and type of ice tea served at a number of the PFChangs restaurants as I have bought it from them directly. Makes ice tea at home just like you can get in the restaurant. TL;DR great ice tea
"Nice flavor! The price is ok ok. It is good to have one cup once a while. However, it is too strong for me. If I drink it after 3:00 PM, I will not be able to get asleep at night. TL;DR Nice French Roast"
"This medium-large canister of ginger is the perfect size for large batch canning pickled vegetables and making herbal candies and throat lozenges. Ginger is hard to grow in our area, ""fresh"" ginger root is not fresh in our supermarkets, and this size isn't sold in any of our local stores. We transferred the remainder into smaller glass jars and have plenty for our winter Asian and Indian dishes. TL;DR Great for canners and candy makers"
"Great rice - smells like popcorn, great with all kinds of beans.  Authentic all the way.  Great to buy in bulk.  Can't go wrong.  The rice is IN a plastic bag INSIDE the burlap bag - so it IS clean rice...they should tell you that...I think the burlap bag is cool, but I think people will think bugs could get into the rice...they can't it in a plastic bag inside.  Easy to cook - tastes good. TL;DR Great with beans"
I just found mold in my package. I used to eat better goji berries by different brands. I wont buy them again TL;DR mold
"Good, strong cup of coffee.  I agree, it seems to have a lot of caffeine.  But the flavor is nice and bitter, the color is dark, the packaging convenient, and the price is right.  Nothing wrong with trying it if you like strong coffee. TL;DR Good Strong Cup of Coffee"
With some raw sugar and a high fat milk it is delicious.  It is strong yet smooth. This tea is a family staple. TL;DR A lovely tea
Thank you Amazon.  When my local Natual Foods COOP failed financially last year I was lost in this rural community without many of the foods that had become a part of our daily life.  Twisted fruit is family favorite and Amazon is my favorite suppler.  This is a healthy pocket food for my teenager and a stuffer for my elementry son's lunches. TL;DR finding the items we can't live without
"I bought these cakes at my local health food store. They look nothing like the images on the box in which they come. They have no trace of cocoa!! They have nothing of the lightness of actual pound cake. They are heavy and too sweet. They taste like a chunk of fat and sugar - which is what they are: the second ingredient after eggs is sugar and then vegetable shortening.  That, especially the latter item, should say it all. TL;DR Not what they claim to be"
This product is a great purchase!  It is a great conversation piece and a great hot sause.  My husband first had it while stationed in Afghanistan and wanted to share it with the rest of the family.  Would definately purchase again. TL;DR Love
This product was TWO YEARS past the expiration date. I didn't even open it. Amazon states that they will not return food items and that is fine but they and the companies that sell food items SHOULD LOOK AT THE EXPIRIATION DATE BEFORE THEY SEND IT!!! Very Unhappy Customer TL;DR Expiration Date
"My Mom bought this Tea and gave me a few bags to take home and try.....OMG, without a doubt one of the best Tea's I have ever tasted! Most tea's just taste like hot water. This one is soooo flavorfull..such a wonderful cinnamon flavor.  Tastes like you are eating a bag of red hots, and just a little bit of sugar and its so sweet! This is def my new obsession! TL;DR Im in TEA Heaven!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I don't know if I will spend $3 for a small bowl of rice, but this is honestly the best instant rice I have ever had. Yum. TL;DR A little pricey, but yum."
"I bought these for my four month old puppy, who is teething. She loves them! They keep her busy chewing for hours on end! I highly recommend them. TL;DR Excellent item!"
"This is my second try at the dessert gum flavors by Extra. My first try was the strawberry shortcake flavor, which tasted fine but had a weird aftertaste. This flavor is much better in my opinion.<br /><br />This tastes exactly like an apple pie, or as close to it as gum can get. The flavor doesn't last nearly as long as I want it to, but for that initial 1-2 minutes there's a really great burst of flavor. This is pretty much the only reason I took the 1 star off.<br /><br />Overall, I will be buying this flavor again. TL;DR Great, but loses flavor far too quickly"
"My favorite K-Cup flavor! A mild rather than a strong coffee strength, it really has a flavor reminiscent of a local donut shop or Denny's cup of coffee.<br />Highly recommended! TL;DR My Favorite K-Cup"
"Ordered two bags a while ago and they were a hit with anyone that came over that wanted a quick snack. The old order didn't have resealable bags which caused them to dry out (yes, I should have put them into a bag myself), but the new ones come with a zip-lock built into the bag. Bonus!<br /><br />I put this one on a Amazon subscription -- I don't want to run out ;) TL;DR Great flavor, now has a resealable bag"
"I have no complaints about the lollipops themselves. They're about the size of a stack of 3 quarters, taste sweet & fruity with just a little bit of tartness, and are individually packaged nicely on a paper stick. All have natural coloring, so they don't stain as other lollipops would (I NEVER give my daughter anything with blue coloring.)<br /><br />I ordered these directly from amazon.com (not an outside party) & didn't receive the flavor assortment as described on the webpage. I got a tub of 150 lollipops, but only 3 flavors: razzmatazz berry, tooberry blueberry (not blue at all, reddish in color), & strawberry smash. Fortunately for me, I (& my daughter) love all the flavors & would have picked these flavors myself if purchasing the lollipops in a store. But, I had no way of knowing this & probably would have been very upset if I had received a citrus assortment or something different.<br /><br />Again, the lollipops are great, but the description should be more accurate. TL;DR Great lollipops, but not exactly as described."
"If you have ever wished that your honey roasted peanuts would be consistent with a sweet taste, look no further, Emerald has mastered the process.  Don't bother with the rest all they have is a weak substitute.  Don't be fooled these carry the extra calories for a reason, they are coated with honey on every piece from the start to the finish. TL;DR Best Honey Roasted Peanuts"
I ordered my beans on Saturday and got them on Wednesday. I opened them and found the free beans on top and they smelled amazing. I smelled the 1 lb bag and they also were amazing. I look forward to the homemade vanilla extract. I will write again once I am able to have some extract. I am sure it will be just as good as I hope maybe even better. TL;DR Awesome Beans
"On my ""rest days"" (am a shift worker) I like to enjoy a nice mug or two of coffee.  Whilst browsing the different coffees for my new percolater, I came across this ready brew by starbucks, and thought I like starbucks lets try it.<br />Not at all disappointed, gave one to each of the girls that work with me in the office and they each said that they liked it too.<br /><br />Generally I dont like to add sugars to my hot drinks, and from the smell of the coffee after the water was added I thought the drink was going to be terribly sweet.  But no - I used a non-sweetened creamer and my travel mug from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060VJO82"">Starbucks Ground Coffee, Travel Mug & Ceramic Mug</a>  and had a perfect mug of coffee, infact when I finished the first one I had a second.  So I totally recommend this.<br />Tho be warn there are only 7 servings in the packet which currently works out to be $2.19 per serving.<br />Didnt matter at the time cos I got the packet as a taster, but now that I am considering re-ordering, seems a tad on the expensive.  :-) TL;DR Addictive"
This product is amazing I use it to create a variety in the tortillas I prepare and I use it for cakes as well. It tastes absolutely amazing. Although adding a little bit of xanthan gum also helps solve the problem of it rising well for bakery. TL;DR awesome for people tired of corn goods
"Missing the flavor of shortbread because of gulten intolerance? Try the line of Pamela's cookies and products. This cookie is sweet, crunchy goodness with out the gluten, large chunks of dark chocolate round out a flavorful treat. TL;DR wonderful cookie"
"this is my favorite flavor of crystal lite but i couldn't find it anywhere, thankfully i could get a huge batch of it on amazon so it will last me quite a while. thank you! TL;DR tastes great!"
"Seriously. I want to cook it in a spoon and mainline it.<br /><br />I can't cluck about this stuff enough.<br /><br />If your supplies are limited, dilute it with plain soy milk (about 60% chocomint, 40% plain), it will taste the same and last longer!<br /><br />Also available at a chain called Sprouts if you can find those...<br /><br />If I were a condemned person, I would have THIS as my last meal. TL;DR YUMMIEST THING EVAR"
"I've given both of my puppies look-alike and similar products and these are by far the best.  I have never met a dog that does not LOVE these! I've given them to friends and they can't believe how much more their dogs love these compared to what they had previously thought were their dogs' ""favorite"" chews. I call these my puppy baby sitters because they are miraculous at occupying my puppy and satisfying his chewing needs.  I have a small breed puppy and they are the perfect size and shape for him to hold and chew (not too bulky/big).  These can be difficult to come by (I've only found them at specialty pet stores) and are relatively expensive, so it is definitely worth it to order them in bulk from Amazon - you'll save time and money. TL;DR Puppy Miracle Product"
"First of all kudos, this product arrived and in wonderful condition. The candy was packed with ice packs. Believe it or not when I opened the box a couple of the bags still had ice chunks, and it was almost 90 degrees when it arrived. The shipper did an extraordinary job.<br /><br />The candy itself was fresh as well as abundant.  You would be crazy not to take advantage of this deal. The container/cooler can be used again, and is quite large as are the ice bags reuseable also.  If you have chocolate lovers in your home in your neighborhood, you can't go wrong. TL;DR I'm Impressed"
"5 stars out of 5!<br /><br />To me this is the king of kings in Taco Sauce land. So grab your royal scepter, place thyn crown upon thou cranium, sit in thyn gold plated and jewel encrusted throne, for tonight my friends, you dine with the best.<br /><br />I love this taco sauce, and have been addicted to it for about a year now. Though it isn't for everyone, of my family I am the only one who really likes this stuff, everyone else is like ""meh"" or ""it was ok"".<br /><br />It gives a slightly smokey bbq like flavor to the taco, with a little spicy hit. Not terribly spicy, though I am the kind of guy who is very used to hot sauces, I go through a LOT of Tabasco sauce each year. I can literally drink a whole bottle of tabasco if I wanted *though I don't because I know the next morning I will be extremely sorry I did*. Though I don't buy this sauce to make my taco ""hotter"" rather I buy it because I love the flavor. The only con I can find, is I wish it were a little cheaper, and in a much larger bottle. I would be extremely happy if it was in ketchup sized bottles for say 5 bucks each. I go through a lot of this stuff.<br /><br />I should also note here that the other 2 flavors in this line of sauce *Spicy ranch and Jalapeno"" are not nearly as good. Jalapeno I can enjoy on hotdogs, but the ranch flavor isn't good on anything in my opinion.<br /><br />I prefer this chipotle sauce in soft shell tacos, and until I find something I like better, I'll keep buying this stuff. I will say that Eric Cartman has the right idea, could use some Choptle-away from Billy Mays. Overdoing it with this sauce can cause some painful bathroom visits, usually in the morning functioning as your own natural alarm clock. And I should also note that the smell coming out is horrendous pending on how much you had. The smell is soo bad even from your flatulence I could see it ending marriages, so guys always check your wife or girl friend agro meters before daring to partake of this forbidden but illustrious and decadent delicacy!<br /><br />Why would anyone eat something that does this to them, Kyle might ask..... but in the words of Cartman who said it best..<br /><br />""Dude. Have you had chipotle? It's really good."" TL;DR Best taco sauce I ever had."
"I really love this Tonnino ventrescas tuna. I had been a shopper at BJ's wholesale club for many years. They offered a similar product of tuna filet that I would purchase often(double pack 6 oz jar). As usual, though, they discontinued selling it in their clubs.<br /><br />So I took to the internet, searching various sites, checking out Amazon.com. Came across the ventrescas filets on the site. I have not regretted the purchase. I like that it is packed in olive oil and jarred(no can taste). The price was the best at approx $6.46 a jar. I bought two cases which brought the price under $6.00 a jar. The vendor(Taylor's Market) packaged the shipment great, no broken jars. Great customer service.. TL;DR Best catch in the sea.."
"Someone gave me a bar as a gift.  I had no idea it would be this good.  Better than other orange/choc combos, it has a nice crunch to the peel bits. Yum. TL;DR Best orange chocolate i have tried"
"Have been buying all the tetra-packs (zico, real, vita, ...) for a very long time so was excited to see this dehydrated coconut water. I liked the concept of not shipping all that water around if you can extract the ""good stuff""... reduced cost and environmentally better... but unfortunately it did not turn out (for me) to be the best thing since sliced bread :( No matter how much or how little powder I add to the glass of cold/warm water, it just DOES NOT taste like real coconut water.. or even like the tetrapacks. I really wanted to like it but taste is obviously diluted for amounts of powder they recommend as a serving... and when you slowly increase the amount you add, the ""dextrose"" part of the powder kicks in... and adds that weird sweetness. In short, for me the taste was not acceptable...  even for the saved cost and environmentally friendliness....  back to the tetra-packs.... except when I can get close to some *real* coconuts, that is! TL;DR Good concept... but at the cost of taste :("
"Even if you think you know Italian dry mushrooms -- order these and find out how wrong you were.  Unbelievably beautiful, deeply fragrant, terrific huge intact slices.  Flip all the cards over: these completely redefine the category.  Not just for sauces: soak a few to garnish your steak.  Make a knockout appetizer with these porcini, some stock and a shot of marsala.  To top it all: the price is reasonable.  Bravo! TL;DR Knock your socks off"
"Since I discovered this wonderful relish in England a few years ago I have tried to buy replacements in this country. It is served at most pubs in the UK as part of a Ploughman's Lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies. It has a wonderful taste and texture, unlike anything in this country. I recommend every one buy some. I've found it only on Amazon. TL;DR Branston Pickle (Relish)"
Great whole kernel bread if you are looking for a healthy bread!  Toast it twice as the bread is long and ya have to flip it.  It is very filling and nutritious. TL;DR yummy
The product has withstood the ravages of time and is a Brit favorite. The product packing was good but the box the seven packs came in was very poorly packed resulting in a 20% breakage TL;DR Biscuit v cookie
"I purchased a couple of bottles for my co-workers and myself to try, and I am regretting it. Now I wasn't expecting much from this in the first place since it's a novelty drink, and I knew it wasn't going to taste exactly like a strip of bacon. However the smell of the drink was awful, it tasted like flat Diet Pepsi, and the aftertaste killed any joy I had in tasting this concoction.<br /><br />I would only recommend purchasing this drink to use as a collector item/display, or to play a prank on someone by switching out their drink. TL;DR Worse than what I expected."
"I had purchased the other ShaunWhite White Mint limited edition and loved it so I thought I would try this flavor. I don't like it as well, but that doesn't mean that it isn't good, just not to my liking. I hope there is some of the White Mint flavored gum still available because I will buying more of it! TL;DR Okay flavor"
"I try to make most of my son's baby food, but mainly stick with veggies.  I wanted to get some good baby fruit choices and I've been really impressed with Earth's Best products.  My little guy LOVES these fruits.  This starter kit contains pears, apples and bananas.  I love that I can get this organic variety pack delivered to my door for less than some regular baby food prices at the store.  I love the subscribe and save option, because 15% is a nice discount with free Prime shipping through Amazon Mom.  It's a great deal for quality food. TL;DR Okay, my baby loves it!"
this was recommend by my chiropractor. i am sleeping better and back pain has decreased a lot.  taste is nice. TL;DR good product
"If you like balsamic vinegar dressing, you will love this glaze.  It is thick and viscous--and it pours slowly out of the bottle.  Looks like a slightly thinner version of molassas.  And it tastes amazing--someone else wrote on a review here that is balsamic vinegar on steroids--so accurate!  I use it in several different ways:<br /><br />1.  As Marindate/Sauce for Chicken or Fish:  I pan fry a few pieces of skinless chicken breast, and towards the end, I drizzle a little of this glaze on the top--It helps it carmalize AND adds a great flavor.<br /><br />2.  I use it instead of salad dressing and struesel this tasty glaze on the top and mix it with the salad tongs.  A little goes a long way for me, and it has a wonderful pungent kick.<br /><br />The very best thing is that this glaze is very low calorie if you are watching your weight.  It has no fat, which makes it easy to add to any diet.  And if you are like me, andnot a fan of leafy green vegies, it masks all those horrible rabbit-loving green tastes.<br /><br />This glaze can be expensive in the stores--and hard to find (at least in my area).  I ended up buying a case directly from the manufacturer, which turned out to be the best deal.  But Amazon's price is not out of the range of what I would pay for this incredible tasty, low calorie glaze.  YUM! TL;DR LOVE This SO Much I Bought a Case"
"Best steak marinade out there.  Easy (just uses water) and so, so, simple.  No overnight crap - just marinate and grill and TASTES WONDERFUL!!! TL;DR We won't use any other marinade for steak!"
This is the best powdered chicken broth on the market. I also appreciated the fact that it is gluten free. TL;DR Wonderful product
"As I have gotten older my tolerance for acid seems to be lessening. Sometimes I just can't tolerate coffee, but I love it, and the darker the better.  I tried other brands of low acid coffee but found them weak and tasteless.  This Puroast coffee is the best! Very smooth, with a great deep flavor.  Worked well in my Keurig also.  Absolutely no bitterness and no acidic issues. I recommend trying it if you are having issues.<br /><br />I will be buying this again. TL;DR Best low acid coffee"
This is the best raspberry jam I've found. Full berry flavor and not overly sweet. I'm glad to find it on Amazon. TL;DR Best raspberry jam
"When I run out of these, my dog reluctantly eats other treats, but I can tell she is not happy.  My cats even try to steal them from her.<br /><br />It's hard to find good quality pet snacks without a lot of additives and grain free.  These Dogswell brand are the best. TL;DR My dog loves these!"
"It bugs me when I buy groceries from starbucks and look at the expiration date on the package and it's very soon.<br /><br />In this case, I got the coffee pods yesterday, and they expire 6 days from today.<br /><br />Not very cool. TL;DR Starbucks Groceries are often close to their expiration date"
"Just add more (or less for those of you that like weaker coffee) grounds than usual and you will get a decent cup of coffee (I do this with other Decafs I've tried).  Tops is the price-----can't go wrong with it.  Try it, you'll like it. TL;DR Decaf Cafe"
"The Mushroom Popcorn seemed to have about half pop nothing like the mushroom popcorn I've had before, it looks like regular popcorn. That being said, it is good popcorn and the pieces that pop correctly melt in your mouth. TL;DR Mushroom Popcorn - 2#"
"This tea stands out to me as a tea you'll either like or dislike. The aroma and taste is enticing. For me I first tasted the chocolate - a good-tasting chocolate! Next I tasted the mint - not too strong, that's good too! Then, to my surprise after I drank a few more sips I tasted vanilla. Vanilla, to my knowledge is not in this tea - but I DO taste it, and like it!! So....it must be that the blend of this tea can cause a possible interaction on ones palette that resembles a tastes of vanilla (At least in my case). I like the tea, but not love it!  It's unusual and might take a glass or two, or a cup or two. of getting use to. On the other hand my son did not like it at all. So...........that's why I say ""you'll either like it or dislike it"". Only your taste-buds can let you know for sure. TL;DR You'll either like it or dislike it"
"I grew up on hamburger helper.  It was in my mom's arsenal for quick tasty meals.  I'm sure you could use ground turkey or ground chicken if you don't eat ground beef as a replacement for this.  My boys love when I use velveeta for our nachos, so as a pasta dish it was enjoyed!  Thanks Velveeta for coming up with a quick dish! TL;DR Velveeta hamburger helper style"
"I first served this olive oil with bread for a dinner party and my guests couldn't stop raving about it.  It is wonderfully light, fruity and refreshing!  I've since drizzled it on pastas and veggies and loved it - it turned ordinary dishes into extraordinary ones.  I'm sold! TL;DR light and fruity!"
"It's my husband's favorite so far.  Tastes just like cheesecake.  And how virtuous we feel, being low fat and no sugar! TL;DR Fabulous"
"I loved this Item.<br /><br />I bought them as a Birthday gift for one of my best friends that lives on the states and she loved it, she sent me pics of everything the package was perfect and everything included was delicios. it arrived on time too.<br /><br />I will def. buy more from this vendor in the future TL;DR It was Beautiful"
trying out gluten free options..i found this pizza crust.<br /><br />OH so good we make up two pizzas a week for the family.<br /><br />and now use our Oven Stone (highly recomend you do so as well)..it crisps the crust up SO well!<br /><br />TY Chebe a Crust i can comsume *big ol grin* TL;DR great way to make a pizza crust!!!
"For my dog:<br />I have been using this oil for a couple weeks now on & off.  I have just started giving it to my dog (who has been limping & having trouble rising from a sitting & laying position)for about a week now.  HE LOVES IT!  He can't wait to get his dog treat in the morning with it smeared on one side and in the afternoon it is the first thing he eats out of his food (I put about a tablespoon sized dollop on top of his dry dog food).  I have definitely noticed an improvement in his mobility & his coat seems to be much softer.  I had also done some research & found out that it will eliminate stinky dog breath!  I can't wait for that to happen. It is safe for cats too... If you want to know more about giving it to your pets, just do a Google search using the words ""coconut oil for my pets"" and plenty of info will be at your fingertips! :)<br /><br />For my kids:<br />I have done extensive research on Coconut oil & the benefits it has on our bodies. I can tell you that the antiviral benefit it has definitely works. My son (recently turned 12)just recently had a virus that included coughing, a sore throat and had caused him to break out in a rash that only spread onto one side of his body... Doctor said it had to run it's course.  I started giving him some of this oil on toast with the normal butter & cinnamon sugar & within a couple days he started getting better. We stopped giving him the oil & he got sick again... So we started the oil again, but this time HE was putting it on things, himself, to eat--he realized that it was making him better the first time. I think that maybe we didn't give it enough time to work the first time.  For my daughter: After a couple of days of sleeping a ton, being very sick & calling me at work crying because she couldn't stay awake, I took my daughter (13 y.o. then, 17 y.o. now) to the doctor & she was diagnosed with Mono. The doctor explained to me that it is part of the Epstein Barr family (cold sores, herpes, etc.) and that there isn't any kind of medicine that can ""cure"" the illness. He explained that she would sleep a lot, that I needed to call her school & tell them what she had & that she would only be there half days for a few months. I was deflated, stressed & couldn't believe there was nothing I could do for her. I had recently read a book that included coconut oil as a way to detox, lose weight, boost metabolism and so many others and had bought some oil to cook with & take daily. I had done a search & read as much as I could about the coconut & remembered reading that it killed the Epstein Barr virus. I went straight to my computer when I got home & did another search & found the article I had read. I decided to give my daughter the oil twice a day to see if it helped her. I called her down & melted the oil in a spoon & had her take it that afternoon & then again later that evening. The next morning before I left for work I gave her another dose. She called me around lunch time very happy and excited and said she wasn't tired and could stay awake. I remember thinking that the oil was working and was very relieved, but still a bit hesitant. When I got home to my surprise, she was very excited, wide awake & for the first time since she was sick, was chipper and I could tell she was getting back to her old self. I gave her another dose of the oil that evening & for a few days after and she was all better. The oil had killed the virus and restored her health.<br /><br />This stuff is amazing... it cooks food well & is fabulous for your skin.  If you burn in the sun, this will help prevent that as well.  If you are a coconut user this stuff is great... If you're not, this is worth a try. TL;DR Awesome Coconut oil & great price!!"
"When they say mammoth, they mean mammoth.<br /><br />I thought I was buying a bone on the large side. Uh, the thing weighs a ton and looks like the shin bone of a cow. Or a dinosaur. It's 18"" long. It would take my dog about a year of gnawing, but he'd be happy the whole time. TL;DR This is a little embarrassing, but..."
"Tea taste great; meets purpose expections, however, is strong so by all means follow directions. TL;DR Kentucky"
"I have a hot dog cart in WA state. Our Health Department rules state that we cannot make chili unless we have a commisary. This mustard is chili without complications. I have already used a bottle for personal enjoyment, and took it out on our first event for the season (nevermind it is snowing today). Rave reviews from myself and my customers, and no Health Department intervention!!! Made a call to the company because it is cheaper on their website, HOWEVER... when you include the shipping they have to charge there, they recommended that I buy on Amazon. What a find!!<br /><br />Deb Blecha<br />mymfva.org TL;DR Mustard up a good review!"
"It's a delicious, malty black tea. Even better with sugar and milk. The ""pyramid"" bag is easy to use and brews quickly. If you drink tea every day, try this one! TL;DR Great Breakfast or anytime tea...."
This shows signs of being a discontinued product. It has certainly disappeared from Oregon stores and I know our current isn't currently going out on a limb for consumer protection. I stockpiled enough to give me time to reformulate it or get close enough for jazz. Not using those disastrous little plastic bags for anything other than a road trip will be a serious improvement. Its cheaper too. Here the initial thought:<br /><br />search this on Amazon: Matcha Green Tea Powder<br />search on google: nature's flavors TL;DR doomed tea?
"Yes, these do smell fishy straight out of the package but you just need to rinse them for a few minutes and the smell will go away. Also, whatever sauce you use will soak into the noodle and you will not taste any fishiness. I make a very tasty asian dish with these noodles, some cut up chicken breast and Liquid Aminos as the sauce and the total calories is about 100 for a serving! You cannot beat that! Not only that, these noodles will make you feel full afterwards. Definitely worth trying - keep an open mind & prepare them right and you will NOT be disappointed! TL;DR WONDERFUL HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE!!"
My husband does most of the cooking.  He was very pleased with the product. I would give it again as a gift for anyone who cooks. TL;DR Bought it as a gift
The package arrived quickly and boxed nicely. I was so surprised it came in such a timely manner! Thank you! TL;DR Quick!
"The Vegg is an amazing product!  I'm a vegan who doesn't miss meat, cheese or dairy - but eggs!  This is the perfect solution for all of those with egg cravings, low-cholesterol diets or those who are allergic to eggs.  It tastes exactly like the real thing but without the cruelty or cholesterol!!  BUY THIS!  You won't regret it! TL;DR AMAZING!"
Best price I can find online.  I can't locate any local store that carries this flavor.  Wish this was offered an auto-ship to save 15% and quicker shipment. TL;DR Best Price
"The chocolate was as good as we expected.  Preferring darker nutrition dense and flavorfull foods, this met our expectations.  We will purchase other products from this company as we have need. TL;DR great chocolate"
"This has been a firm favorite at breakfast time in our house for many years. When you can pick it up at this low price for a 4 pack, it seems to taste even better. TL;DR Quaker Instant Oatmeal Dinosaur Eggs"
"The tree came very well packaged and in fair condition considering it had just been in a box for a few days. However, after further inspection, I discovered that it not only had sow bugs and a baby millipede in the soil, it also had a minor case of spider mites. Although I took care of this fairly easily with some soapy water and a spray bottle, I felt a little ripped off that I just bought a tree with that many pests crawling around. It took a little longer to get rid of the bugs in the soil, since i had to just grab and kill them when I saw them. However, the tree still fared well and is still going very nicely 5 months later. I would say it was definitely worth it even considering the bugs. TL;DR Pretty good, but not pest free."
"I FIRST FOUND THIS PRODUCT AT A BREAD OUTLET STORE. BUT IT CLOSED . I AM SO GLAD TO FIND THIS GRAVY HERE !THIS IS THE BEST GRAVY EVER! ALTHOUGH THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE BROWN GRAVY,ALL THEIR VARIETIES ARE GOOD .I HAVE ALSO USED  THE ROAST BEEF,CHICKEN, TURKEY ,AND THE COUNTRY WHITE GRAVY . THIS A LARGE PACKAGE. IT MAKES 3 CUPS AND COSTS ABOUT THE SAME AS OTHER PACKETS THAT MAKE ONLY ONE CUP!BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL AT ONCE!JUST MAKE AS MUCH AS YOU NEED AND STORE THE REST IN AN  AIRTIGHT CONTAINER I MAKE MY ENCHILADA SAUCE WITH THE CHICKEN GRAVY!JUST ADD GARLIC POWDER, AND CHILI POWDER TO YOUR TASTE AND A LITTLE MORE WATER !YOU CAN ALSO USE THE BEEF ONE THE SAME WAY!

IT IS CHEAPER HERE THAN ORDERING THROUGH THE COMPANY!AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE 24 PACAKAGES TO THE CASE.YOU CAN  SHARE THE COST TOGETHER WITH YOUR FRIENDS! TL;DR best gravy ever!"
"Kellogg's Raisin Bran is the perfect balance of bran flakes with lots of juicy, slightly sugared raisins,<br />The ""sweet"" cereal for people who don't always like sweet cereal.<br />It's a classic! TL;DR Gotta Love It!"
"Excellent cat food that is recognizable as a food. (I find that it looks and smells a lot better than some of the canned stuff that *I* eat.) I highly recommend it.<br />If you have a cat with a grain allergy like I do, a number of the Weruva flavors are completely grain free. The ones that aren't only use rice. TL;DR Weruva cat food"
I bought this product because my 18 year old cat just wasn't eating anything and I wasn't ready to lose her.  She loved this stuff and I know it gave her an extra six months of her life because she was losing weight at a fast pace - eating this stopped the weight loss.  I would recommend it for anyone who has a sickly or older cat. TL;DR Great for older cats
"Quite yummy, not overly sweet, yet satisfies that desire for a sweet treat (thank you, cranberries!). I used this product to help break a longtime candy/sugar habit. Pecans. Dried cranberries. Black pepper. Mmmm. TL;DR Sahale Snacks Valdosta Blend"
"This is a product, not seller, review.  The seller was fine; very prompt delivery, and I would order other Nissin products from them again; but not the Hearty Chicken Cup Noodles.  It was a disappointment; not up to the quality of the other Nissin Cup Noodles line, which I like and continue to enjoy.  This Hearty Chicken was hardly hearty.  Just noodles and chicken broth, and rather bland.  I was expecting a richer version of their old Creamy Chicken Cup Noodles, but this product has no veggies or chicken meat, and far less zip.  It is decidedly inferior to their regular Chicken Cup Noodles. TL;DR Disappointing"
"I have like Vegemite when visited Australia but thought to finally give Marmite a try. Really love rich taste of the Marmite XO. Will enjoy and certainly want more when finished. Disappointed that was offered for $16.99 and eligible for Prime Shipping only day before I ordered but then when went to check out next day was $22.99. It's not a great deal since can ordered on several other sites, even on Marmite site for much less including shipping from U.K. Maybe they'll decide to add on subscribe and save in 2 pack at better original rate. They'll sell much more that way! TL;DR Excellent!"
I was very happy with the asst. of coffee I received. It's almost exactly as the photo shows! I will be buying more! TL;DR Great Assortment
I love this product.  Great for keeping me hydrated and balancing those electrolites.  I've been using this for years and can't bike ride without it. TL;DR Love It
"There are too many almonds in both containers.  I'm not a big fan of almonds, but if you like almonds, you will definitely like these.<br /><br />Overall, the nuts tasted pretty fresh, but personally I thought it was too salty. TL;DR Too many almonds"
"I'm a mother of 19 months old and started using this formula when my son was about 9 months and used it for about 3-4 months till he switched to a cow's milk. I did tons of research before deciding on this formula. I thought it was the best one on the market. I have recently found out about a study that published horrifying results about organic brown rice syrup (the main ingredient in Baby's Only used as a sweetener in organic food products as an alternative to high fructose corn syrup). The researchers found that the two baby formulas that contained brown rice syrup had arsenic levels that were far above the EPA standard for drinking water and more than 20 times greater than each of the 15 formulas that didn't contain brown rice syrup. These products were Baby's Only Organic Dairy Toddler Formula and Baby's Only Organic Soy Toddler Formula, both made by Nature's One.<br />Arsenic levels in the two formulas were also higher than the World Health Orgnanization's ""maximum tolerable daily intake"" standard for babies, who are particularly vulnerable to arsenic's neurological effects because of their small size and developing brain.<br /><br />As a mother, I feel dreadful to realize I was giving my child something that could be harmful to him. I just want to warn other mothers  about the results so they can make a wise decision.<br /><br />[...] TL;DR Organic brown rice syrup containes arsenic"
"I first tried Vegeta after hearing about it while visiting Eastern Europe in the late 90's.  It has since become a kitchen staple.  I use Vegeta when making soups, stews, Chicken or Veal Marsala or Piccata.  Vegeta can be used to season rice or pasta.  Since it is made from vegetables, I have used it to enrich the flavor of vegetarian Thanksgiving 'stuffing'.  Vegeta can also be used to enhance sauces and gravies.  If you haven't tried Vegeta, I urge you to do so.  I believe that it is widely used across Europe. TL;DR Must Have Seasoning for Your Kitchen"
"I purchased these chews on the recommendation of my vet.  I have been very pleased with the results.  The plaque that was present on my dog's teeth was quickly removed and my dog absolutely loves them.  The only downside is that they do stink, but it's not that bad. I highly recommend these dog treats. TL;DR Great product"
Product was shipped promptly and packaged very nicely.  All of the plants were very attractive and healthy in appearance.  The directions that came with the plants were easy to follow.  I was very pleased with my purchase. TL;DR 3 different carn plants
"My local stores seem to have quit carrying this product so I've been trying to find another fine sea salt.  Problem is, I have not found a single salt that is near as fine as this product.  It is what some call ""popcorn salt"".<br /><br />LOVE this product!! TL;DR Truely a FINE sea salt"
"My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it, which gives it the illusion of being thick.  The problem is that, when my hair gets a little long, the weight of the top layers of hair weigh down the lower ones, making my hair look heavy and, well, blah.  I gravitate toward root-boosting products to restore natural body by giving my fine hairs a little lift.  After using this conditioner, my hair retains its body throughout the day.  Even better, I love the scent -- I can smell it as I write this, and it's been hours since I got out of the shower.  Obviously, if you are bothered by perfumes, you should look elsewhere.<br /><br />I'm really pleased with this shampoo.  It's going to be in my shopping cart when the current bottle starts to run out.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann TL;DR I love it!"
Did not like these. Tried them to help with pregnancy nausea. They did not work for me. TL;DR Yuck
My husband and I love this seasoning it is soooo delicious!  We love to use it on Tritip and pork! TL;DR Best Seasoning EVER!
"My cat loves this food.  He is also noticeably healthier.  He is somewhat of an older cat (9 years) and when I first got him from a friend who could no longer care for him, he had dandruff on his fur and was extremely overweight.  This food has helped his dandruff problem and he has also lost some weight since (he's still fat but not as fat as he was).  I definitely plan to continue feeding him this for the rest of his life. TL;DR Cat loves it"
"This is unheard of... at Whole Foods, EB formula is $38.  With this deal, each can is ~$10.  They are the large size, same formulation as you find in the store, and arrived in a timely fashion.  I still think it was some sort of error that this deal was posted. TL;DR yes... this deal is ""for real"""
"Finally a bread I will eat! I have tried tons of bread store baught and mixed and have even used my bread machine with no luck. Finally I tried the Schar classic roll and I still wasnt fond of the texture so I was slicing them up and wasting half the bun because it crumbled and fried the rest with butter and cheese..""ie a grilled cheese"" then I found the classic bread already sliced thinner and lets just say after popping this in a toaster and putting italian beef on top of it I hardley noticed the difference from regular bread. I give it the 3 out of 5 becuase of course it will never be as good as regular bread texture wise or flavor and I am hoping schar will continue to expand their line with bread made with more flavor ..ie garlic bread, faccocia bread ect. Still I am a big fan and will buy again! TL;DR Finally a bread I will eat!"
"We liked these bars so much, we actually subscribed to the Variety Pack and got one of these delivered to us every month. Sadly, following the recent peanut butter scare, Amazon canceled our subscription and the kids are missing them being delivered on a regular basis.<br /><br />This is the one-flavor option and choco chips is one of my girl's favorite . The bars are just about the right size - not too small but small enough for the kids to get 2 of them in one day if they earned them. I sometime take a bar myself after exercising or I take one or 2 with me to office and have them with tea in the morning as breakfast.<br /><br />After many months of ZBaRs subscription it would be fair to say that we enjoy them very much. I like them because they are made with good-quality (organic) ingredients, they are chock-full of vitamins, don't have a lot of fat and contain zero hydrogenated oils, fructose, corn syrup or the artificial preservatives and flavor enhancers that just about anything we buy these days seems to have in abundance. The kids like them because they are tasty.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />- the size is right<br />- taste great<br />- kids love it<br />- on a subscription you get 15% off and free delivery<br /><br />One note of caution. The all organic, no artificial preservatives, environmentally friendly packaging seems to cause the bars to get progressively drier as time passes. If you want a chewy, fully satisfying experience, do not plan to store them for months. One month seems to be okay though.<br /><br />Go for them (I went) :)<br /><br />P.S. - The 18-bar or 36-bar if available should be the optimal quantities if subscribing. There's a little money to be saved that way. TL;DR Our kids approve these bars. I eat them too"
"My family loves, this - 2 year old included.  Great ingredients, great flavor.  We like to mix it w/ rice pasta and cheese.  It's my cold weather standby. TL;DR A staple in our pantry"
"Great salad dressing mix.  Simple to make and it is all organic so it is good for the body and over all over health, TL;DR Great stuff"
Can Lindt chocolates even be reviewed?<br /><br />They are the perfect chocolate if you ask me! :) TL;DR Lindt.....
"Got this for 1/4 the price of my local supermarket, and it was delivered right to my door.  Seem to go through a box so quickly, so having the extra bulk around the apartment isn't so bad. Plus, I'll dump two into a sealed cereal saver, and keep it nice and crispy.  Get a couple more items and Super Saver Shipping, and it's a steal. TL;DR Great Price, Fast Delivery"
"Replicates my Starbucks chai latte, but caffeine free.  Not quite as sickly sweet as the mixture they use, so you may want to use a bit more than usual if you like it sweet. TL;DR Great for making your own chai lattes at home"
"I have a real strange stomach, cannot eat Toast or anything in the line of regular Breakfast items. So for years I eat Wasa Bread, Found the one from you is the BEST buy for the $.<br />Thank you TL;DR my Breakfast food :-)"
"I've been trying a few Kombuchas and get this one when I'm in whole foods because they only have a few brands and this is the cheapest. None of the others spill all over the place like this one. I thought that it was because i was shaking it by accident but now I realize that it's not that. And, honestly, it doesn't really taste as good as some of the others. Sorry. TL;DR Explodes every time"
"After ordering this tea, I thought, ""What was I thinking?"" but I'm glad that I did order it. Trying to describe this tea is kind of like trying to describe Coca-Cola to someone that has never had it. There are definitely flavors of cocoa and nutmeg, but this isn't like drinking watered down cocoa.  While the flavors in this tea are familiar in themselves, the combination is unique and definitely worth a try.  I'm sorry that I can't better describe this tea....the Coke analogy kept running through my head as I thought about what I would write.  I do recommend this tea as an experience of something new and different. TL;DR Chocolate Puerh -- A New Experience"
"I had trouble finding these in my local grocery store. I ended up buying a flavored creamer, which I did not want.  The price was about $4 for a 12 ct. box. This deal was a great price and they will last a few months. TL;DR Awesome value"
"My dogs love the busy bone, and especially loved this flavor/texture of gnawhide ring. Great idea to keep the pups occupied and happy. TL;DR My dogs loved these!"
This is a great gluten-free treat! The taste and texture is just what it should be for a ginger cookie. We enjoyed them very much. Too bad they are so expensive. TL;DR Delicious!
If you are in to flavored teas this product is excellent. Just the right amount of raspberry flavor but not too much. TL;DR Delicious raspberry tea.
"I've lost 160 lbs so far through diet and exercise and am always on the lookout for low-carb, low-fat, high-protein foods.  This cereal fits the bill nicely.  It doesn't taste like Grape Nuts (which is fine with me since I don't really like Grape Nuts) and it's not break-your-teeth hard, either.  It looks (and tastes) like toasted TVP.  I wonder if I could just buy TVP and toast it myself?  I'll have to try that sometime.<br /><br />I like to mix it half and half with Kashi Go Lean original flavor with my Greek yoghurt and berries.<br /><br />Update:<br />Now I don't bother with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E05G"">Kashi GOLEAN Cereal, 14.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and just do the nutlettes with Greek yoghurt and fruit. TL;DR Can't beat the nutritional profile..."
I really enjoy the mandarin orange spice tea.  It just makes my mouth happy and my tummy soothed after drinking! TL;DR Mandarin Orange Spice Herb Tea
"This is a great coffee. I have tried many, many kinds for my Kerug... this one is a nice balance of rich flavor. It's a great coffee for everyday... if you are looking for something that is good and not too expensive this is it. TL;DR Great Coffee..."
I wasn't extremely happy with the blueberry taste but they are ok....I would not purchase again.  Guess I'm happy with just the plain mini-wheats... TL;DR blueberry mini-wheats
"This tea makes a full bodies, robust cup of tea.  Just my cup of tea!<br />Highly recommed this tea if you enjoy a strong cup of black tea. TL;DR lovin' it"
"I think these new Mocktails are clever...a low calorie (5 calories per 8 oz serving) taste of some of your favorite drinks sans the alcohol (but who says you can't jazz them up yourself?).  I've tried two of the flavors, Mojito, which was my favorite and the Appletini flavor.  Both I liked, but the apple one didn't have the green apple bite I had expected, so I might make that one with a little less water to pump up the flavor a tad.  The color was just one notch down from day-glo....quite bright, which I hadn't expected, but that was ok with me.<br /><br />Overall, I would buy the mojito one for sure, and might purchase the appletini flavor.  Each container has five packets, that each make up 2 quarts of drink mix.  A nice thing to make up if you are trying to get your liquids in but aren't keen on drinking a lot of sugary and calorie laden sodas. TL;DR good, but mojito flavor is better...."
"I love Earl Grey tea, but I'm trying to avoid caffeine. I was happy to find the Twinings Decaf Earl Grey tea, because locally I can only get herbal tea K-cups if I want to go caffeine-free. I have had the Twinings brand Earl Grey tea (with caffeine) in both tea bags and in a Tassimo T-disc. The K-cup version of their Earl Grey tea seems to have a much stronger bergamot taste than the other versions. I like my tea on the weak side, so I brew on the 10 oz. or 12 oz. setting - even so, the bergamot taste is still very strong (almost too much). If you are looking for Earl Grey K-cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow brands - they are better. If you are trying to avoid caffeine, these will give you more options and although not great - they still make a decent drink. TL;DR Not bad, just not great."
I have been buying this dog food for 6 years now. I feel good about giving my dogs a high quality lower cal food .I researched a LOT of dog foods. This one came out on top for me. And my dogs love it! TL;DR the ultimate dog food
"This is by far the best gum I've ever tasted.  I am addicted to it....in fact, when I feel like something sweet late at night, I just pop in a few pieces and my sweet tooth is satisfied.  And it is good for you, prevents cavities, what could be better? TL;DR spry spearmint xylitol chewing gum"
"A reviewer said that this tasted like Jolly Rancher green apple candy, and they are dead on right about that. This drink mix is so good. I don't like it as much as the Mojito, but it is eons better than the margarita. I hope Crystal Light puts these out in single serving packets. I'll buy them by the box load if they do. TL;DR This is so good"
"I really love this brand of coffee, I am a coffee nut and enjoy drinking this, it is nice and smooth and great tasting you can not go wrong with this choice. TL;DR I love this brand of coffee"
"This is a review of Izze's ""Sparkling Blakberry"".<br /><br />When I was younger I would often try mixing fruit juice with seltzer.  We always had a lot of both in our refrigerator.  The problem for me in my 'mixology' experiments was finding a balance between the juice and the seltzer. If I used too much juice the drink tasted flat; if I didn't use enough juice the mix would not be sweet enough.  It was fun to experiment but, like roulette, the odds of finding a drink that was consistently satisfying were against me.<br /><br />Izze has taken the guess work of of the process and the result is a drink that is thirst-quenching and 'fizzy' but not too sweet.  The Blackberry I tried out does have a nice fruity taste. It is not pure blackberry but a blend that also contains grappe, apple, lemon and rasberry juice. Despite the fact that this is a blend, the result does have a berry-ish flavor.<br /><br />On the plus side: I do like carbonated beverages, including soda and I liked the fact that this drink had the carbonation I like but did not have as much suger (20g) as that found in a regular non-diet soda. I prefer a less-sweet drink with sugar to a sweeter drink with artificial sweeteners and the Izze Blackberry filled the bill.  I also liked the fact that the cans are 8.4 ounces.  I don't like jumbo drinks, I like just enough to quench my thirst.  This relatively small size works for me. I also prefer the metal packaging to glass. This cools quicker in the refrigerator and stays cool longer.<br /><br />On the down side: My only negative is the one negative side-effect of the drinks being only 8.4 ounces.  The can is narrower than your average soda can and it just does not travel well in the cup-holder of my car. The cup holder seems designed for your standards soda can or cup of coffeee and the Izze can bumped around a lot while I drove.<br /><br />All in all I very much enjoyed this Izze product. It was tasty wihtout being too sweet, the balanace between the jucie and sparkling water is a good one, and it quenched my thirst. TL;DR Refreshing, not too sweet, convenient size"
"My husband is gluten and lactose intolerant, he always gets reactions from this because of the buttermilk powder in it. I wish there was a version without it then it would be perfect. TL;DR Good mix, but..."
"WOW, I gave it to my son to try and it was gone within SECONDS. Then he goes, ""Mommy, can I have more?"" and I had to then go out and buy some more of these great cookies. I was very impressed with the packaging and how SOFT the cookies really were when you opened them and the flavor that they had. Very Impressive. Would definitely buy! TL;DR Quaker Soft Oatmeal Cookies"
AWESOME!!!  This product is exactly what it says....THE BOMB!  Great taste!  Just a bit on the sweet side.  Just add some lime juice and you have the perfect treat! TL;DR Strawberry Smoothie Revieew
"Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment.  The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids.  To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is. TL;DR illy issimo cappuccino"
"What a colossal disappointment this new Ovaltine is.  I grew up on the original Ovaltine as did my kids.  My husband and I still enjoyed a cup of hot Ovaltine on cold nights.  But, NO MORE.  This new formula leaves an aftertaste and has more of a sweet icky taste.  Bring back the original! TL;DR New Ovaltine Formula"
A friend brought these when he came to visit from Belgium they are so delicious that I'm ordering more.  Literally the best chocolate i have ever ate. TL;DR Amazing
"After trying a number of infant formulas, my daughter seemed to digest this the best.  We used this formula until she was 11 months when she was completely weaned. I refuse to believe anyone that says that breast-fed babies are healthier than bottle-fed babies. My daughter never got sick (and I mean not at all, not ever!) until she was 21 months old!  That's a pretty healthy baby with a good immune system!  Her pediatrician even said we ought to do a case study showing how healthy a bottle-fed can be!  I am pregnant again and definitely plan to use this formula again! TL;DR Great Baby Formula!"
I buy this coffee at home and it is great.  So when we needed coffee at work and they where tired of the old coffee I suggested Eight O'Clock coffee and everyone loves it.  Can't go wrong with Eight O'clock coffee in my opinion. TL;DR A Fan for Life
"I don't usually drink decaf, but tried a variety of them when I needed to drink decaf for awhile.  This one was so good that I'm still drinking it!  No burned or bitter aftertaste, just smooth and mellow coffee flavor.  It's my favorite K-cup. TL;DR Very smooth and mellow coffee"

"The product came well packed and it was shipped and received promptly.  One can't find the ""old fashioned"" malt beverage very easily and I much prefer it to the kinds found in the stores in Tulsa.  It's a product I hope will be around so I can continue to order it. TL;DR Ovaltine"
"This is an outstanding product I live in Nothern California and have searched all of the supermarkets in my area looking for thin pretzels.  I could not find any.  I found the ""HK Anderson Salty Stix"" at Amazon.  These are exactly what I wanted.  They are very thin, crunchy, and salty.  Im very happy that Amazon sells these pretzels when I run out I will buy more.<br /><br />HK Anderson web site claims to sell thier pretzels at Costco.  I found that they do sell peanut butter filled pretzels at Costco but not the ultra thin ""HK Anderson Salty Stix"".<br /><br />I am getting low and will place another order with Amazon soon.<br /><br />Regards<br /><br />3589 TL;DR Thin Pretzel Review"
"I really liked this drink.  It provides the pleasure of a carbonated beverage without the sickly-sweet, sticky feeling that drinking a soda leaves behind.  Despite containing apple and grape juice, it tastes mainly like the orange and tangerine it advertises.  If you're looking for a carbonated juice, I'd definitely suggest this.  I'll be drinking it again. TL;DR Great Alternative to Soda"
"I've got hair that on a bad day has the texture and attractiveness level of tiny feathers, completely uncontrollable and lacking in body and focus.  As a result, I've got a pile of shampoo and conditioner combos stacked on my tub shelf.  Most make my hair feel waxy.  Some dry it out even worse than I thought possible.  A couple do nothing for the body but smell really nice.  Naturally I had to try Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty volumizing root boost nourishing shampoo.  I did not have high hopes.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised (still am) that it works (in conjunction with the matching conditioner) so well that I like my hair again.  The shampoo feels silky in use and leaves my hair the same way but with a subtle added body boost.  Nice fragrance, rinses clean quickly, removes the tons of product I tend to lavish on my locks to cement them into place, and my hair looks really good all the time.  Woo-HOO!<br /><br />I've only been using this product for about a week, but I look forward to even better results as time goes by. Definitely worth a try. TL;DR Finally!"
This is a great product. I usually order this about 3 times a month. It helps with that queasy feeling during chemo sessions and any other time he is feeling a nausea feeling. TL;DR Queasy Drops
"After Solid Gold changed their formula and compromised the product, I switched my dog to Orijen. This is the best food on the market right now in my oppinion. My dog loves it. Champion foods doesn't outsource their product which gives me peace of mind that my dog is actually eating what the label says is in the bag. The food is expensive, but the food is worth the cost. I suggest putting your dog on the Orijen rotational diet. Buy Orijen. TL;DR My Dog Loves Regional Red"
"I love cheez-its and using Amazon's Subscribe and save I save a good amount of money every month having 4 boxes delivered to my home automatically. I eat Cheez-its like they are going out of style so went with the reduced fat to try and lesson the effects of the habit. Great tasting, always fresh. TL;DR Cheez-Its are always great!"
"I eat this for breakfast 3-6 days a week. Like ""GrapeNuts"", this cereal stays crunchy for a long time in liquid.  Unlike the fore mentioned cereal, it's rice only and it can be crushed for use in crumb crusts or as a substitute for breadcrumbs. I love it. TL;DR Stays crunchy through anything"
"Absolutely Wonderful, great snack!  Once you try them you can't put them down, they will leave you wanting more and more.  No more Potato Chips, Corn Chips, or any other chips needed or allowed in my house.  Only Gold Nuggets!!! TL;DR MS"
This item is the best for bread machines. Quick and efficient rise. If you need to make a bread I advise you to use unbleached flour and this brand yeast! TL;DR Excellent Product
"The fact that it is organic is why I purchased it. The taste is somewhat bland, but the real kicker is that it is LOADED with commercial salt....not sea salt mind you.<br /><br />One serving (there are 4 per package) has 230mg! I don't eat that much commercial, overly processed, white table salt in a month! In fact, I get my Himalayan pink crystal salt from Amazon....and this stuff not only tastes great, it is a wonderful food for the body.<br /><br />Serves me right for not checking closer into the ingredients. TL;DR Will Not Buy It Again"
This is the only catnip my cats like. I have tried other kinds and not one of them shows a bit of interest and I have 5 cats. With this catnip my cats chew through the bag to get it. My husband put the bag on the shelf and 3 hours later it was all over the living room. They can seriously sniff it out from a mile away. We now have to keep it in a drawer. I highly recommend this product. TL;DR Best out there
Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita provides a 4 pack each worth a pitcherful of a margarita tasting non-alcholic drink.  The taste is actually better than some of the mixes I've had for the alcholic variety but is inferior to a well made version of the real thing ... but who would expect that anyway?  It makes a refresing drink for a hot summer day and there is the possiblity of adding something for some kick but I haven't tried that yet.  I would advise mixing well as it can have a slight graininess otherwise.  It does give a good alternative to lemonade and iced tea for a non-carbonated beverage. TL;DR Tasty and Refresing
I was soo craving some cornbread dressing to go with my turkey....I thought I would have to give it up. I knew I liked Pamela's products and took a chance and bought the 6pack on here. It was SOOO great! I am the only one who needs gluten free and sometimes my friends complain about foods I make or can tell right away that it's GF. NOT WITH THIS MIX!!  I waited until dinner was almost complete and asked if everyone was satisfied and if everything tasted like it should....they all said it was amazing! That's when I told them the cornbread dressing was GF and the gravy was as well since I used Pamela's baking mix to make the gravy!!<br /><br />The other day I was making chili and told me husband how nice it would be to have some cornbread with it. In NO time he whipped up a mix and it made a dozen muffins.<br /><br />We are not used to sweet cornbread so I did not put the sugar in the dressing...but we tried half of what was suggested in the muffins and they were good too.<br /><br />I feel like I got a part of my life back and am able to enjoy the things I love to eat now. So happy!! TL;DR AHHH-Mazing!!
This coffee to me did not live up to it's name. I was expecting a lot stronger coffee. My husband loved it!! Not watery just a little too mild and mellow for me.  No after taste. TL;DR coffee lover
These bars taste similar to most granola style bars. They would be more worthwhile if they did not have hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils or undefined natural and artificial flavorings. TL;DR Nothing special about Special K bars
"This noodle is a true, Italian pasta.  It is a noodle best used in dishes like, chicken and noodles.<br />It has a super, ""hold up"", quality.  It will absorb flavor, yet, remain independent and nice.  It has a beautiful texture and color.<br />It is something, ""other"", than the heavy,  It is not the  American farm style and good for a change.  This noodle is also  different<br />from traditional pastas, like spaghetti.  It holds its own and is perfect as a side dish with fish and  a green vegetable.  As a side dish,<br />we serve it with butter and salt and pepper.  Yummy and hard to find.  It puts the grocery store egg noodles to shame.  They are<br />bland mush in comparison, TL;DR Best, best egg noodles"
"Not only were these olives WAY too salty (yes, I did soak 'em for forty eight hours to remove the sodium) but they were also lacking in olive flavor. After soaking most of the salt out all that remained was the nasty vinegar flavor. Olives should NEVER be cured in vinegar!<br /><br />These olives were also pretty soft and mushy. I guess for folks who don't have any teeth and hate the flavor of olives they would be just fine.<br /><br />NT TL;DR Nasty"
"I bought this soup in the store and as a HUGE fan of Tom Kah soup and Amy's products, I was seriously disappointed with this version. The broth is not as flavorful as the Tom Kah soups I've had before, and the tofu is kind of hard/rough so the textures do not meld well. Definitely pass on this one- her others are wonderful though!<br /><br />Pros<br />- Similar to Tom Kah soup<br />- Shiitake Mushrooms that are in it are good<br /><br />Cons<br />- Veggies have mush in your mouth canned texture<br />- Broth is oily, thin, and weak in flavor<br />- Tofu is rough and crumbly TL;DR Kind of Gross"
These ribs splinter terribly into small sharp pieces.  Took them away from my dog as I don't want to risk an intestinal perforation from these.  Very disappointed in these.  I'll stick to bully sticks from Bravo instead. TL;DR Very disappointed in Ranger Ribs
"I have a hard time finding good Kimchi. Taking time out of my busy day to find Asian Groceries that carry it and find out if their product is decent is a hassle. I discovered Mama Eun's kimchi on Amazon. com and love it. It's not cheap but it's excellent Kimchi. They ship it FEDEX next day on cold packs so it gets to your door safe and sound and refrigerated. Someone from the company called right after I received the delivery to make sure it had arrived safe and was still cold! I'm going to try their Bulgogi next! If you don't mind paying for it, their product is excellent. TL;DR Terrific Kimchi"
My kids love this snack.  My 7 year old had a pirate theme birthday party-I gave each kiddo a bag and it was a hit with both the kids and the parents.  I love it too but I like mine dipped in peanut butter (my kids think I'm wierd).  We enjoyed this product so much we have it set up on auto ship every 3 months (with 3 kids it goes FAST!) TL;DR My kids love this stuff!
The description CLEARLY states a 75 pack nad ONLY 5 ship!!  ONLY 5.  They are rip off artists.<br />Do not order from this company. TL;DR DO NOT ORDER - They CHEAT YOU!!!
"I like Indian chai tea and this teas was very flavourful, not too strong easy to work in my new Cuisinart coffee machine. TL;DR Calming and flavourful"
"I have been using a Tassimo brewer like this one made by Bosch for several years now. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001W3V88W"">Bosch TAS1000UC Tassimo Single-Serve Coffee Brewer, Anthracite</a> . I purchased mine from Tassimo Direct online. Gevalia, Starbucks, HAG,  and several other brands were my main brews. I love the convenience of the Tassimo system and easy cleanup. However, after drinking this Marley Coffee, I am now rethinking how I brew coffee. The Tassimo takes up a fair amount of counter space. You have to use the Tassimo disc coffee packs and they are limited in choices. I wish this Marley coffee came in Tassimo discs. I love it.<br /><br />I am now thinking that I will simplify my coffee station by getting rid of the Tassimo and using a french press or this Aerobie <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047BIWSK"">Aerobie AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a>. Not only can I get everything off the counter and store it in my cabinets, but I can also use any kind of coffee I want. I have an instant hot water unit that is supplied filtered water from a sediment and carbon block filter. I also already have a spinning blade coffee grinder. So I think I am going to purchase the Aerobie brewer and open up one of the Marley pods and give it a try. TL;DR Love It. Smooth, Not Bitter, Wonderful Taste!"
I was surprised.  This is a good cup of k cup coffee.  I think I liked it better than Tully's Kona. TL;DR Surprisingly a good cup of coffee
"This is simply the best ready prepared demi-glace you can buy.  I was disappointed when Amazon stopped selling this for a while, so I'm happy they brought it back.  This is a must-have for amateur chefs since so many classical sauces use it as the base.  There are a multitude of quick sauces you can make from this without the 2-3 days needed to prepare your own demi-glace base.  Worth the money if you want to make classical sauces without investing a lot of time in the kitchen. TL;DR Glad it's back!"
"I have purchased and enjoyed the Stash brand of teas for years...though never this mix of green and black chai. I was surprisingly disappointed with this blend. Can definitely taste the green tea more than I can taste the chai. For me, it's a weak blend of spices compared to what I usually enjoy in a chai. I felt confident (obviously) when placing this order of so many boxes, and wish I could exchange or return them. Been trying to doctor it up with added spices I have in the kitchen cupboard which helped a little, though decided to just give it away to friends and family who might enjoy. TL;DR a bit disappointed..."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IHWDX6"">J&D's Original Bacon Salt 16-Ounce Bottle</a> I purchased the large bottle of this, and used it a few times. It is what I would say so-so on the bacon flavor, but okay. However, my daughter read the ingredients, and we found that is has wheat in it, which is a no-no for gluten free diets. Bacon salt speaks to me of bacon flavored salt, not something made with wheat. Ergo, most of the bottle is in my cupboard, and I will not be re-ordering. Disappointed, because who doesn't love bacon? TL;DR Flavor okay - but not gluten free!"
"If you want a mild cup of tea that still has a decent aroma and flavor, this will do the trick. Wonderful for drinking with ""biscuits"" and other mild cookies or cake. Wonderful when you just want something that feels like you are pampering yourself. Good for a steambath facial, too. I steeped one bag five minutes by accident, but it still was delicate. TL;DR Delicate but still satisfying."
"Was extremely happy these arrived totally unbroken!  I make Life Saver dolls for Kindergarteners out of these mints, sometimes for Christmas and then also make them into bunnies for Easter treats.  Wasn't able to find them in the stores anywhere!  It's a shame they only come out at Christmas. TL;DR Life Savers"
"I've had my keurig brewer for a few years now yet I've not had a chance to sample several of the varieties included in this pack. I especially loved getting to try the Kahlua (pass), Italian Blend (interesting), Kona (not as good as I expected), and Parisian Nights (definitely will buy) since those have piqued my curiosity for a long time. I just never wanted to order four dozen of each of those k-cups at a time. I was also curious on how well tea works in K-cups and have decided I will stick with Stash bags for now. This is a great way to find your favorite k-cups without buying box after box. It's also great to have for guests so they can have some variety to suit their palates. I wish all of the companies that make k-cups would do this. TL;DR One of my favorite variety packs to date"
"I became accustomed to chinese green tea while on vacation to China. Drinking fresh loose leaf tea everyday was a pure pleasure so I even went to the extent of buying chinese green teas being imported. Then one day at work, I had run out and I found we had Tazo China Green Tips tea. Lo and behold, it has the same flavor, essence and aroma as the tea I had been drinking in China. The flavor is good and the tea bag seeps well, it's not as bold as the loose leaf version by Tazo sold in tins but it does the job and for the price on the bulk 6 pack of 24, it's a pretty good deal.  I buy the loose leaf version of the Tazo China Green Tips at Starbucks for under 7 dollars a box, which are actually tins. Love this tea for the convenience and being so close to loose leaf versions of the tea. As the other reviewer noted, don't seep too long otherwise it gets bitter. I like the perfect seep where it has the nutty undertones, fresh aromatic vapors. Conveniently on Amazon for a 6 pack of 24. TL;DR Good and so very close to loose leaf chinese green tea."
"If you like green tea and you like ginger, this is perfect for you.  The ginger flavor is not too strong.  Glad than Amazon has this as this variety is hard to find. TL;DR Favorite green tea"
This is not for me at all. I got it because I was told ginger is great for heartburn. This set my mouth on fire. I'd prefer something sweet. TL;DR Spicy!
I saw some negative reviews about this candy but I disagree although it is a matter of taste. I love this low sugar candy and the chocolate mint is wonderful. I have given them to many friends and their instant reaction is surprise that it tastes so good and is low sugar. I intend to purchase more as soon as I run low on this batch. TL;DR Great low sugar candy
"This product is light and more like ""old school hair food"" just not as oily/greasy. This is not something I can use regularly during the year's early Texas heat without being a sweaty and dare I say oily/greasy mess. As with the Nourishing Scalp and Hair Oil a little goes a long way so does this product. This will be more of a cool weather product for me.<br /><br />UPDATE 6/14/2012: I do not recommend using this on WET hair. A dab of this balm used sparingly on DRY hair after using the Shampoo and Conditioner will deliver good results. The product is oily, coats the hair and adds shine. TL;DR Step 4: Seal"
"I really enjoy this drink! I feel like it helps me focus better and keeps me alert without any undesirable side effects and unhealthy, useless ingredients. I wish I could find it a lower cost to make it a more regular part of my diet. I currently buy this product at Earth Fare in Huntsville, AL. TL;DR Give Energy Pear Apple Cherry, wonderful for my focus!"
"I am making coffee with a napolitan cafetera,,, taken from Napoli it really represents the true Italian taste of coffee TL;DR True Napoli taste"
"As someone who has not been able to eat gluten for the past couple of years, this chip brought back memories of my favorite - everything bagels - that I used to eat regularly. They are quite delicious! TL;DR Think ""everything bagels"""
I eat steel cut oatmeal almost every morning and I was so happy to discover this sweetener.  Just the right amount of maple flavor and not too sweet.  I'd much rather use agave than something artificial or pre-sweetened.  I'm sure it would also be delicious on pancakes or maybe even ice cream!  YUM! TL;DR Mmmm...great in oatmeal!
"I ordered this coffee and since it was tagged as for K-Cup brewers, I assumed it would be designed like a regular K-Cup packet, but it is not. It will fit in and work in a Keurig, but because of its design, it lets a small amount of sediment through while brewing, which is not pleasing when you get to the last few sips of coffee. Also, this coffee has a bitter taste, so I definitely will not buy this product again. TL;DR San Francisco Decaf OneCp for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"
"These are seitan-ish strips of un-Pollanesque wheat gluten.  I found them to be decent when chopped and stir fried into mixed vegetables, and you could reduce the broth to gravy. TL;DR Good in stir-fry"
"Mad Dog's Revenge was an awesome purchase!! I make a lot of hot things and just using habaneros it is hard to get the ""heat"" the same every time as the intensity of the peppers differ from one to the next, not so with Mad Dog's Revenge! A couple of drops from the eye dropper is the same every time, no guess work once I have a recipe down I can make the same again and again from ""hot chocolates""* to ""strabanerro jam""** the heat without any flavor change! great product!<br />*hot chocolates= 6 drips Mad Dog's Revenge/1 bag of Hershey's special dark chips<br />**strabanerro jam= 5 cups pur&eacute;ed strawberries, 6 drops Mad Dog's Revenge, 7 cups sugar 1 package pectin<br /> the only negative thing I can say about this product is that it doesn't come with an eyedropper so some product gets wasted every time. If an eyedropper were built into the lid it would be perfect!<br /><br />  Beaser Hendrix TL;DR WOW!!"
"I ordered the Golden Gate Ficus, because I wanted to watch a Bonsai develop which would grow arial roots from its lateral branches. This type of ficus will develop them, given enough humidity. When I recieved the bonsai, i was stunned, because its so much nicer than the photo. The gracefully curved trunk has a deep tan grey color, with creme colored dashes floating thru...striking. So far, only one or two leaves dropped, and that was from rushing thru the unpacking experience. If I could recommend one thing to make your Bonsai purchase successful, it would be to use 2 day shipping. The lack of sunlight is OK for a couple of days, but beyond that its so stressful for the tree. (As well as so stuffy in that box. Trees need to breathe like us.) Trees have enough problems getting used to a new home, besided adding on the stress of a long shipment. As far as leaf drop, or even bonsai death, it's mostly due to either too much watering, or lack of water during the hottest and driest days of summer. It wouldnt hurt to buy a bonsai book, to help you determine exactly HOW much water your particular plant needs. AMAZON has used bonsai books for a penny plus shipping.<br /><br />I'm beyond satisfied by my Brussels Bonsai trees---the craftsmanship in shaping, pruning and pot sellection is obvious. My ficus plant is a work of art; it demands attention the way a perfect sunset does. If you are debating which bonsai to buy, I would say buy the oldest bonsai you can afford, since the first 8-10 years is the time when the tree is shaping and growing its important lateral branches. Bonsai branch placement and pruning is tricky, best left in the hands of a traned specialist. My plant been pruned and wired into the graceful swaying boughs of an adult like tree. (The wires were removed before I got my plant, tho.) I wont have to touch it, except for occasional twig pinching, for years. Along with the excellent Bonsai tree, is an excellent clay pot. Mine has a jade crackel glaze, with dark brisque ware feet. The Bonsai trees for sale at the home supply store are placed in cheap plastic pots. Plus, you cant find the sellection in Bonsai species at local nurseries, unless you buy them here. Thats cos Brussels is the largest Bonsai Nursery in the USA. TL;DR Prettier than the Picture"
"We not only loved this mix as a pizza crust, but it has become our favorite gf dough for other recipes.  We cut the dough for donuts and fried them, then coated them with powdered sugar or cinnamon- best ever!  And the dough fried and then salted with mustard was the perfect replacement for my mall pretzels.  With garlic and butter, these were the best breadsticks.  I subscribed to 2 cases per month! TL;DR Not just for pizza"
"This nutritious bar is great for before or after workouts.  Low in sugar, high in protein makes this a perfect snack for Diabetics too. TL;DR Great for diabetics and their workouts"
"I had bought 2 bags of wood ear mushrooms and I am not sorry, its a lot probably I will be using them for the next 2 years but i like it a lot and I tend to use more than needed because the taste its so awesome. The shipping was fast and I just love the product. TL;DR Great product for the money!!!!!"
"Tastes Great, Much better than V8. Though I do wish there was a substitute for tomatoes/tomato juice in veggie drinks. Will use salt to try and bring out the veggies flavour to counter the tomato juice flavour as other review stated TL;DR Cool"
I love the popcorn and even better is the size bag. Just enough for me and my two year old to share. TL;DR Great Size
"This Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, was short on Energy.  I didn't feel more energized or refreshed when using this product.  Also the directions are to add 1 `squeeze' of this vitamin packed liquid to 8 oz of water or other beverage.  However I felt these directions were a bit vague considering it's a vitamin supplement, my squeeze might be lighter then say my husbands, and my kids would just squeeze till it stopped.  It should really have another measure for dispensing or wording like ""1 Squeeze or about 2oz"" It would only take 1 or 2 times of squeezing 2oz into a measuring cup to figure out the right amount of pressure and flow for accurate dosing/taste.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavoring was a bit fruity, but when I added a lot it got a bit mineral tasting I thought.  Over all I wasn't that impressed with this item. TL;DR Meh ..."
Bought a case to see what it was about.  I am a night owl which effects my day-to-day performance and father-related tasks.  After a can I do feel mellow and finding myself going to bed much earlier. TL;DR Good taste and relaxing
"Just the right amount of oil, just the right amount of salt. When it comes to convenience, you will simply NOT be able to beat this Pack! TL;DR Juuuuust Right"
Love Anna's cookies but ordered this many did not work. The last six boxes even though they had previously been unopen began to loose the lemon flavor and the last four boxes the cookies became limp. Will still continue to buy Anna's cookes but not a dozen at a time. TL;DR lemon cookies
"I'm buying a second of these boxes, as we've added another cat to our family.  My 11-year-old son is in charge of keeping the boxes clean, and this box makes it easy for him.  As other reviewers have said, the clumps do tend to get stuck in the sifter, and it can be messy to dispose of the waste.  However, after some experimentation, we have found the solution to both problems.  First, store the sifter in the empty pan, and NOT in the pan with the litter (when stacked, the sifter should always be in the center of the stack).  When it is time to clean the box (preferably not when there are fresh clumps, as they will break if you don't give them a little time to harden), dump all the soiled litter into the second pan with the sifter in it (if any clumps are stuck to the bottom, it is easy to knock them off).  Then, lift the sifter to remove all the waste.  Slip the whole sifter directly into a cheap 10-gallon wastebasket liner, and dump the waste into the bag.  Finally, remove the sifter from the bag, put it into the newly empty pan, and place under the pan that now contains the litter.  The whole process takes my son about two minutes, and he has no problems.  He's used the scooping method before, and much prefers this box. TL;DR Works great if you use it right"
I switched to Zuke's for an alternative to Greenies. My dog threw them up in little chunks that resembled pebbles. Doesn't seem very digestible. I am returning them. TL;DR Made my dog sick
"At first sip, I thought these would be great for my wife and I, but the bitterness and weird aftertaste have led me to donate these to the workplace fridgerator at work. TL;DR Not very good..."
"I've bought Sugar Daddys a number of times over the past years, each time being so  disappointed with the consistency and flavor. When I've called the Tootsie Roll company Customer Service, they've told me there's been no change in the recipe and that they're made the same as always.  Unfortunately, that representative never suggested it might be an issue of FRESHNESS! I ordered a box of 24 suckers in late June 2010 through DAB Nutrition on Amazon, and have been blissfully happy since they arrived.  It is the same rich caramel flavor I remembered.  So, be sure your sucker is fresh or else you'll have a crumbly, poor quality experience!  Arrived quickly as requested. No problems. Thank you! TL;DR PLEASE, NEVER CHANGE!!"
I LOVE THE TART FLAVOR OF THIS PRODUCT.  I HAVE PURCHASED IT  MANY TIMES. TL;DR SUGAR FREE LIFESAVERS
"This stuff is amazing.  I am getting more for myself and to give as gifts.  You can put it in salad, on crackers or eat it right out of the jar.  Yummy Yummy TL;DR Skillet Bacon Jam"
"I like roast without a burnt flavor yet I like a bold cup of coffe.  This has a great balance between the two.  It is a full rich blend with only a very mild hint of a very mild burnt aftertaste.  Hardly noticeable at all but still there in the background.  However, it does not detract from the full rich flavor of this cup.  If you are looking for a milder cup of coffee I would suggest <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K"">Timothy's World Coffee Kona Blend K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> TL;DR Bold, rich, dark roast great taste"
We have a English Mastiff that likes to chew our oak bannisters.  Every other chew toy was destroyed and digested (which scared me) in half a day.  These Galileo Bones truly last.  I recommend for anyone desperate for a toy that they want to last more than one day! TL;DR Super Strong... Lasts Long
Good tea - great price - quick delivery.<br />This group listens to the people - unlike the US government to its populace. TL;DR Tea party
"For ease of preparation, for wonderful flavor, for great texture, this is the best mix I ever used.  I normally never, ever use mixes because I'm such a purist:) I order the six-pack so I can give some as gifts!  I do add just a teaspoon of real vanilla and it makes it a little more exciting!  But, I'm just being fussy...this is the real deal and the price is great! TL;DR wonderful waffles"
"Most of the fiber bars I've tried don't do the trick.  This is my favorite so far.  Chewy, sweet, right amount of chocolate. TL;DR Yummy, as far as fiber goes."
"If you like light battered shrimp, veggies and fish fillets this batter is the way to go. You can adjust the thickness by the amount of ice water you add to the batter. Buying it by the case from Amazon keeps from having to scour the grocery stores aisles looking for it. I have beeen using this batter for many years and find it the least absorbing of grease. TL;DR Excellent Results"
"My cat hated this food , at least I  think she did  because she would not get<br />near it.  I tried two different cans and she would not even<br />try it.  I agree with her that  it smelled terrible, not a smell<br />I want in my house.  Gave her a can of her favorite food,<br />Elegant Medleys White Chicken Florentine, which was gone<br />in a few minutes. TL;DR My cat hated this."
"On the back of the package there is a recipe for milk chocolate chip cookies.  It's pretty much a standard recipe ( looks the same as the one Nestl&eacute; has on their site). My favorite dessert is these cookies hot out of the oven.  Although this recipe would be good with just about any chips, I think it tastes best with these ghirardellis.  The milk chocolate is velvety smooth and has a real milk, cocoa and cocoa butter taste.  The milk chocolate isn't too light or too dark.  Bake a batch and enjoy! TL;DR Best tasting milk chocolate chips out there"
Have selected this coffee several times from Amazon because it is perfect for my tastes. Can't see any reason to change. No problem with timing of delivbery TL;DR Good Coffee
Some of the pop rocks must have been sitting around for a while.  Some of the packs where hard and not so poppy. TL;DR Some hard packs
"I use caster sugar in my sangria and margaritas since it is finer and dissolves better in cold liquid than regular sugar.  This is great, just a fair warning that 2 3-pound jars will last forever so make sure you have room in your pantry! TL;DR Great margarita and sangria sugar"
"The first time I tried this tea, I absolutely loved it.  The taste is amazing and it's hard to believe there is no sweetener in this.  It is that good.  I think I had three cups of it the first time I tried it.  The next morning, my kidney's felt really sore, I don't know if it's something to do with the cleansing aspects, but I did cut back.  I'll have one now once a week, but wish I could drink it more, it is that good tasting.  Only three stars because of my kidney reaction, but otherwise great! TL;DR great tasting tea - but maybe i drank too much"
These are really good peanuts.  The best I have had.  They are fresh and delicious.  They are not too greasy and have just the right amount of salt.  I like them very much! TL;DR good peanuts
"Wow, this is tasty and tender. I love the sauce it was in. I thawed and baked - no microwave. My only complaint is that its small which means no left overs :-( TL;DR No freezer burn for me!"
"There are 5 granola bars in each box. Those these are chewy, as advertised, they're also very dry. So a dry chewy, if that makes sense. There is a definitely cocoa flavor...more of a dark chocolate/straight cocoa than your traditional chocolate/milk chocolate. I like the chocolate flavor, but it's not something I'd eat if I was craving chocolate, because the chocolateyness is very light, and the texture doesn't lend itself to that sort of craving. I like superdark chocolate (Like the 90% cocoa stuff), and that's the flavor this reminds me of. If you're a strictly milk chocolate person, maybe pass on these.<br /><br />The ingredients list on this is pretty good looking with no strange stuff. The star players are cocoa, who gran oats, soy nuts, and almonds. Apparently, the unique kind of cocoa used means that each bar has more antioxidants than a cup of green tea, which is cool if you're into that sort of thing. The fairly high protein and dietary fiber amounts mean it does keep you full fairly well, so this is a good snack or lunch dessert to get you through the rest of the day.<br /><br />calories 180<br />cal from fat 40<br />total fat 4.5g<br />saturated fat 0.5g<br />trans fat 0g<br />cholesterol 0<br />sodium 60mg<br />total carbs 26g<br />dietary fiber 3g (very good!)<br />protein 4g (not bad)<br /><br />{EDIT 3/4/2012} So I find myself going back to these again and again during the day when I need a snack. I REALLY like them. I came back today hoping to see a subscribe and save option (I used to get a certain flavor of Clif Bar that way, but it's not available any more and I thought this would be a good substitution). Unfortunately there isn't one, but I still may purchase these form time to time. I had a Fiber One bar the other day and it tasted soo sweet. I much prefer the dark choclately flavor of this bar to the sugary taste of the Fiber One. Also the Fiber One bars are small, but this is fairly substantial and takes more than 2 bites to eat, which is nice. I hope these stick around! TL;DR Really like these!"
This coffee is great but the online price is inflated. I bought a 34 oz can at public for 12.00. TL;DR Great coffee but cost is too high
"At first they didn't take to the biscuits, but now they are there treat cookies...!  They work about 95%, so far. TL;DR Our dogs love them.....!"
"Despite not liking a lot of salt, I have an occasional craving for chips and salt & vinegar is a favorite variety. These are the best of the bunch, period. As a previous reviewer has noted, the use of malt vinegar gilds the lily that happens to be an already excellent chip--thick, crunchy, golden, and just salty enough. Pucker up and enjoy (but try not to become addicted). TL;DR None Better"
"I added MIO Liquid Enhancer to a 16.9 ounce of bottled water and took a sip, my first impression.  Smelled like peach.  Tasted like peach.  Instructions on bottle say each squeeze adds more flavor, one squeeze for each 8 ounces. So what is a squeeze?  Each person's squeeze is different.  I thought it might be a measured squeeze, so I squeezed it. Well I guess that was too much, it definitely was too sweet with over powering peachiness and left an unpleasant aftertaste that stayed in my mouth for a short time.<br /><br />I gave MIO Liquid a second try with a 16.9 ounce bottle of water and two small squeezes of MIO.  I sipped it. This time there was not enough peach flavor and there still was an aftertaste that stayed in my mouth.<br /><br />This product leaves a lot up to a person's personal taste and squeeze.  Each time I used it the results were different because each time a slightly different amount was added to the bottled water.  And even then it is still not a perfect flavor or taste.  Perhaps if it was premeasured, a chamber at the top that would fill when turned upside down with a measured amount would allow each drink to be more consistent.  Even so, this would not improve the aftertaste, Lipton and Crystal Light taste much better.  I will not be purchasing this product and can only give it one star. TL;DR ""Peachy, but..."""
"Yes, the tortillas were tasty, but the product is cross-contaminated with gluten.  The labeling is very deceiving!  It says: ""corn, a gluten free food"" on the label, but they blew it by using dirty equipment. TL;DR not gluten free"
"This water tastes very fresh and good, I guess because of the pH balancing in part.<br /><br />After drinking it for a while, that feeling wears off and it just feels like water.<br /><br />The label says they restructure the water... I'm not really sure water needs to be improved in this way.<br /><br />I think they would do better to further educate the customer as to why you would care that much about the pH.  And ""hydrates better"" is really a vague statement.  Better than what?  How much better?<br /><br />Anyway if you like trying different kinds of water (like my wife does) you will find that it does go down silky smooth.<br /><br />Overall I think its good, I just think that the benefits outlined are very sketchy, so I remove a star for that. TL;DR Its good water"
"Ok, let's be honest. ""Dogs will be dogs"" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're ""guilt-free""; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them ""junk food"", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit. TL;DR My Dogs Love These!"
"The Simply Bar product is absolutely fantastic--it's a ""clean"" food and therefore on my healthy treats list, tastes great and is well-priced! Thanks, Simply Bar! I like all of the flavors but anything with coconut and/or peanut butter chocolate is my favorite! TL;DR Great product!"
This tuna is so much better than any canned tuna I have eaten. It contains just the right amount of olive oil (not swimming in it as other brands I've eaten). Excellent! TL;DR Yum.
"I love honey and I often buy expensive gourmet types. I decided to try this one because ""rain forest"" sounded unusual and also because it is labeled organic. This honey met my best expectations, it has very nice texture and aroma to it. For this price, I couldn't believe it, it does taste like a gourmet honey. I disagree with one of the previous comments. This honey's taste is NOT overbearing at all. Good quality honey should have a distinct flavor (that's what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types) and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey. TL;DR great taste"
"This haggis was very good - the centerpiece of our Burns' nite feast.  Made cock-a-leekie soup & clapshot to go with the haggis.  Wonderful.  Even the 3 & 6 year old loved it!<br /><br />We were concerned we wouldn't get it in time, so expedited shipping.  Received it within 2 days of order.  Great! TL;DR Burns' nite Haggis"
"I drink a lot of black flavored teas and I have to put milk into all of them except for this tea, which has such a unique flavor to it.  Just the right touch of sweet and right touch of spice.  Truly a delightful tea. TL;DR Great tasting tea"
"Love Love Love this flavor...just as good or not better than I can make it. So easy with Keurig Brewer. Brew it and throw away...Sometimes hard to find Southern Sweet Tea, they are always out. Anyway, this is wonderful..very enjoyable. TL;DR Best Southern Tea ever!!!!"
"I never liked oatmeal until I tasted the banana bread oatmeal, I got hooked right away. I take it every morning, and it has help me lose some extra pounds. what I liked again about it is the individual packages, it makes me control  each portion, which would have been hard if it came in a big jar.<br />Quaker oats, keep up the good work. TL;DR best oatmeal"
"Holy spicy ginger BatMan, this stuff has some serious ZING! I love ginger lemon tea and LOVE ginger chews (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKX4FW"">The Ginger People Original Ginger Chews, 12 - 2-Ounce Boxes, (Pack of 2)</a> so I thought I was well prepared, not so much! I dissolved 1 packet in 8 ounces of hot water and had to dilute it a bit. If you like spicy ginger zing, this is your product! TL;DR Yowza!!"
"*****<br />Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea. Perfect!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: ""Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip.""<br /><br />It sounds quite romantic, and it tastes wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />***** TL;DR Authentic Jasmine Tea"
"The best brand of coffee, very tasty, strong and wonderful in the morning before a long work day. I wont drink any other brands. TL;DR Eight o clock"
"The carebear figurines were cute enough but only 8 were different, we ended up with 2 doubles. Also doesnt come in a cute box as pictured, just 10 bears thrown into a bag. We wont be ordering this lot again. TL;DR Cute but not impressed"
"I have always loved the Garden of Eatin' Chili-Lime chips, but these are a close second.  I also ordered the Nacho (which my kids like, but I can't eat).<br /><br />Anyway, the Guacamole chips are a great snack for long drives, but it is too easy to eat the whole bag full! TL;DR Wow!"
"I have been struggling to find ready-made mixes for my now six-year-old child ever since she was diagnosed with Celiac Disease two years ago.  I have gone through A LOT of flours, mixes, recipes and baking disasters.  My daughter also has a sensitivity to corn - there aren't many mixes or products that are free of corn (cornstarch, corn flour, traditionally-made baking powder, etc.) and this one is essentially (if not totally) free of corn.  It also produces awesome pancakes, an easy coating for chicken nuggets, a thickener in place of wheat flour for stew broth, and it totally flies under the radar of the rest of the family as being a GF mix. I stock up on the 3-pack of the 4 lb. bags now because I use it almost every day.  I've never reviewed anything before, but thought that this might actually help someone struggling with how to feed a GF child. TL;DR Best Gluten-free Pancake Mix!"
"I liked the product enough, it made a nice textured pasta and was easy to work with (much easier than white flour).  I did think it almost had a sort of ""fishy"" taste on my first batch, but not so much with my second batch.  I honestly don't know whether or not this is normal with Semolina, I had never used it before.<br /><br />As for the price, I'm assuming that price is for 4 24oz packages (not each package at 11 something), which comes out to something less than 3 dollars per, which is better than my local grocery by almost 2 dollars per, so it's a nice savings. TL;DR Good Product"
"Great price, GREAT product! I got it in the mail last week and have nearly used the whole jar as of today. I've been using it in cosmetics and a little bit of everything else. The smell is addictive! I'm going to be buying several more at a time when I place my next order. TL;DR LOVE IT!! This is the REAL deal!"
"Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bar:  Bar advertised as peanut butter and dark choco - so I was surprised to find almonds in it.  Tastes good but very hard...almost seemed old but wasn't based on expiration date on package.<br /><br />Dark Choco Cherry Cashew bar:  AWESOME and chewy. TL;DR Two diff flavors - one was awesome, one not so much."
"These almonds are very tasty with just a slight hint of truffle. I think if there was a little bit more truffle flavor to them, it would bring this rating to 5 stars. After eating a few, the salt begins to overpower the truffle essence. However, they still have great flavor and texture. I would probably buy this product again. TL;DR Very Tasty!"
"This tea is the most fabulous Earl Grey, and with white tea all the rage now for health benefits, no need to feel guilty about adding a little sugar, just make it raw cane/demerrara, because this stuff warrants high quality sugar - and add a slivery slice of Meyer lemon, while you're at it!<br /><br />The delicate mesh ""sachets"" and metal tin packaging I'd gladly sacrifice for more of the tea, but these are impressive if you're making a gift of the tea, which you definately should, if you know someone who adores Earl Grey they should be grateful! TL;DR Utterly amazing tea!"
"This coffee is the absolute best.  I found it by accident a couple of months ago and now I can not have any other kind of coffee.  It may be more expensive than some, but well worth it.  Plus, you aren't going to want to go out to Starbucks anymore!  Manufacturer ships quickly too! TL;DR The best coffee!"
"Shipping was very fast, I am a prime member. Upon arivail I opened the package. The box was well sealed and the syrup was held in place by inflated shipping packaging.None of the product leaked out. It was sealed with tape and also had a saftey seal between the lid and the product.The taste was very good. I plan on ordering again soon. TL;DR Taste great"
"Meat imitations can taste awful, but not this one! Very delicious.  I haven't had it in a long time because it's a bit out of my budget, but I sure miss it.  Everytime I pass it at the grocery store, I always look at the price, hoping for a sale.  Makes a great quick meal.  Goes great with leftover rice. TL;DR Very delicious and practical!"
"We haven't found something that is a must have for burgers before.  This is my favorite spice for hamburgers.  It makes them taste better than 99% of the burgers you can buy even at great restaurants. Just use fresh ground beef and the burger rub. It makes burgers taste like what you imagine a perfect burger would taste like.  Its too bad, it seems like it is being dicontinued 'cause we can't find it anywhere but here.  I guess it just didn't catch on.  Yes, it comes out clumpy(when it gets old), but sometimes even the ones from the store come clumpy.  Break the canister open, break it up, and store it in a baggie; its just spices. TL;DR Makes the best burgers"
"I was a bit hesitant to buy this tea due to the low price. But, the truth is that this is some very high quality tea at a bargain generic price.  We have spent 3 or 4 times as much for bags of less quality.  This tea has excellent flavor and aroma, perfect for a good, strong cup of tea.  I've also noticed that this tea brews much quicker than other brands. TL;DR Truly delicious"
"For some reason Aero Bars are difficult to find in the US, but they are gaining traction. While some people say the bubbles dull the chocolate taste or that they have a difficult time with the texture, I tell them to try one of the flavored aero bars and not to expect a typical Nestle chocolate bar. They are  also softer to chew and bite into-which makes them better for some people that have a hard time biting into hard chocolate bars.<br /><br />The mint chocolate one is my favorite! The chocolate on the outside is darker and more of a dark chocolate compared to the chocolate in the other Aero Bars.<br /><br />Give them a try and be open minded-bubbles in the mint make the taste more infused and fresh tasting! TL;DR My Favorite Candy Bar!"
"I've fallen in love with other Earnest Eats Food Bars so I was excited to try out this flavor.  However, I was kind of disappointed - the taste is okay but not for me.  I found it to be too heavy on the cinnamon and while I couldn't really taste the ginger when eating the bar - it definitely left a funny aftertaste. TL;DR Not as tasty as other Earnest Bars"
"I love these bars.  Great peanut taste, great nutty texture, and the cranberries! Yummy! Only problem is that they disappeared from my local grocery store shelves and some Planters product with choclate showed up in their place. TL;DR Love 'em, but they're hard to find"
"Maybe I have gotten accusttomed to a very low salt diet, but this product made breaded chicken (and later catfish) that was far too salty for me to eat. I diluted the flour with 50% corn flour for the catfish (Swai) and still couldn't enjoy it. Normally I give unsuccessful experiments to the dogs (they seem to love whatever I cook), but I didn't think this much salt was good for them either (they would have loved it anyway).<br /><br />I question if the 'salty' flavor is really salt or some other seasoning that tastes salty. Regardless, I probably will toss out the unused product. Maybe I have gotten too accustomed to low salt diets?<br /><br />Domata's other products have been terrific!! TL;DR SALTY"
"I'm not much of a cereal eater, but have always been a fan of raisin bran.  So, I was curious about this new version.  It's delicious!  Plenty of almond taste, plus raisins, and plus these little sweet crunchy clusters.  The cinnamon flavor was light, not overpowering at all.  I had some for dinner the other other night, and it was so good I had a second bowl.  I will definitely buy this in the future! TL;DR Delicious!!!!"
"I think a lot of the coffee the Keurig makes is kinda weak, but this stuff is the way I like it! Good flavor and it's strong!!! TL;DR Pretty good stuff"
"So I have a confession to make. I don't like pina coladas...or getting caught in the rain, for that matter. They're too sickeningly sweet filled with tropical flavors built to give me heartburn. I love fresh pineapple, but when I wasn't on meds to help fight my acid reflux, even looking at one was enough to send me into heartburn agony for a few hours. But now I can indulge and it's wonderful! Anyway, yes, I don't like pina coladas because of the creaminess as well, so I'm glad they released a pineapple matcha as well as a pina colada matcha. Pineapple I can definitely get behind. We love pineapple in this house, my wife spent some time in Mexico and fell in love with them there. We even have one of those pineapple corer/slicers, a big piece of $10 equipment with a single purpose that I refuse to live without.  I am very excited to be trying this matcha and I'm praying it will help feed in to that pineapple addiction we've found ourselves with. Maybe I'll try it swirled together with some strawberry matcha...I love the taste of pineapples and strawberries together.  Or any of the berries, for that matter. They just balance each other out so beautifully.<br /><br />So after a bit of mental back and forth, I decided to give this one a go. Pineapple can be done well in teas, so hopefully this one will live up to expectations. When I first mixed it up, my wife could smell it from across the room. ""That has to be bubble gum or cotton candy."" Nope, just pineapple! It does smell very sweet. At first sip, I'd be hard-pressed to find pineapple specifically, more of an overall tropical candy flavor with a touch of a medicinal aftertaste, like chewable baby aspirin. But in the aftertaste, the taste that lingers on your tongue, I found pineapple. Yum, yum, yum pineapple. I'm not too sure of this one, I'm going to have to try it with strawberry, but it's got all of the sweetness of pineapple and none of the tartness that makes it so good. I don't think this is one I'll be stocking up on, but I don't think I'll be forcing it on my friends either. I won't have any trouble finishing it, but I doubt I'll get more. Still, I am grateful to have been granted the chance to try it! I just don't think I'm enough of a tropical fruit fan to fully enjoy it. TL;DR If you like..."
"I received my Kraft Grey Poupon Bistro Sauce and it was already out of date. I called the manufacturer to find out what the date code meant...and it seems that the product that I received was already out of date by 3 months.<br /><br />Date code on my Bistro Sause was 07M2402 meaning 07 is July, and 24 is the day of the month, and 02 indicates 12 for 2012...so again my product was best by July 24, 2012 and as I write this, it's October 22, 2012. I've had the product since the 10/21/2012...yesterday.<br /><br />The product, itself didn't taste as I remembered when we had it at our local restaurant.  But, that's probably because it's old. Kraft customer service told me to return it and not to use it.<br /><br />Here's the date code so that you can figure out your best by date.<br /><br />07M2402 is July 24, 2012 (QUICK REFERENCE)<br /><br />So, mine is going back. TL;DR Received out of date product..."
"This bar took the edge off my hunger and my sweet tooth at the same time, without upsetting my stomache. TL;DR This was one tasty cookie bar."
I always end up using a lot of this for a variety of things & this is convient for me to have on hand instead of a large quantity of small boxes. TL;DR Fantastic
"I've gotten the 3 pack a couple times now, going on my 3rd.  It's pretty good coffee.  Each bag so far has been very fresh and they smell like pure bliss as almost chocolatey aromas hit your nose when you open the bags.  Each bag is very consistent too which is hard to find with coffee sometimes. TL;DR Great coffee"
I drank this coffee at the grand casino biloxi and knew I had to have it. its great at any price but especially at amazons lol. the whole bean is also great since I dont grind it until I am ready to brew. you should try this if you like great coffee TL;DR great tasting coffee
"These noodles are some of the tastier instant noodles you can get.  You can get better in the restaurant, but for 4 minutes in a pot at home, you can't do much better.  HOWEVER, and this is a big however, a six pack for $16 is ridiculous.  I hope this is a typo because you can buy these individually from a store for about $1.50 each.  These here are heavily overpriced. TL;DR Good, but pricey here"
"As someone accustomed to Lipton and other crappy black teas, I'm giving this 5 stars. The flavor is subtle, and not at all bitter. The preparation was easier than I anticipated: I didn't need to filter out the leaves, as they managed to stay in the bottom of my cup. Anyone who thinks black tea is bitter and disgusting should try this. They'll be pleasantly surprised. TL;DR smooth and mild"
"These cookies come individually wrapped and easy to stash in lunch boxes, picnic baskets, or give to the kids as an after school snack. However, I did not find them to be the most appetizing thing in the world - especially as an adult who is used to low cal or sugar free snacks. Kids hate them. I couldn't get mine to try more than one bite. Even as an oatmeal cookie, they aren't that good. We found them salty and bland. Yes they were soft, but also crumbly, which made a mess. I wouldn't say they are the worst I've ever tried, be definitely not as good as other Quaker products. TL;DR Eh?"
"It may not be fair for me to review this.  I sent it out to Uncle Johnny just yesterday.  But when I think about it, that box of dried fruit and nuts can't be all that big, and certainly not worth $70.  But somehow that's what my total came out to by the time I was at the end.  I think it was the shipping that did it.  I love my uncle Johnny, but that really hurt.  I found something that looked nice and was in my price range and then once I click ""submit"" I got a total of $69.+!!!  I was LIVID!  And I can't help but muttering to myself over and over now- if I'm going to give out $70 to someone as a gift, I certainly want them to get $70 worth of something.  So, I guess in the long run, it's not the product I'm reviewing, it's the shipping scam.<br />And these businesses who started with a wonderful idea, have turned our sympathies to just that- A SCAM.  I can not longer support them.  I'm out.  There are other ways I can say I love you, or I'm sorry your wife died. TL;DR $70!"
"i'm not a coffee expert but i enjoy a good cup of brewed joe. This is about as close as you can get, and so convenient.<br />i bring these to starbucks and buy a cup of hot water. TL;DR as good as an instant can be"
"My cats love this ! I also give them the Chicken Soup for the cat lovers soul cat food, both the wet and dry. TL;DR Natural Balance Ultra Premium Formula Cat Food"
Tea arrived on time and is being enjoyed. That's about all I can say about it for now anyway. OK? TL;DR Good tea
"I wasn't completely sure what to expect from this product, but thought it would be good for a trip to the beach or quick snack at the park.  I was very pleasantly surprised by what is in these 6 really tiny looking boxes.  The salmon actually tasted like fresh fish, with a creamy texture, which was put on  ""ritz"" like, flavorful crackers. They were pretty filling.  Also included were a bag of edamame and one of dried fruit, both a nice treat, and a piece of yummy dark chocolate.  I think that if you really wanted a full picnic  meal, you might want to add some vegetable sticks or a piece of fruit.  But it occurs to me that a great use would be on an airplane flight that does not provide a meal, as is the case more and more often, and we plan to take a few on our next trip.  There are several GoPicnic varieties and based on this item, we are going to try a few more. TL;DR this is really tasty!"
"I really like this apple cider, but I find it a bit too sweet if I make it on the middle (8-10oz) brew setting. If it's made on the highest setting it's better, but of course the taste is slightly weaker. It does have good flavor, without a lot of cinnamon.  Compared to the other brands I've tried, this one is the best, and my fave for the fall. TL;DR Yummy but a tad too sweet"
"I was so sad when I opened the first can.  It did not taste well to me or my friends.  We are thinking either the garlic is too much or it is the fire roasted taste.  My friends advised me to send my cans back, I decided to donate them to a food pantry.  Hopefully someone else will like them more than me. TL;DR Too much garlic!"
"Mickey, my toy poodle..who is overweight by the way, has been eating Beneful (healthy weight) not sure why, since he is as I stated overweight. I was trying to save this bag for when I ran out of the big bag I already have. I noticed that Mickey eats all of the soft pieces from his bowl, and leaves the others there until he is starving,so I thought why not try it out.<br /><br />Well he was excited by the bag itself..and it does look good enough for human consumption if you just look at the bag, so he probably thought it was real food, I don't think he caught the ""Chef Michael"" but maybe he did since he sometimes acts as if he can read. Anyway, he was jumping up and down and ready to eat.<br /><br />I only give him half a cup, but he munched it right up. Afterwards, I caught him going in the bag..which he never does, so I had to lock it up! This am, he was so ready to eat that he came straight in from his morning business..I didn't have to call him or hunt him down!<br /><br />I don't know if it's actually good for him..I don't read labels..sorry but from some of the other reviews..it ain't good for him! If Mickey were writing the review I think he would give it 10 stars..maybe his old food is boring. If you are concerned about the ingredients, you may want to pick another kind. Mickey is 8yrs old..so I treat him like a senior citizen and let him eat almost whatever he wants. :) TL;DR It's Canine Crack"
"I had to put my 6 month old kitten on a limited ingredient diet. There are a lot of limited ingredient and Hypoallergenic foods out there (well not a LOT, but at least options), but good look finding limited ingredient treats for cats. Good luck finding any cat treat that doesn't have chicken or chicken meal in it. These pure salmon treats were the only thing I could find, and thank goodness, my cat LOVES them! She purrs when I get out the container, and barely lets me break them up into her bowl before eating them. I usually get little salmon crumbs all over her head because she will shove her way in there...even when we open the fridge, she tries to poke her head in there to see if she can find them :) I've found that it is really important when raising a cat to be able to reward them for good behavior. Positive reinforcement is the key, and I wouldn't be able to do that without these treats. Thank you Halo! The salmon sprinkles are also great for encouraging them to eat wet food if it's not their favorite thing. TL;DR My kitty loves these!"
"Yes, this is a lot of cayenne. I was surprised to see the amount when it came in. The quality is good and it is well packed. TL;DR this is a lot!"
"This is the first time i purchased this tea.<br />I love it, its easy to make and baby loves to drink it. TL;DR good tea"
Super coffee that make having a Senseo finally worth while. Great customer service as well. The best seller of pods ! TL;DR The best
"I'd been hearing about Zevia and finally got to try some of each flavor.  Due to an inability to process sugar (can't ""cheat"" because I get instantly sick), and headache problems from aspartame and sucralose, I've been unable to drink soda for several years.  I figured I'd rather be healthy, feel good, and drink water or tea than have a drink of pop and feel awful, so I abstained.<br /><br />So I was excited to find Zevia.  Zevia is nothing short of wonderful.  When I could still drink pop, I'd tried all kinds of artisan types like Jones, Virgil's etc. so it doesn't bother me a bit that it's not a Coke clone (but it's not far off either).  It's still got a wonderful, true cola flavor--a fantasia flavor of vanilla, citrus, and cinnamon, like all true colas.  Plenty of fizz that lasts the whole can.<br /><br />As far as aftertaste goes, I've never tasted a soda that didn't have some kind--and that I couldn't get used to.  This probably has less aftertaste than anything I've tasted, other than straight cane-sugar.  If anything it's a sweet, rather than the usual acidic, aftertaste.<br /><br />The opinions of the others in my family are similar.  My husband, who is very picky when it comes to diet cola, loved it and claimed my second can of it.  He's been trying to get away from his diet Coke addiction for a couple of years.  My kids loved all the flavors they tried. They're not normally allowed to drink soda at all, and are thrilled there is finally something out there I'll allow them to have once in awhile.<br /><br />It's selling for about $1 a can, which is less than the other ""stevia-supplemented"" soda out there (Virgil's is around $2 a bottle).  I imagine that as this takes off, that price will come down.  And it should take off.  It's just as good as the not-so-good-for-you sodas. TL;DR I can finally have soda again!"
"Excellant service and prompt shipping from this merchant.  Tea (lemongrass) was not available anywhere we shopped, but found it online at this merchant.  Wife really likes the tea.  Recommended merchant. TL;DR Lemongrass Tea (individual bags)"
I finally found something tiny enough to use as a male pleasure toy. They also leave a super tingly sensation on my male part... oh yes. TL;DR Oh finally.
"Product arrived in an envelope within a week, and all seemed good. Upon opening the envelope what fell out was alarming. The square Jaffacakes box had apparently been opened by somebody with a knife on one end, and the orange packaging inside of the box that contained the cookies was a smear of chocolate and crumbled cookie matter. Not sure if I want to try to consume something that has obviously been tampered with to some degree. Too bad because I was really looking forward to trying these. TL;DR I'm scared to even eat these"
"With the advent of the internet, it's very easy to get your hands on salt water taffy without having to be near a coastal city, state fair, or theme park.  While there's no substitution for freshly made taffy, the next best thing is purchase a souvenir box of salt water taffy, and the Fralinger's brand sets the standard for all boxed taffy.<br /><br />Two important things to know about taffy, outside of flavor, is its stickiness and softness.  All salt water taffy is sticky; however, if stored in a cool environment the taffy becomes more manageable and easier to unwrap.  With the Fralinger brand, room temperature should be adequate enough so that the taffy doesn't stick to the wrapper.  The softening process is a very important process when making taffy as it requires proper folding and stretching of the candy.  When dealing with softness you should not be struggling to eat or chew too heavily as to allow the taffy to get stuck in your teeth; these are signs of poorly made taffy.  This brand strikes a good balance between softness & elasticity, making it very easy to chew.<br /><br />Of all the salt water taffy I've encountered, I still find myself enjoying Fralinger's.  The flavor itself is robust enough without being over powering, nor is it too subtle to where you can't taste a difference in flavors.  For price comparison, I typically find the 12 oz (~0.75 lb) box for around 6-9$ at specialty candy stores or air ports, both notorious for over pricing, but again this is not an easy product for many people to hunt down.<br /><br />For those who are curious, there is no actual salt water in salt water taffy.  The Fralinger brand is the first salt water taffy brand to manufacture and sell the product.  To my knowledge the original stand/store is still operational to this day making its taffy in Atlantic City's boardwalk. TL;DR The standard for salt water taffy"
"Our entire family love these.  We are not fond of the other flavors, but the vanilla is a hit! TL;DR Love these!"
"This stuff is simular to flavored Coffee Mate (the power kind), yet it rivals it, and some of the other private brand verions. TL;DR Simular to flavored Coffee Mate."
"I like that this bag is well sealed on all sides. The double ziplock is easy to close. I also like that there is lots of room above the level of liquid because I like to squeeze the air out before I seal the bags.  The only drawback is that they don't stand well once I put the liquid inside, they tend to flop over with 4oz or more of liquid.  Which may not be a concern if you place the filled bags in a box, container or organizer or if you lay them flat in the fridge or freezer. TL;DR Leakproof but doesn't stand up"
This product is very good.  The 1.5-ounce jars are perfect portions for cooking or individual servings. I rated it 4 because 5 jars leaked and I had to get rid of them. TL;DR anchovies
"I love Chai Tea, so when my husband bought me a Keurig for Christmas, he also bought a box of this stuff.  I'm grateful that he also bought some coffees, because this Chai is terrible.  The spices are overwhelming, and upon my initial tasting, I thought my cup must still have some dish soap in it.  I poured that cup out and started over, but with no better results. I finally realized the strange taste was probably due to the sucralose and whatever combination of spices.  But the taste is not just a little odd, it is really undrinkable. TL;DR Not good.  Very hard to drink!"
I used to have to go to Costco to find this item.  Now I can buy it online for just about the same price.  Plus I don't need someone with a membership to let me into the store.<br />I eat this for breakfast every day and prefer it over the instant oatmeal since it's less processed and seems to satiate me for longer. TL;DR Great value
"These looked so good, but the sugar free product is very laxative, so eating more than one can be a mistake.  I can't recommend them, and I don't plan to buy more. TL;DR Not good"
"We have tried numerous recipes, but this makes the best Gluten Free bread yet in my opinion.  I love the sweet bread recipe also. TL;DR Best GF bread we've found yet!"
"When I purchased it, the price was close to $22.00. Now it's way to high and I had to chose another brand that is $25. The tart cherry juice works fine, but I won't be purchasing this brand. TL;DR It's good, but it's too expensive."
"Every evening includes a cup of Bigelow decaffeinated French Vanilla Tea and if there is a movie included in my evening plans, I will enjoy two cups of this tea. TL;DR My favorite tea!"
"I tried several varieties before committing to the subscribe program and this one edged out my second favorite, the French Roast. Every batch is as good as the first and I am very happy with it.<br /><br />I'm also delighted with Amazon's subscriber program, especially since I rely on others to shop for me and this is just one more thing that I can get for myself, on my own timetable, and not have to wait until they are ready to go. Thanks Amazon! Please continue to add more quality items to your grocery service. TL;DR Excellent Coffee at a Great Price!"
"I love this product...BUT, all of the 5 out of 6 bottles ordered oozed out onto my cupboard shelf AFTER they arrived.  I got a refund for the no-beef that arrived all oozed out, but the no-chicken seals looked good.  I went to use a new one and they ALL oozed out!  I threw them all in the garbage!  The product actually pushed the jar lid up.  It's a shame because the product is fantastic.  What's wrong with the packaging? TL;DR 1 star for packaging, 5 stars for taste!"
"This bag is a perfect fit for my garbage/recycle basket.  I use the Simple Human rectangular shape receptcables.  It's great not having to dump my items directly into the garbage dumpster.  Not the sturdiest bag - don't over fill it, but the best I have found for fit.  I would purchase it again. TL;DR Fits my garbage/recycle bin perfectly"
I was very unhappy with this purchase.  This starter plant was very frail and looked horrible when I receved it.  It looked nothing like the picture.  I am not sure if this plant will thrive. TL;DR very unhappy
"I've been using these to make sprouted wheat bread.  The bread tastes great, and I know exactly what's in it.  Happy customer here. TL;DR Makes great bread"
"These are wonderful chips that really do taste like what they say, olives! If you like a very crispy thin chip packed with wonderful olivey goodness and subtle garlic then try these they are awsome! I first tried this companies products from Costco where I purchased their multi grain chips. I was hooked from the first bite and like them even better then the olive ones but they are both excellent chips. They are not too salty either which is another reason I love them. The grainy taste is nutty and a little sweet and addictive. The little bags were not enough I was left wanting more but on the other hand the little bags are safer to have around! You will love these I promise! TL;DR Great Product!"
These pill pocket treats are a life saver!  My cat was recently diagnosed with chronic renal failure and now has to take 8 medications twice a day. These pill pockets make it super easy to give him his tablet medications. We stick two of the medications in a treat in the morning and again at night. Two little tablets fit in each pocket.  The best part is that our kitty is anxiously awaiting his medication/treat when we wake up in the morning and before we go to bed. This product has really made our lives easier when coping with our kitty's illness/treatment. TL;DR LIFE SAVER!!!
"This is by far the best GF sandwich bread I've tried yet, Whole Foods makes a good one as well but for the price GF Pantry is much better.  It actually tasted like white bread.  It was moist and fluffy.  Cut it thin because it is really filling.<br />PS Pamelas GF bread mix was strange, very dense and tasted like bisquits, and Bobs Red Mill stinks of Garbanzo bean flour TL;DR Loved It!"
You can't find a better gluten-free brownie. These are sinfully rich and chocolaty. If you are not allergic to nuts - add a handful of walnuts to the mix. You won't be disappointed. TL;DR Betty Crocker Gluten-free brownies
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F0BXB0"">De Boles Pasta Corn Spaghetti, 8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br />This is one of the best tasting gluten free pastas I have had in the last five years! It says to cook for 8 to 10 minutes, but cook it for 11, its perfect!<br />I highly recommend. TL;DR Real Pasta"
"I was surprised by the fast delivery! It was estimated that it would take about a week but it came within three days.<br />I'm pretty satisfied with the product for now but that's because I just received it. The only problem I find is that my dog thinks its a real bone so he's trying to find a place to hide it. He doesn't get that it's a toy and he should be chewing and playing with it.<br />He has tried chewing it a bit and has only made some dents into it. Oh, by the way, my dog is an American Staff. so he has some powerful teeth. I'm hoping this will last for awhile.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />It has been about a month since I received this item and my dog has barely touched it. Whenever I show it to him he just ignores it or takes it and hides it somewhere (like under his bed). I'm not sure why since he loves bones but maybe he thinks it's not a toy and he should not chew on it? Or he might just not like it. I'm still surprised that he has barely touched it because he loves to chew! TL;DR Fast delivery!"
"First of all, these caramels are to die for.  Second of all, the gift is very pretty and well packaged.  No wrapping paper needed!  Very happy and have ordered them for numerous colleagues, family members and friends.  Everyone has asked where to buy more! TL;DR Fabulous Gift!  Pictures don't do it justice."
"A beach on Ko Samui. A bikini-clad waitress brings you a coconut, then produces a machete. ""Pour vous, monsieur,"" she says, bringing the blade down upon the coconut with a raunchy thwack that strangely excites you. Why did she speak French? You don't care. She unwraps a straw, and places it gingerly into the coconut. ""Merci,"" you say, confused. You didn't order a coconut. Even so, as you sip the sweet sweet milk, the sound of the waves remind you of an old lullaby, and you close your eyes, adrift in the warmth of the setting sun.<br /><br />You open your eyes. You are in your apartment in Brooklyn. Was it all a dream? You are holding a 14-ounce unit of Thai Kitchen Pure Coconut Milk. Eleven units remain--maybe it wasn't a dream, after all. TL;DR The Lullaby"
"Love this product! I substituted the butter for coconut butter--definitely not a mistake. So delicious. Adding Pamela's Dark Chocolate Frosting Mix (also using coconut butter instead of butter) makes this entire cake so delectable. It is definitely pricey online, but if your neighborhood grocery store will order it for you it goes for $4.50-$6.00. Its worth the cost though. TL;DR Yum yum!"
"I love the Coconut Cocoa tea, so I was excited to try this one, even though it was listed at about four dollars more than I paid for the other.  This was a nice cup of tea, but despite brewing/steeping at directed, I don't get any chocolate flavor from it.  I'll drink it, but won't be buying another can, especially at $10.69. TL;DR Nice cup of tea, but not worth the price"
"My smartphone accidentally ordered this item for me at 2:30 AM while I was asleep.  There was a reboot and software reload that night and I guess amazon was recommending this on my screen.  Anyhow I had it for 2 days while trying to find a post office that would accept it and take it back to amazon since *I* did not order it.<br /><br />Looking at the product, it has weaknesses.  I did not let my German Shepherd Dog play with the toy as she is pretty destructive.  The first problem I identified is that the plug that keeps the food inside and lets it dribble out at a slow rate does not secure itself well enough to prevent a clever dog from getting the plug ""unplugged"".  Basically the detent is not firm enough to hold the plug in place.<br /><br />It's also not sturdy enough for big dog roughhousing - thin wall brittle plastic construction, loose plug (which once removed will get chewed to pieces), and a small gap that will not let big dog food fall down the tube make it useless for big dogs and their oversize kibble.  The cube is pretty big (5-6"") for small dogs with 1/4"" kibble which is what it is really deisnged for.  My dog's 5/8"" funky shaped kibble would never go down the chute and would piss off the dog.<br /><br />So too small for a large dog for which it is sized, and too big for a little dog which makes it wrong-sized except for the mid size (15-30) lb dogs which would probably have a good time playing with it provided the owners make sure the plug stays in place-it rotates out too easily.  Eventually the brittle plastic will crack - depending on the dog the crack may be sniffed out as an alternate route to the food supply, and depending on the teeth the crack may become large enough to get kibble out of.<br /><br />I had already bought the LARGE KONG <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ALMW0M"">Kong Wobbler Dog Toy</a> toy and took a knife to carve out the opening so large kibble would come out ok without fustrating the dog.  When the dog knows there is food inside they will become irate, and get into trouble trying to figure a way into the food.  Pretty soon the kong goes flying, hurled by an energetic dog fustrated with getting to the treat, which is what brought out the knife to open up the hole it falls from.  Dog and Kong are doing fine now that the food comes out ok.  I don't like the food chute on the cube design - as an engineer I feel it is flawed from the beginning.  I don't really like the kong either because it screws together the top and bottom halves.  Dogs seem to understand threaded connections after a few trys even without opposable thumbs.  A good grip and bite will unscrew a kong especially with a big mouthed dog, e.g. a german shepherd! TL;DR NOT good for big dogs, plug comes out too easily"
"buy this. they are delicious. i love them. the only bad thing is that i had to pay too much for shipping, but the product is really good TL;DR delicious"
This is a product that we will use again as it was a quick way to create a drink that satisfied the need for a casual cup of refreshment. TL;DR K -Cup Cappuccino
We have been using this product for years.  It tastes good and is perfect for casseroles such as scalloped potatoes and ham. I also mix it in with garlic noodles and green beans. It is good for any receipe that needs a small amount of ham.  We have never tried it just plain by it self - only as a mix in. TL;DR Great for Casseroles
"I've been using a Senseo coffee maker for 2 years. Last year, fewer of my local stores have carried any Senseo coffee pods. Fortunatly, I am able to purchase my dark roast and decaf on Amazon through automated shipping. Once a month I get my delicous dark roast and every 3 months I get my decaf. I save time and money and don't have to worry if the supermarkets or gourmet shops even have have my Senseo in stock. TL;DR Great Coffee"
This is the only peanut butter my husband will eat. I'm thankful amazon sells it because we can't find it at any local stores. The peanut butter has a slightly sweet taste because of the honey which makes it great in sandwiches and ice cream. TL;DR Only peanut butter we eat
"After learning I was allergic to rice and barley, I was at a loss to find a substitute for my nut butter snacks.  Lost no more :)  The spelt cakes are great.  They are a bit sticky on the outside.  The sweetness is light and just right.  The flavor is a little nutty and fantastic.  A great rice cake alternative, without scary additives. TL;DR A little sticky, but YUMMY!"
"I have ordered this item in subscription last week, for the real good deal you'd get, but I fear I have to cancel that.<br /><br />I prepared it exactly according to the recipe on the package. I happened to still have a lemon curd in the pantry, so I could follow the recipe exactly. And I did everything exactly as suggested. It took about 2 hours all in all, with marinating and rice cooking and all. And it smelled really good. We love indian food, we often buy this brand (and other indian brands) brands from a store in our area. But just this item was never seen there, so I was trying something new.<br /><br />Now, was it my ignorance, or did I forget what ""Biryani"" means - I don't know, but somehow I did not remember any Biryani being so - uhm - spicy.<br /><br />We Germans call that taste ""sharp"", but in american english it is referred to as being ""hot"". I don't like ""hot"", since that means high temparature in my understanding.<br />So I am calling it spicy, but that term still is not fully covering it.<br />Many things can be spicy and not burn your mouth (not talking about hot temperature, again!!).<br /><br />But this spiciness was really too much for us.<br />I am German, my husband is American of slavic descent. We are used to spices like onions and garlic and such, but this spiciness was too much for us. I am sorry.<br /><br />This is probably a great food item for anyone who likes that kind of spiciness, and I am sure there is nothing wrong with it.<br />100% vegetarian, organic and all, really great, and such a good price! Only - we cannot handle that sharp taste. TL;DR Vegetarian, organic and all, really good, but - too spicy for Europeans"
This is a fabulous drink.  And I was so pleased to find it uses an artificial sweetener.  I tried the Keurig brand of apple cider and it doesn't compare to this.  I give this 5 stars! TL;DR Fabulous
"This was a great product and I'm very happy. The kernels are sweet and fresh and my family and friends all enjoy eating them. I had a bowl of kernels sitting out when my sister dropped by. She had eaten several when she commented ""These are interesting tasting little almonds"". I had to laugh. My girlfriend had ordered some kernels from another company but was very disappointed in the quality and taste so she asked me yesterday to order her 6 bags from Home Naturals.<br />A word of caution... don't eat too many in one sitting. You'll be making several trips to the bathroom. HA! They make for a good colon cleanser. TL;DR Crunchy Kernels"
"This oil is certainly tasty, and the teeny tiny little bottles that it comes in are very cute.  Since this was the first truffle oil that I have ever purchased, I was surprised to see that this ""truffle oil"" is really just olive oil with ""truffle infusion"", whatever that is.  There are a couple of almost microscopic truffle flakes in the bottle, but other than that, it's pretty much just plain ol' olive oil with a little extra taste to it.<br /><br />Just having it in my pantry does make me feel fancy though!  And a little goes a long way.  I really overpowered my taste buds with the intense mushroom-y flavor by trying a drizzle of this oil on a piece of good bread--I'll use this oil more sparingly in the future! TL;DR Heavy On Truffle Infusion, Light On Truffles"
"I recently bought an El Paso Chile Co. margarita machine and also wanted to lose a little weight!!  Did a search for sugar free mix and found Baja Bob's.  I've gone through about 20 packages of the powder margarita mix and love it.  It is a touch tart but I tone it down with a lite diet Sprite and it makes a perfect margarita everytime! You won't be disappointed.  I have had regular (sugar) mix since and I prefer Baja Bob's. TL;DR Great, Great Great"
"This one is extremely versatile as for flavor differences, the liquid you add can be either water, tea, or milk.  But the flavor is really mild no matter which blend you use, which is why the middle-grade for the product itself.  If you want a real snap to the mango you'd get a better one at a certain fast food chain that advertises mango-strawberry. TL;DR Versatile"
"The refrigerator cake made with these wafers, which my mother called ""Famous Dessert"" when she made it at the end of the 1930's, is what my kids renamed ""Favorite Dessert"" and it's now that for the grandkids too.  The delicate wafers themselves are dry and crisp.  Their taste seems nothing too special if you eat them straight -- but being layered and covered with whipped cream and a few hours in the refrigerator brings about an easy transformation into a luscious and intense chocolate experience.  There is no refrigerator dessert close to it.<br /><br />But today's packaging is less protective of these wafers than were the long metal cylinders with screw tops that protected those of my childhood memories. I often need to sort through the boxes on groceries shelves to find ones with no more than one or two broken wafers.  So I welcomed a chance to buy a carton. Closely packed and sent straight to me, I told myself, they would arrive intact, and I'd have a supply for many impromptu dinner parties.<br /><br />WRONG.  The unexpectedly large carton that arrived today proved to be part of a naive attempt at the double-boxing often used to ship fragile things. Unfortunately, Amazon's packer didn't really understand the concept.  The only cushioning included in the ample spaces between that large carton and the inner one with the wafers was one strip of 4 plastic pouches partly filled with air.  The inner box seemed to have been bouncing around a lot during transport, by the glimpses of the number of broken wafers in the boxes inside. I braced myself to go to the trouble of sending the order back -- I can find less damaged ones (at a lower price) on local shelves.<br /><br />And guess what?  After filling out a feedback report on the packaging problem, I went to arrange a return -- and was told that the product in that order was not returnable.  No reason given, and no warning on the listing either.<br /><br />Now I can understand that Amazon has no use for 12 boxes of damaged wafers.  But you know something?  Neither do I.<br /><br />Yes, I hope Nabisco continues to be carry them forever.  But I'll get mine locally from now on, and suggest that you might be wise to do so too. You can grate one broken wafer over the top and add an extra bit of that wonderful chocolate taste as well as a nice contrast to the white of whipped cream. But one is all it takes, not half a dozen or more. TL;DR Marvelous wafers, badly damaged thanks to Amazon's packaging"
"I ordered this variety pack to try candy made with natural flavors, and so far everything I have tried I love.  The peppermints are strong and wonderful, and the Root beer candies are great.  (Edit because I have tried more of the variety)  So far I have not come across a flavor I did not enjoy, even ones I was not sure about (pomagranet pucker?)turned out to be wonderful treats.  I do limit myself on how many I eat, but I find the serving size is more than enough to satisfy an occasional attack of the sweet tooth.  So far the peppermints and the Vitamin C citrus drops are my favorites.  I wish some of the flavors came in drops without the variety pack, or a creat your own variety, as I can have hard candy but cannot walk around with a sucker stick hanging out of my mouth at work. TL;DR What a great candy company"
"My parents are both diabetics (Type 1 and Type 2). Their blood sugar has been uncontrollable and was looking for a healthy alternative to Splenda.  Bought this last week at Whole Foods in Northbrook and it was on sale as well.<br /><br />Love the smell, but when they put it to their coffee, their blood sugar spiked 5 times the normal range.  At one point, my mom's sugar spiked to it's highest ever at 389.  She was so scared when she saw ""CHECK FOR KETONES"" on the machine.  Well, let's try baking bread and using this coconut sugar instead.  It has that same effect.  I was wondering if we could be doing something wrong.  Maybe we are using a wrong ratio to the table sugar.  My parents used the 1 to 1 ratio (e.g. 1 tsp coconut sugar = 1 tsp cane sugar).<br /><br />I really had high hopes with this product specially for my diabetic parents. I researched high and low here in Amazon and other diabetes blog sites. I have read nothing but excellent reviews of this product and other Organic Coconut Sugar.<br /><br />Please, if we are doing something wrong, let us know.  Give us some feedback.  My parents have stopped taking this and is looking for a different alternative. I read some excellent reviews regarding a product called Xylitol.  So i might try next. TL;DR Don't know what's going on..."
This product if the best stuff if your needing to get your body back on track. It is all natural and provides a lot of magnesium for a healthy body. Will be buying again. TL;DR Best Stuff for Natural Medicine
"This is very good dog food and the dog loves it.  It is worth any price that you can get it for.  This dog food is based on protein and is much better, for any dog, than other dog foods are.  Amazon ships fast and they are very fair.  We got the dog food within 5 days, which surprised us a lot.  Buy only Diamond for your dog and you will be as pleased as the dog is. TL;DR Great dog food"
"I purchased this product for my daughter with multiple food allergies.  The ingredients listed were all things she could have.  Unfortunately, the ingredients list is inaccurate.  I checked both amazon's list and the ingredients list on the company website.  Neither listed citric acid, which can be a corn derivative, but it was listed on the box when I received it.  Corn is one of my daughter's allergens, so I could not feed her this product without knowing the source of the citric acid used.  I have tried calling the company for a week and keep being told an ingredients specialist will call me back, but they NEVER do.  I have written the company via the contact us form on the website, but no one will contact me to give me the information I need to know.  Fortunately, amazon.com was very helpful and issued me a refund, but Bremner cannot be trusted if you have food allergy questions.  I am very upset at the lack of concern from this company.  Those with corn allergies or citric acid sensitivities should not purchase this product.  The ingredients list really needs to mention this!  I will not purchase any Bremner products in the future. TL;DR Company NOT allergy conscious"
"Someone originally gave me these delicious morsels as a Christmas Gift.<br />I could not believe how divine they are .  I suppose you have to be an almond fan as well as a creme brulee fan.  They are fabulous little snacks, and wonderful to put out when guests are coming. TL;DR these are heaven on earth"
"This is a very tasty tea, but you should be very careful if you are pregnant.  I decided to check the ingredients before drinking it.  As it turns out, there is some debate regarding the very first ingredient, raspberry leaf.  It is unclear whether this is safe early in a pregnancy, or whether it should only be used at the end...when trying to induce labor.  Rather than take any chances, I threw the stuff out!<br /><br />I think the manufacturer should warn people not to consume this during early pregnancy, or at least advise of the risks.  The advertising is irresponsible, in my view.  No more Yogi products for me. TL;DR Consume this Stuff with Extreme Caution"
"the coffee got here within 7 days, and I* have been enjoying it since, I would not hesitate to order from these folks again TL;DR Great Service"
"I ordered this brand of popcorn due to the rave reviews. I made several batches in my Whirly Pop before writing this review. As others have, I used Orville Reddenbacher as the standard for comparison.  Paragon was no better, and no worse. So far, the most tender and flavorful popcorn is from Wabash Valley Farms. The Wabash brand is, however, much more expensive.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Paragon is not bad, it's just very average, on par with Reddenbacher. TL;DR Unexpectedly average"
"They were smaller than I thought they would be. They taste good, but again they are kind of small.; but there were a lot of them in the 5 lb bag. TL;DR Choclat Mints"
"I've been making this Tapioca Pudding for dinner parties where some guests are Vegan or Vegetarian.<br />I've substituted the water with Almond Milk (I like Almond Breeze) and also added the Coconut milk recommended.<br />It's been a big hit. I started adding raisins to the first cook, before adding the Coconut milk.<br />Guests can't get enough.<br />Just ordered my second set of boxes. TL;DR Fabulous cooked with Almond Milk"
"I have never considered cookie as a choice for breakfast, but the ingredients in this cookie are healthier compared to other breakfast items my kid normally eats. Now, these cookies are on my breakfast menu for my kid and myself. TL;DR Healthy breakfast kids love"
"Beware, these little gems taste better than candy! The Ambrosoli-Honees Energy Plus Vitamin Caramels are not only delicious, they also give you a little boost as well. When I received them in the mail, I put them to the side. Later that night, when I was writing on my computer, I decided to give them a try. Phew, if they weren't so good, I'd only have eaten one. But I opted for two in a row because this hard energy candy tasted better than most caramels I've tried...Big mistake. I couldn't get to sleep for a few more hours, haha. Now, with that said, it isn't like the Energy Plus Vitamin Caramels are full of caffeine or other energy pepping herbs. Instead, they are full of B-vitamins. So, I cannot honestly say that my brain or body were wired wirth nervous energy, like if I downed some hard-core energy drink. It was more of a mental boost with no crashing side-effect, which is a plus. I really like them and I am going to order some more just to keep around when I need to satisfy my sweet craving. The hard candy has a soft center with a mixture of honey/caramel flavor that satisfies my craving while giving me a slight boost. Perfect combo! TL;DR Tasty and Peppy"
"This is my favorite of the product line and I use it regularly.  I do use the others on occasion, but this particular one seems to be the most effective.  All of these products are highly recommended though. TL;DR Extremely effective for t;his old guy's hair and scalp"
"Great product, roasts up nicely,  Good price compared to grocery store. This is all I use anymore. Flavor is great, smokey and chocolatey. Makes a very nice cup of expresso. TL;DR well priced, good value"
"I ended up returning this item.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you buy this item, run it through to cook pure water only, then taste and smell the water.  I got a heavy plastic smell and shockingly intense bitter taste, even after 10 cycles after buying it new.<br /><br />At first the reviews I read seemed good and the product is so cute I wanted to like it very much, and the idea of making your own food seems healthier than buying prepackaged.<br /><br />Upon opening, I noticed that the cap for the boiler looked cheap and *entirely* plastic, not like the sturdy caps on similar boilers of a Krups espresso machine of the same price range.<br /><br />But I was thrilled and ready to go, and nearly made a batch of food immediately. I'm so glad I didn't.  However the instruction booklet had an odd suggestion that when first opened new, the user should cycle water only through the machine at least three times.<br /><br />The first time (filled water to the 3 cup line, poured it in, closed the lid, and turned it on), I had a heavy plastic smell in the steam. Still wanted to like it, and figured some smell was unavoidable.  I don't know if the smell came from the plastic lid of the boiler, or the steamer tray, or the clear container.<br /><br />I ended up running it about 6 or 7 times (again water only) and the smell decreased somewhat.  I still wanted to like the product.  That's when I thought I should taste the water.  It was unbelievably and sharply and very clearly bitter.  I couldn't even hold it in my mouth for more than a fraction of a second.  I ended up running the machine about 12 times with just water, and the taste was still just as bad.<br /><br />Had I run the Beaba with food and given it to my baby, I would've chalked it up to the baby hating broccoli. In the end I figured I could run it a hundred times, and even if the smell and taste eventually faded away until I couldn't detect it, I'd still be risking giving chemicals to my baby.  After all, you can't taste BPA either, so tasting it shouldn't be my threshold.  BPA free or not, this product when run with pure water produced hot water that tasted like poison; there are other chemicals out there to be worried about after all.<br /><br />Maybe after this experience I'm not sure I would trust any product involving heat and plastic, so it's back to my stovetop steamer and Cuisinart for my baby food.  (I kept the Beaba silicone freezer tray, since silicone is inert and it works great and I love the design of the tray)<br /><br />It is possible I had a defective lot or something, so if you do end up buying this product, I recommend running it with water only and tasting it for yourself.  Trust yourself, not me.<br /><br />****Feel free to comment to my review and indicate whether you do, or do not, taste the bitterness from running water-only through a brand new Beaba unit.**** TL;DR Bitter plastic taste when run with only water. Not for my baby."
"First things first, this is magical, but only one component to fix your problem. Make sure you're got collars and sprays/topical treatment for the pet(s), too (if not flea lights like Victor) to cover all areas. If you only go with one approach, it's likely you'll be going in circles.<br /><br />I read aaaallll the reviews. Used Adams before and did well, but this seasons fleas were, apparently, ones where hell hath no fury in comparison.<br /><br />Zodiac helped make a mountain into a mole hill. We had a nightmare on our hands, and were looking at bombing as being our last and only option.<br /><br />Enter Zodiac - thoroughly sprayed on 8x5 carpet, couch, and two recliners. AS A TIP - covering all of those areas well took the entire bottle, if you're trying to gauge for your own needs.<br /><br />Thinking of keeping a spare on hand, because fleas are scary in their relentlessness, and heck knows its best to beat them at first sight. TL;DR This was a Godsend."
"THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PROGRESSO SOUTHWESTERN CHICKEN SOUP.  I HAVE HUNTED FOR THAT CERTAIN SOUP FOR AGES AND FOR SOME REASON THERE IS ONLY THE ""LITE"" VERSION WHICH TO ME LOSES FLAVOR.<br />I WILL ENJOY IT, SO THANKS AGAIN. TL;DR YUM!!!"
"It's just a can of corn.  For online pricing, this is a good deal.<br /><br />What I like about Libby's corn is that it's not quite as salty as some of the competitors.  That makes it easier to cook, because it doesn't overpower other ingredients.  Put a small amount of butter or cream in when you heat it, top with fresh cracked pepper, and it's a tasty side.<br /><br />The product is very consistent in quality and I have no complaints. TL;DR A good brand of corn"
I had been trying all the frosted animal cookies to find one that tasted like Mother's...I could not find one that came close to Mother's...I LOVE these cookies and was so excited to find them on Amazon!!!! TL;DR Best Cookies Ever
"Most energy drinks I have tried are not very good taste wise, but this No Fear drink tastes great. The energy that it provides is on par with other name brand energy drinks like Monster or Rock star. For those out there who love these drinks, you should give it a try, best tasting one yet. TL;DR Great tasting!"
"Coffee, lowfat soy milk and this you have a<br />costly cafe drink for a few cents. Now this<br />is common sense look at the price! TL;DR Great coffee sweetner"
"WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT FILL UP A ""SUPER BIG GULP"" CUP WITH 5 HOUR ENERGY AND CHUG THE WHOLE THING.

"There is this cafe down the road from where I live that serves the best cup of cocoa I have had in a long time.  I inquired as to how they make it and was told that it was ""Big Train Hot Chocolate.""<br /><br />I immediately came home and ordered the 3.5lb bag!  Its rich, creamy and satisfies that need for chocolate all the while warming your insides down to your toes!<br /><br />I now have my entire family stuck on this hot chocolate as well as friends who have personally ordered their own.  So if you are wanting that warm and cozy feeling you remember from being a kid with your cup of hot chocolate after a day playing in the snow.. purchase this, sit back and enjoy! TL;DR For that warm fuzzy feeling down to your toes!"
"This is the best tomatillo salsa I have found.  When I moved and it was no longer in the local grocery, I ordered it from Amazon because it is that good. TL;DR Great Salso Verde"
"This is the best true to taste mix for home made Shepherd's Pie. I've ordered this dish at many Irish Pub/Restaurants in NYC and find this mix comparable in taste. The Knorr ""Mealmaker"" seasoning packet, one pound of ground beef, 6-7 mashed potatoes and sauteed onions are all you need to create Shepherd's Pie that compares to restaurant fare. I add a small can of peas & carrots and an extra ""shot"" of ketchup to the mix from time to time; it works well for us! TL;DR Simple, fast and delicious one-dish casserole!"
I love this tea and the quality is great.  I will buy it again.  The plain flavor of the tea is rich and you can enjoy what roobios tastes like with out all the foo-foo flavor adding it receives with so many other Roobios tea packaging. TL;DR very very good
"Pill Pockets are the simplest means of administering pills to small animals, bar none.  The company is presumably in the process of adding new flavors (old ones are chicken and salmon), and we haven't tried any new ones yet.  But the ""old"" versions are highly recommended! TL;DR Administration of meds to small animals"
i love it. it was really small when i got it and now is getting big. and what good is that it doesnt need to be in the sun. i have it in my living room and i like it a lot. TL;DR nice plant
"This is a wonderful product that you can drink all day without any discomfort.  I grind the beans as I need them, thereby maintaining it's taste. TL;DR Delicious coffee"
I have very pleased with these lollipops.  My 3 year old son loves them.  The only thing I wish was that it didn't have any artificial flavors in it. I wish they were flavored with fruit flavors instead. TL;DR Pleased with product
"It's actually a very nice basic tea, I would have given it 4 stars, had it not been sold as Passion Fruit Tea.  The flavor is hardly detectable in traces, I'd call it a good, basic, unflavored tea. TL;DR Nice tea, but where is the passion fruit flavor?"
"I am a ""chocoholic"" and need something chocolate after dinner each night. This is one of my favorite dark chocolate candies. It has a delicious chocolate and coconut taste, and is nice and chewy.<br /><br />The snack size is just right, and a great way to practice portion control.<br /><br />Shop for price. We buy these on sale at our local supermarket or chain drugstore for less than the price on Amazon. TL;DR Great tasting chocolate"
"After Costco stopped carrying it & I couldnt find it in any stores nearby, I started looking online to order it. I found it on Amazon & ordered the 6-pack as part of the subscription deal. Delivery was prompt and the cereal tastes awesome as expected. However, it looks to me that Amazon's inventory is quite old. The expiration of the 6 boxes was only 3 months away. And, I cant return this to Amazon either. Only option is to try to finish this in 3 months - have it for breakfast,lunch & dinner I guess.<br /><br />Thats why I'm giving this 4 stars as opposed to the 5 stars the product deserves. TL;DR Cereal's awesome but Amazon's stock is old"
"this product was recommended by a friends vet.  My dog likes it and hopefully she is healthier because of it.  Sent on time, packed well, will reorder from this supplier. TL;DR healthy"
"These no pudge, fat free brownies are incredible.  Very easy to make and absolutely delicious. I baked them in a muffin pan. Highly recommend even if you aren't on a diet! TL;DR Best Brownies Ever."
I have bought this rice several times at our local grocery store and LOVE it.  We cook it in chicken broth and the taste is sooo good.  No seasoning required! TL;DR Yum Yum!
"I'm a big fan of the wholesome goodness of Honey Maid graham crackers.  We use them for peanut butter sandwiches and smores, and sometimes just for a nice snack with apples.  The kids love them, and so do I.<br />When I ordered the subscribe and save option was available.  I see that sometimes this disappears, I imagine due to stocking.  It was a great deal when I ordered, at least a dollar a box less expensive than my local store. I thought I was getting a fantastic deal, until the boxes arrived.  Instead of long sheets of grahams, what I got was more of a powder - the crackers had been completely obliterated in shipping.  Not just a cracker or two, but well more than half of each box. Bummer.<br />I might try this again, but unless you're looking to make a lot of pie crust, you might consider spending the extra dollar and getting an intact box. TL;DR Great item, not so great packaging"
Have been purchasing this tuna for some time now. Price varies so try to find it when the price is low. Delicious quality tuna.  This brand is not available where I live. Just another reason I love Amazon.  Thank you Amazon! TL;DR Great price for an excellent product
The Illy Issimo Cappuccino drink is smooth and refreshing. A wonderful cold 8.45 oz cappuccino that is made with lowfat milk and cocoa and is only 100 calories.  The drink is made from All natural with 100% percent Arabica coffee and sweetened with beet sugar. I truly enjoyed this and can't wait to try the other flavors from Illy Issimo. TL;DR If you love Cappuccion's or Latte's this is for you!
"I eat a lot of granola cereal. This is one of the better ones. i like having it delivered, but I'm not sure that I'm saving any money. Now with having to pay sales tax in Texas, it will not be worth it.  But, it is very tasty.  4 stars because of cost, not quality TL;DR Tasty, but a little pricey"
"I use this all the time for my morning smoothie. The protein stops the hunger pangs.  A couple of ice cubes, a little water, a small banana....blend a little...add a tablespoon of egg white and blend some more.  your protein and a carb in a delicious format.  I like to add a small handful of frozen blueberries or a little high quality vanilla for variety.  The egg white will foam up the smoothie a little. I have been using the deb-el egg white for a while now and I am pleased with the product.  The product will settle in the container so it seems half empty when you get it but it is all there.  Use a measure spoon.  My husband must have put the equivalent of 8 eggs in the first smoothie he made by just dumping it in straight out of the container. TL;DR Eggcellant Product"
"I grew up with this kind of relish in Massachusetts. We called it Piccalilli.<br />The brand we used was Cain's.<br />Howard's is good but it would be much better if they didn't use high fructose corn syrup which is an additive widely used that is destroying the health of many people (obesity, diabetes, high blood sugar). Also Xanthan gum gives it an unctuous almost greasy texture. Cain's never used these additives back then and I hope doesn't use them today. That brand is not available here in Florida unfortunately, otherwise I would but that in preference to Howard's. TL;DR Good but could be much better"
"We are scheduled to receive a bag of Raspberry gummis once a month.  Today we received the candy for the second time with the bag slit and the candy throughout the box.  The box contained other items.  It was evident that whoever packed the box knew the bag was slit and tried to conceal it by putting it upside down and thus guaranteeing that all the candy was contaminated. TL;DR Candy great, packaging and Amazon's handling abysmal"
"My husband and I love these.  This is so much easier and nicer than cereal from a big box...  we find that we eat these often; and hardly ever ate cereal otherwise.  These are great to take to work.  The individual portion size helps us, and we love having the freshness these provide.  The cost is excellent as well.  And the container recyclable. TL;DR Love the individual servings of Special K"
"I purchased this tea because I was searching for a replacement to the Pompadour Rosehip and Hibiscus tea which is becoming increasingly hard to find, not to mention far more expensive.  I found this tea to be a little milder, but overall an acceptable replacement.  If you like stronger tea, I would suggest using two bags per cup since there is not as much tea per bag as other brands.  I still gave the product five stars because the taste is wonderful and tea strength is really a personal preference. TL;DR Great Tea!"
"Kaia kale chips are not for everyone. Raw food tastes different from processed food so many people who are used to processed food will not find raw chips tasty.<br />In addition, kale in general has a very specific taste that some may find unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable (bitter).<br /><br />But if you appreciate raw food and like kale these chips are for you. They taste great and they are crisp.<br />The only downside is the price but it must be fairly expensive to prepare raw and organic food. TL;DR Best raw chips"
"Love this gel. I have tried all others, and I do like this the best. It gives me the energy output needed to keep going. The extra caffeine gives me a mental edge. The expresso flavor is great tasting even though I don't like expresso drinks.<br /><br />I tried it for the first time during the 2004 Columbus Marathon when they were handing it out. It helped me finish my first marathon.<br /><br />-unluckyrunner TL;DR Best gel, Best flavor"
Me and my wife liked this drink pretty good...It tasted very similar to the sparkling drinks you can buy that are non-alcoholic in Apple flavor...can't figure why it has a apple taste since it's not in the ingredients but it does.<br /><br />I would say this would be great as a special drink to have once every few days or so..but so far as drinking it every day all day....I wouldn't like it that much. TL;DR Pretty good tasting....not your everyday drink
"I wanted to let my chickens roam freely in my back yard but they kept digging up my flower garden I installed this fence in  30 minutes. One chicken  wandered into it on day 2, she let out a loud squawk and strutted away. The rest of the chickens must have learned their lesson because its been over 2weeks and nobody has gotten near the flower garden. I don't even turn it on any more. TL;DR very easy set up"
"This is Justin on Milinda's account.  First of all, apple cider vinegar is practically magic.  It is amazing and can help with so many ailments, aches, and pains that it's not even funny.  But it is by no means delicious!  It tastes like Hell has puked in your mouth!  I have to take it by the shot, and then I wash away what taste I did get with a glass of water.  It's worth the taste, though, for all it can do for you! TL;DR Not quite what it says..."
mitigates the jitters from caffeine. its an antidote for caffeine. i get all the alertness without some of the side effects. TL;DR good stuff
my dogs are doxies they love them the larger sizes the seem to be good for them and they love them TL;DR quality
"Just the right amount of spice and tangy bleu cheese flavor, plus a lovely crinkle-cut crunch.  I'm just grateful that the bags aren't any larger, since I find it impossible to stop eating these until I've finished the entire 2-oz. bag.<br /><br />So far, I've bought both these Buffalo Bleu and the Salt and Vinegar flavors, and they're both excellent quality chips. TL;DR delicious -- good thing the bags aren't any bigger"
I first bought these biscuits in a specialty store in another town.  My dog loves them!  I could not find them where I live.  I found them here and get them on line now for a better price.  I highly recommend them.  My dog cannot have any sweet because of her tendency toward diabetic like symptoms.  These are healthy and tasty and have NO molasses in them.  Every biscuit now a days has molasses.  WHY?  These biscuits make us BOTH happy! TL;DR Yummy dog biscuits!
"The Oyster Stew could of been better if it would of had whole oryster's in it. All there is, is pieces of the oryster. You have to add a complete can of milk of equal size to make this soup good. Not the best but it's still pretty good. Will not buy 12 more. TL;DR Could of been better"
"My wife decided at that last moment that she was going to put a dish together for our guest the very next day. The product was not available locally, so I went to Amazon and found every item that was needed to prepare the dish. Again, because of Amazon's shipping options I was able to receive the ingredients on time for the evening of the meal. Did I pay more, yes. Did I need as much as it came packaged, no. But it worked out because, I expected to pay more for our mistake of not having on hand the proper ingredients, plus our guess liked the meal and we were able to share the extra quantity with them, along with the receipt, so it all worked out. TL;DR Sriracha"
"Love it!  This product really works, but you have to stick to it. I stopped it for few days just to test it and my supply really duplicated after going back to it.<br />I make the tea and don't put sugar on it, I let it sit until is room temperature. I make it 2ce a day and sometimes I take a 3rd cup before bed!<br />Definitely recommend !!! TL;DR It really works!!!"
"I've always enjoyed Fig Newtons, but for completely different reasons than these cookies. When it comes to these cookies, I really like the crunch. They are nice and crunchy, and the thin design is good, too. I appreciate the fact that there are natural ingredients here like rolled oats and dried blueberries. The blueberry taste comes through well. Great as morning munchies as I'm getting ready for work, actually! TL;DR The crunch is the key"
"Just checked the local grocery store and find the exactly same product at $12, compared to $40 here. This is ridiculous! TL;DR Outrageous price"
"this is the best tea ever.  even being decaf does not take away from the strong ""tea"" flavor.  most people don't know what real tea tastes like. but this is a wonderful tea in the english tradition.  this seller sent this product in good condition and in a timely manner. TL;DR best tea ever and it is even decaf"
"You only get 6 treats in this bag, all different sizes. If they were all uniform in length it would get another star. Some of the pieces were only 2 inches long, others being over 4"". Very easy for my lab pup to get the whole thing out in seconds. Stick to dry food and cap it with peanut butter, it lasts longer and is cheaper. TL;DR Not worth the price"
"Purchased this item because the product description and the image both showed the product as a 6.6 pound bag, not a 3.3 pound bag. $18 is pretty ridiculous for just 3.3 pounds of this specific cat food. Will buy larger, cheaper back from local distributor next time. TL;DR Don't be fooled by product image and description"
"Newman's own does it again!<br /><br />These Licorice Twists are the best, most flavorful (Pomegranate, no less!) that I've had in recent memory.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they are...small (but, that in itself, will not detract anything from the score)!<br /><br />I invite everyone who reads this to try them...delicious!<br /><br />I rate ""Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists, 5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 15)""...Five stars! TL;DR Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists, 5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 15)..."
"This product, as well as the beef broth, tastes so much fresher than canned broths and smells better too.  Another great advantage is that it takes up so much less room in the pantry. TL;DR Much better than canned broth"
"I love this gum. It's delicious and really helps me to overcome cravings.<br /><br />Amazon Prime is timely and professional, as always. TL;DR Delicious Gum, Great Service"
"Sorry, but it does not pass my taste test. I've always liked the Haribo brand gummies, but the Albanese brand just does not cut it. The peach flavor of these gummies is the wrong type, in addition it is not sour enough (not sour at all for my taste). I wish the company can send me some citric acid to add to these gummies. TL;DR Nowhere near Haribo"
"I love Hormel Compleats. They're all very convenient, since I can stash them in a cabinet in my office and not worry about remembering to bring something from home, or about it getting stolen from the communal refrigerator.<br /><br />I didn't care much for this... the dressing is pasty, gluey and has way too much celery for my taste. The gravy is too salty. The chicken breast is dry, stringy, and difficult to cut unless you remove it to a plate, which defeats the purpose of such a quick microwave meal. TL;DR Salty, and too much celery"
"My nine year-old labracollie has a very sensitive tummy and is allergic to a lot of foods.  I started my labracollie on Instinct Grain-Free Duck/Turkey about two months ago, when I ran out of her usual dog food (which was working out ""okay"") and had to give her our wiener dog's food.  I immediately noticed how pungent this dog food was.  It smelled very concentrated but I ensured myself it was not bad by checking the kibble and expiration date.  The smell may shock some people, but after that initial surprise, I noticed how eager my dog looked when she got a whiff of this food.  I think some dogs like stinky-smelling food.  She started eating it right away, and the very next day I was happy to see that she passed a normal stool!  It was even great that she was not scratching like she a maddog.<br /><br />After she did well on the Duck/Turkey, I bought the Beef/Lamb.  She was fine on this one too.  I try to give her a variety of options to keep her interested in her meals so I was glad that I found at least two choices<br /><br />It's only been two months so I can't comment on how she does long-term.  I will probably update this review if I find notice anything that I feel could be shared.  My dog is about 52 pounds and I go through the 13-pound bag in about two weeks.  The results, so far, definitely validate the additional cost; and I feel this brand is decently priced compared to other grain-free dog foods out there.  So far she has tried the Turkey/Duck and Beef/Lamb and she liked both of them, and is still passing normal stool.  Unfortunately she's allergic to chicken so I can't give her the Chicken mix and she has never particularly cared for fish so I am debating if I should bother with the Salmon Meal.  My next bag will probably be the Instinct Grain-Free Limited Ingredients, just to give it a try.<br /><br />So to recap...<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good for dogs with sensitive tummies and food allergies<br />2. Kibbles are small.<br />3. Reasonable price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Smells strong. TL;DR Happy dog, happy tummy, happy human."
"I've been sick for two weeks, and this stuff is the only thing keeping me going. The ginger had a good burn to it, which helps soothe thorats and calm down coughs, but the lemon mellows it out a bit. TL;DR Great for coughs"
"This is a tasty product, but not quite sweet enough for me as it comes. A spoonful of sugar makes it right, but the prices for this stuff are ridiculous.<br />The tea supply was not (to my knowledge) affected by the recent coffee shortage which raised prices across the board. This price comes out to almost 60 cents a cup and I pay less than that for Kona blend k-cups, even with the shortage. I will not be buying this product just because of that. Profit is ok, obscene profit is not. Shame on you Green Mountain! TL;DR Delicious, but prices are way off."
"My kids absolutely love this waffle mix, we've tried a lot and these is the best we've had - not to mention it's organic (truly organic, not like a lot of products that make the claim) so I don't worry about what they are putting in their bodies.  Order some  you won't be disappointed! TL;DR Excellent Waffle Mix"
"These are a hard candy--hard like a Lifesaver, not like a hard toffee such as the Rio coffee candy, which will soften somewhat in your mouth. The flavor is about as strong as the Rio but noticeably more piquant and a bit richer and more complex than the Kopiko brand but as sweet. The flavor is also more consistent from lot to lot than Rio (Rio can be great and it can be awful). The pieces about the size of a lifesaver so I doubt anyone would find them uncomfortable.<br /><br />They not twist wrapped but in sealed bags and are more difficult to unwrap than the Rios but not as difficult as the Kopikos. TL;DR One of the two or three best-in-flavor coffee candies"
"The single cup coffee maker works well as advertized and makes great coffee. One of the two was damaged in shipment (box was squashed in the corner) but at this price it was not worth sending back.<br />Two slight quibbles:<br />1. The top piece was designed more for a 'sweeping' look than snugly fitting a #2 cone filter<br />2. It would be great if someone could design one of these single coffee makers where one could pour in the full 6 / 8 ounces of hot water at one time and not have to hover over it to keep topping it off, at the same time worrying about over filling it.<br />Note: the thermal carafe is the best portable hot travel mug I have used. It's deep lip keeps the hot liquid from spilling in the car. TL;DR A Keeper"
"My boyfriend has celiac disease and it's been hard finding things he will eat.  All the other pancake mixes we tried were just nasty until we ran across Bob's Red Mill Pancake Mix.  This has got to be the best stuff we have eaten.  We won't eat anything else.  If we don't have Bob's Red Mill, we won't eat a waffle/pancake.  You have to try this stuff. TL;DR These are amazing pancakes."
"Kind bars are not only all natural but gluten free as well! They are a great tasting snack (can be a meal replacement), that are filling and available in a variety of flavors. And yes - these are made in the US of A. So, you don't have to worry about contamination.<br /><br />I have a personal preference against peanuts and unfortunately that limits your selection but there are still quite a few options. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is my favorite since it not only is all healthy nuts (no peanuts!) but also includes a vegetarian source of Omega 3 - flax seeds.<br /><br />Our four year old loves these bars as well and that makes these truly special (as part of what I can assure you is a very small list of healthy foods!) Amazon's price on these is the best! TL;DR All natural and all fun!"
"I ordered this hazelnut chocolate mix for my wife, and the double chocolate mix for myself.  I prefer the hazelnut to the regular chocolate. It has a really delicious flavor nothing like any other mix I have tried before. TL;DR Best mix ever!"
"This food is GREAT! I adopted my two Pomeranians and they'd been on IAMS - pretty crummy stuff. I switched them over to this and not only do they eat less of it, but their poop is much healthier looking (firmer, not runny anymore.) Their coats are fuller and the eye gook they used to get seems to have really gone away. A friend of mine told me he feeds his dog blueberries to get rid of eye slime, so I'm wondering if this food has a similar nutrient. Really great stuff! The only thing that would be better is if you actually cooked for your dog! TL;DR Great Food, Better Poop!"
Update August 2012:  I changed my mind about never ordering again and signed up for regular auto shipments.  They must have paid attention to the post because the boxes are now sealed much better.<br /><br />*******************<br /><br />Original review:  I love this product in the large bags so I ordered the small bags for portion control.  Product is great but was shipped by the manufacturer whose shipping department wasn't careful enough with the sealing tape.  The box arrived totally open with the bags showing.  None were missing; the chips in the one bag that I've eaten weren't even crushed.  But I'm not taking a chance again on such poor shipping practices. TL;DR Update
"My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time, but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain, but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line. TL;DR My son loves this food!"
"If you like curry - this is the product for you.  Easy to use and tastes great - recommend for anyone. TL;DR S&B Golden Curry Sauce Mix, Extra Hot, 8.4-Ounce"
"I'm about to place a second order for this chocolate -- I love it!  The chocolate is high quality and very smooth.  I noticed only a very slight aftertaste when I first tried it, but that quickly disappeared.  For me, this is the best sugar-free option out there, and it fits in perfectly with my eating plan.  You have to be a dark chocolate fan to enjoy this, but I've always preferred dark chocolate, and I seek out those chocolates with the highest concentration of cocoa (at least 87%).  If you love dark chocolate but want to avoid added sugars and sugar alcohols, this is the ticket. The company shipped the product very quickly, and it was well packed for the journey.  With expedited shipping, they include ice packs and insulated wrapping. TL;DR Healthy and Delicious"
"This tea is unbelievable.  I have been using it for some time now.  Just started buying online.  As long as a drink some each day I do not have sinus problems, not even nasal drip.  I shared some with my sister-in-law, she said it was better than anything the doctors gave her.  It works!!!!!!!!  It is the best.  No side effects.  It just works!!!!!<br />Ok hot or cold with or without sweetner.  Enjoy with lemon and ice for summer. TL;DR Best"
"I love all the Bakery on Main products I have tried, but this is my favorite. I love the flavor combination of the orange and cranberry and it's such a treat to be able to enjoy a great granola on my gluten-free diet.  I use a little bit of this with other cereals to make it last longer, and it is super crunchy and flavorful. TL;DR Great flavor combination"
"Great spice.  I use it all the time, especially with my fresh fish. Try soaking fresh fish in saltwater with 1-2 Tblsp. jerk seasoning added for 10-15 min.  Then prepare as desired.  Works great, taste fabulous. TL;DR Great Seasoning"
"I bought this one a little while ago and it is great. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I have more space now since I no longer need one of the Keurig cup trees sitting next to my machine, all I need is to slide the draw out from underneath my machine and I have a ton of choices. Thank you. My only regret is that I bought the plastic one and it doesn't look nearly as nice as the glass one does, but maybe that will be my christmas present to myself. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. This is great! TL;DR Perfect for what it is"
"We received the starter within a couple of days and after following the directions, the starter was active and ready to go.  It is very active starter, and have made sourdough bread, hamburger buns and wheat bread with much success.  It does not have as sour a taste as what we are use to.  I think that we may be able to regulate this.  Would certainly recommend this product. TL;DR Great Starter"
"These crackers are so great!  And gluten free too.  Once you eat one, you'll want more.  We have difficulty finding them around our town, and when they're packed in these plastic trays, they don't break up as bad as they do when they're packaged in the bags.  We bought a case @ Halloween, and now I've ordered another one for Xmas! TL;DR These are delicious!"
My whole family (including two kids ages 7 and 5) love these bars. They are not too sweet (which is nice for a change) yet very tasty. TL;DR We All Love These
"I've tried other nut butters in the past, but couldn't get past the grainy texture and the ho-hum taste. This one changed all that! I LOVE crunchy peanut butter, and this crunchy almond butter did not let me down. Very creamy texture (no graininess AT ALL)with a robust nutty flavor, with nice substantial almond pieces throughout. It works well in a dip I make, and is wonderful in sandwiches. It spreads easily and thankfully isn't separated with a layer of oil on top like other nut butters I've tried. This product will replace peanut better in my house! My favorite lunch is an almond butter and blackberry jam sandwich on pumpernickel bread...drool.... TL;DR Fantastic!"
"It's winter here, so in a couple weeks I had a good batch of KOMBUCHA tea. It was probably one of the best tastes I've ever had. This is the second time I've made it, the first time I've ordered a mother. The first time I used two bottles of GT kombucha.<br /><br />This seems to be a great deal. The tea tastes great and gives the body buzz. TL;DR Excellent Tasting"
"Awesome product...It is hard to find things with low sugar, low salt, and low fat with a great taste. This product definately fits the bill! TL;DR Yummmm"
"Yummy with iced tea! I keep Zsweet in my car, purse, at my sisters house, at work. I won't drink iced tea without it. I ALWAYS used Equal in my iced tea until my friend told me to try Zsweet. Once I did. I was addicted. Trust me! You won't go back to Equal/Splenda/Sweet N Low. TL;DR Iced tea lover"
"Nice little black olive bonsai with developing nebari  It came wired into its glazed pot in fast-draining soil mix.  Since was early southwest US summer when it arrived, the tree went outside immediately, in a shady spot.  Later on it went into the sun, where is is producing flowers now.  So long as it is watered daily, it's a healthy, slow growing little tree.  Come fall, it will be brought inside with another black olive as these don't like temperatures below 50 degrees.  These trees are so easy to care for and do so well in this climate that I highly recommend them for anybody in the southern part of the USA.  Black olives, black pines and a couple of Chinese elms are the only bonsai I have that thrive in the full blast of mid-New Mexico sun. TL;DR Black Olive Bonsai Tree"
"This is my third order of Silver Palette from them. We go through boxes of their oatmleal every winter. If you are a Prime member you pay no shipping and no tax so comparing the price to our grocery stores it's a nice savings on the bet oatmeal. I only wish I could use the coupons they occassionally come with, but that's a minor savings of .25 . I'll be ordering again next month as we eat it almost every morning. Oatmeal is one of the best ways to lower your cholesterol too. TL;DR Greatest Oatmeal"
"This Premier toy can be loaded with the Gnawhide treats (see my Gnawhide Treat review). We don't really play bounce with it; we just sit quitely and enjoy the ""pepperoni"" treat before bedtime. Very worth the price for a chewing, active puppy. TL;DR Bouncy Bone a Big Hit"
"Good cereal and at the price Amazon had it for with their 50% off special, it's good stuff. My kids like it too.  It's not too sweet either, it's sweet but not sickeningly so like some of the kids cereals. TL;DR Good for the money"
"These are wonderful!  They're definitely chocolate, but not overpowering.  The sea salt provides a nice foil, so you can eat a whole bag by yourself without going into a chocolate coma (maybe that's bad).  They're just sweet enough to make the chocolate happen.  They're like ""hint of oreo"" without all the garbage and without all the guilt (unless you eat a whole bag in one sitting).<br />I've had them with a peach salsa, which was nice.  I think they'd go really well with a fresh fruit salad.  They'd go well with ice cream, and they're perfect with a tart, plain yogurt.  I dipped them in hummus too, and while it doesn't not work...I'm not sure it's great.  Still, basically they're versatile and not too bad for you.  When you find yourself at the bottom of the bag you can always say, ""well, at least it wasn't a bag of oreos."" TL;DR snack food heaven"
"Label clearly says ""Cranberry, JUICE COCTAIL FROM CONCENTRATE with other natual flavors"",verbatum incl. caps on, except the word Cranberry is 4 x as larger than the other wording below it.  How the heck can they claim it's not from concentrate when it's clearly worded otherwise on the front of the label!<br />I was expecting to actually get to taste natural juice for a change...boy was I wrong.  How do they get off writing their story when the label clearly states otherwise?  It's ridiculous.<br />It has a slight cran tang to it, but a far cry from tasting fresh!  In fact it tastes like it's ingredients...THE MAIN INGREDIENT IS WATER and the second is HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP...the worst ingredient ever!<br />I AM APAULED AT THE FALSE ADVERTISEMENT GOING ON HERE, SOMEONE SHOULD SUE THEM...they advertise natural juice not from concentrate while trying to sell their product, then you get water, high fructose corn syrup and a little natural juice that is from concentrate!<br />SHOOT THIS COMPANY'S ADVERTISING EXEC IN THE HEAD, he's trying to kill us with the ingredients and I am actually drinking the crud because I paid so much for it, so he's probably adding to my death.<br />I can throw it out because Amazon said they will make good and are investigating the product's advertisement...Amazon has great morals, thanks Amazon...hope you like the pics that prove I am not a crazy, irate customer.<br />27% juice, the rest water and high fructose corn syrup (worse for you than sugar)...I posted pictures. TL;DR ""JUICE COCTAIL ""FROM CONCENTRATE"""", False advertisement!!!"
"Let's face it: the gold standard in root beer is A&W on tap, end of discussion. However, we were not all born blond and blue-eyed. Case in point: Sioux City Root Beer. It tastes as close as you can get to the real thing and sports a good head on its shoulders. What more could a body ask? That's why it earns 5 stars from yours truly. TL;DR Tastes as root beer shouid"
"I was surprised at how plump and sweet they are. These are much better than the drier non-organic red box version. Certainly it is more cost effective to buy them in larger containers such as Newman's organic raisins which are also very good, but this product meets my needs for individual packs, plus they'd be great to give out at Halloween. TL;DR plump and sweet"
This tea has just the slightest hints of orange zest and a little spice. It reminds me of when I used to go to Seattle to my grandmother's house and we would have tea and her famous apple pie. A relaxing tea you can drink with honey or with milk and sugar. Orange Blossom honey is recommended with this refreshing tea.<br /><br />~TheRebeccaReview.com TL;DR Worth buying for the office...
"Pros: Low Cal. Cons: Hardly any flavor. Seriously, I taste nothing but ""puff"". They get stale fast, and the bag always tears when opening. Always! Very annoying. Sorry, if you want cheddar flavor, look elsewhere. These remind me of rice crackers. TL;DR No good."
"Kids love these and it's a nice alternative to fried chips.  I Know they're still junk food, but they're certainly better for you then many treats on the market.  They also happen to taste great too. TL;DR Delicious"
My favorite canned chili.<br />Best canned chili taste. A brown chili without too much tomato in it. Mild spice my friends and family love it We used to only find it in NYC TL;DR Great Brown Chili
"This product provides a smooth cup of coffee with a slightly nutty taste. I drink about 3 cups a day with long intervals in between, so I love the pod system.  It's quick and easy, and allows me to have a fresh, hot brewed cup every time. TL;DR Tasty...and easy!"
"This tea is excellent, but make sure to brew it for no longer than a minute or two, and use cooler water than you would normally use for tea. TL;DR Good tea, but don't brew too long"
"Usually, I consume protein bars during my work day, but I had to search for something to replace those bars during the hotter months in my part of California because protein bars melt quite quickly if not stored in a cooler with ice packs. I was on the search for something that would not weigh me down during the work day, taste good, and portable. I tried several other flavors before I found two that agreed with my taste buds - almond & coconut and nut delight. TL;DR Stays better intact than protein bars in the heat"
"These have a nice pea flavor and are tasty.  However, I can't see how these are much better for you than potato chips (the only difference is really a pea vs. a potato, as they have about the same amount of fat.)  They claim they are baked but they are very oily.  Eating a serving or two of steamed peas would be a much healthier, and perhaps tastier, way of snacking. TL;DR Tasty, but not really a healthy snack"
These are by far the most flavorful butter toffee nuts I have ever purchased.  They are hard to find in my area so I was doubly pleased to find them at a good price but also at a great quality. TL;DR oh so good!
"Well, I fell for it too! This is the biggest scam I have ever seen. Are people aware that Penn State couldn't find anything special about Mr. Trivedi? Are people also aware that several of the endorsements that he claims are not true and he has been contacted to remove those endorsements. It's good tasting water, but not at $39.00 for 24 which works out to $1.63 per bottle. I am going back to my Crystal Geyser water that costs me 11 CENTS PER BOTTLE. TL;DR Scam"
"Wow - I thought I was eating a good old fashioned italian biscuit - packed with Almonds, sweet - DELISCIOUS! Then I realized - I was also getting all that extra protein and nowhere near as many calories or carbs! What a find! The holidays weren't that bad for my diet after all! Great job! TL;DR Biscotti - who would have ever thought they could be HEALTHY!"
"While German chocolate tastes very good, I grew up with it, charging $4.99 for this is pretty lame, yes I did read the description and bought it, however this store or seller is taking it from the living, in other words, I don't think I come back to buy, to expensive! TL;DR Price Gauging on small piece of German chocolate"
I am training for a marathon and was having trouble with cramping. In the past i had only used gatoraid and that was not stopping the cramps.I had tried Zico in other flavors but chocolate is the only one I can tolerate. I actually love the chocolate. Since using it after runs over 90mins. I no longer get cramps. It is best cold. I also mix it into my smoothie as a recovery drink. I order it by the case now since my grocery store does not always have it and I don't want to run out. TL;DR Zico
"Smelled wonderful as I was brewing it. Sadly, it smells more blueberry than it really tastes-however! I do have a bit of a cold, so I may not be tasting in it fully. I just added creamer and it was splendid. Would totally order again. Really awesome with fresh scones. TL;DR Tasty!"
This product is cheaper than in stores or other brands.  The flavor is tangy.  I use it in all of my cheese replacements and soups for nutrition and a tangy chicken flavor replacement. TL;DR Vegan Chicken or Cheese flavor
"i love the flavor and taste of these bars.  the multigrain is made up of oats and barley, giving the crust a fresh taste and not crumbly.  the triple berries is a nice blend and there is not one overwhelming flavor between the crust and berries.  150 calories, 29g of carbs.  it is a tasty and filling bar.  highly recommended for a breakfast treat along with a good cup of coffee! TL;DR very tasty"
Best Toscano salami available.  wish it would be carried by the major food chains.  Thank you for a great tasting salami! TL;DR Toscano salami
"I ordered a couple boxes of this Kataifi Dough from Parthenon Foods. I don't think they were shipped in dry ice, as they were thawed by the time they arrived at our doorstep. Nevertheless, they were well packed and the delivery was very quick, so they were still in good condition. We put them in the freezer and used the first pack about ten days later. My dad says the quality of the dough was impressive compared to the fresh ones he could get at the local stores and the dessert came out very nicely. Still, I don't think I would order them during summer, especially if there is a chance for the delivered boxes to wait for hours under the sun. Order a few boxes during winter and enjoy them throughout the year. :) TL;DR Good quality, wish they were kept frozen during shipping"
at it's best.  I have been drinking this tea since high school and the flavor has not wavered.  I've tried plain chamomile and it didn't make the cut. Nothing beats a cup or two of Sleepy Time before bed as it calms the nerves and settles the tummy.  What a perfect way to drift off into slumber ! TL;DR Tradition
"Product arrived super fast and was packed with 2 koolit packs to keep the chocolate from melting.  Even though it was hot out, the product was perfect.  This has been one of my favorite childhood treats, and this was the first time I have ordered from this source.  While it was not quite the same as others I have had, the candy was still delicious and I have totally enjoyed them.  I will definitely be ordering again. TL;DR Delicious Treat"
"Very nice corn, lovely texture. needs a little more oil than usual to get it popping. TL;DR Very Nice"
Used this product as a bean alternative in my spicy chicken chili recipe.  A home run with the sports fans in my family.  Chips or cornbread finish this off great.  Save the spices with all Glory products...they're full of flavor already. TL;DR Chili with a twist
I got this pack of cookies for my mom she cant have gluten she loves them so much she will buy more and she says she can tell they honestly are gluten free. It can be hard for people want to eat well or have special diet needs to have treats so I am happy I found these. TL;DR YUMMY : )
"These wintergreen mints are my family's all time favorite, and they don't contain the additives we're trying to avoid. My friends and family have had the hardest time finding these at our local health stores, so subscribing to them is sooooo convenient. Organic & Tasty, THANK YOU Amazon & Newman's Own! TL;DR LOVE LOVE LOVE EM!"
"I got this pasta for my 14 month old and she loves it. I hated giving her the Kraft with all the extra stuff we don't need in it. I don't follow the directions very well though, i just put the milk and cheese in the pan with the drained pasta and so far no lump problems i just add a little extra splash of milk. Some times I put in a bit of plain yogurt instead of all the milk, it makes it nice a thick. I love the flavor because it compliments all the mix in's veggies, tuna, you name it. Plus the little peace shapes are toddler finger friendly. And my daughter finds the tie dye on the box pretty cool, it's hard to keep the boxes in my cupboards, they usually end up in a toy box. Overall we love the peace pasta, so yummy!!! TL;DR We love Annie's Pasta"
"The coffee bean direct coffee is good coffee, and a great value. It also makes good expresso. It did take a while to arrive, but was worth the wait. I fell in love with Costa Rican coffee while visiting on vacation and this is almost as good as being there TL;DR Good coffee, good value"
I needed a protector under my keurig machine for the new quartz counters-and here it is! great product arrived fast and new! thanks! TL;DR love this pod storage unit!
"I've had a lot of sweetened condensed milk over the years, predominantly in Vietnamese style iced coffees.  It's the kind of product that I never gave any thought to - I figured they all tasted about the same, blaa blaa blaa.<br /><br />I ordered this particular one because I'd never seen sweetened condensed milk offered in the organic format, because organic milk tends to taste better.<br /><br />I couldn't believe it when I first used this.  It is way, WAY better than any other sweetened condensed milk I've ever tried.  It is thick and rich, but not gloopy or glue-like.  It has more of a syrupy or honey-like flow, and even the color is more appealing - sort of a golden cream tone.  There is no hint of can/tinny flavor, and the milk tastes very fresh and natural, even with the sweetness.  To me, it seems that this is a little less sweet than some others I've tried; but I'm sure it's still certainly sweet enough for whatever baking etc. you'd want to do with it.  It makes awesome iced coffees, I would never use anything else now. TL;DR Oh By Far The Best - Really Astonishing Difference"
These are very good dates - quite moist and meaty.  We like the packaging which helps keep them fresh.  We have to limit ourselves to 2 or 3 a day otherwise we could sit and eat the whole container at once! Yum! Yum! Yum! TL;DR Excellent Product
"I feel like I have a pretty good palette for Indian food, especially curry. While I'm no means an expert, I lived in London for awhile and sampled some of the best curry while also knowing you can find great flavors in local spots in metropolitan cities.<br /><br />As such and now that I'm back in a suburb, I really just wanted something that would satisfy my craving for a Tikka Masala-type curry that I can throw veggies and chicken into.<br /><br />This isn't it. While it's not horrible, there just isn't much flavor. There seems to be a lack of cocunut milk to give it a hint of sweetness and the cloves that are usually added to balance out the colors seems watered down. I say skip. TL;DR Just O.K."
"Bubblegum lovers listen up!<br />Better than Bazooka. Flavor lasts longer,texture for bubbles has more elasticity and snaps better too!<br />Worth the sugar. TL;DR Dubble Bubble Still The Best"
"My aunt gave me a jar of this the other day and told me to try it, it is the best spice ever. So I did. And all I can say is....yum!! It IS the best spice ever. I have used it on everything since getting it. I had to look online to see where I could get it when I ran out. It is sooo good. You will not regret this purchase! TL;DR LOVE IT!!!!!!"
"It's a good product and my dog likes them, but didn't last as long as I had expected.  She's a Cocker Spaniel and made quick work of it.  I like the combination of ingredients.  Seems to be a healthy snack.<br />They are nicely packaged and arrived on time.  I will order again. TL;DR dog chews"
"My little one likes to eat another brand of ""organic fruit chews"". I think they're just ok. I got these on a whim, they are sooo good. I like eating them too. the name says it all...""Tasty"". My little one liked them so much, when he finished the pack he began holding them up to the car window and told me he wantd everyone to try the super good new fruit chews. I highly recommend them! they even have 100% of your vit C for the day ;-) TL;DR oh yummmm"
"These bars are very good, they do seem to have quite a bit of ""fillers"" in comparison to actual nuts as opposed to the peanut version, but still very good.  My son ate all six boxes in 10 days. ugh. TL;DR very good!"
"This is nothing like your yellow mustard. Nice midium-hot,smooth consitency,easy to spread on bread or precels. Very good Europien quality mustard. TL;DR Best mustard."
"Leibniz cookies are truly my favorite, beyond what I make, I am a passionate cook. The whole wheat version of these are particularly superb with a subtly greater flavor than the original and a lovely, slightly more crumbly and grainy texture. It has been a wonderful discovery. Bon appetit. TL;DR De-Licious with perfect packaging"
"I use this to wake up in the morning because I have delayed sleep phase syndrome. It is very convenient to sip in bed, compared to a soda or a pill. I like the extreme version because I only sip it and the extreme lasts longer. I'm somewhat sensitive to caffeine so I never drink a whole bottle. I use the 5-Hour brand instead of the cheaper alternatives because it does have a bunch of chemicals, and I assume they have a lot to lose if something goes wrong, so they probably spend more on quality control.<br /><br />If all you want is energy, caffeine pills are way cheaper. You can get 60-100 for a few bucks. They only give you mental energy though, but 5-Hour gives you physical energy.<br /><br />Someone mentioned green tea. I also recommend matcha green tea. It is a very good low level, long duration energy, but it's also expensive. I won't even mention cocaine - oops just did. TL;DR Use it to wake up, cheaper options"
Love pork ramen...so much better than other flavor. Glad I found it on Amazon! This is my second case...don't understand why they quit selling in store?! TL;DR Can't find this in stores
"Tootsie Pops are time-proven suckers that have been around through my generation on into my children's, my grand-children's and now my great-grands'... Just as with books, you can't beat a popular classic!<br /><br />Since each generation of my family loves them, I decided to get this big box for my great-grandsons Devon and Johnny. Their mother promised she would dole them out slowly. I wouldn't want to be responsible for them ingesting too much sugar on a daily basis, so I hope this box lasts a long time.<br /><br />One reviewer did a count of the flavors she got, so I'll just say I'm pleased that Michelle reported there were more of the chocolate and cherry in the box she received. I think most kids prefer chocolate, so that pleased me. I hinted for her to save a few of the cherry ones for me when I come visiting, so perhaps I should go soon. :-)<br /><br />FYI, Devon even liked the apple-flavored Tootsie Pops, but Johnny didn't care for those at all.<br /><br />I don't think anyone could go wrong purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OYMGMC"">Tootsie Pops-Variety Pack, 100 Pops</a>...whether for a gift, an office snack or for the home. And the price is right...<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis<br />Author of ""1106 Grand Boulevard"" and other books TL;DR My grandsons love them... So does Grams!"
"I tried this tea after sampling one from one of my co-workers, it is great! I ordered a few boxes off of amazon since I am an avid coffee drinker and wanted to try a different alternative. Well, I haven't drank or felt the desire to drink any coffee since my first cup of yerba mate this morning.  It also suppressed my appetite; I was not running to the vending machines for my usual 3 PM pick me up.  Definitely give it a try, it is very good, and not bitter at all, some teas if I steep them too long, they become bitter, making me gag, not this tea, the bag sits in the cup all till the last drop.<br />I love it! TL;DR Great stuff!"
Great taste and with the subscription saved money. Recommend to all Tassimo owners. Hopefully Tassmio will; survive the latest issues with the brans. I will hate to be out of the great flavors it offers. TL;DR Great value and taste
"Fruit punch may not be my favorite flavor, but I've been enjoying a daily glass of Vitamin Squeeze as a break from water.  My favorite thing about Vitamin Squeeze is its customizable flavor.  My 15 year old daughter prefers two squeezes in 8 oz, which is twice the recommendation.  I prefer one long squeeze in 16 oz. of water. I don't like a heavy flavor.<br /><br />The bottle was very easy to squeeze, but that was also a negative.  It was hard to control exactly how much you put in.  Some water glasses were more strongly flavored than others.  I appreciate that it immediately disperses in the water, without having to be shaken or stirred.<br /><br />It was very easy to put a little squirt into my toddler's water cup, and know she's enjoying a little flavor along with vitamins.  My children would drink it all day long, if I let them.  I would prefer serving them this rather than a sugary flavored beverage ... but the cost is too high.  My children could easily finish two of the $6 bottles in a week.<br /><br />So, while we enjoy the Vitamin Squeeze, it's not a practical option for our entire family. At least not on a daily basis. TL;DR Easy way to flavor your water, or your kids' water!"
"I'm not usually a tea drinker but the Lipton Pyramid Teas are so delightfully flavored that they could convert anyone....The Harvest Strawberry and Vanilla Caramel <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMD1XW"">Lipton Black Tea, Vanilla Caramel Truffle, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> are my favorite but the others are very good too!!!!!<br />A MUST TRY!!!!!!!! TL;DR Yum"
"I had no problem with the service on my order for Hershey Kisses Dark. However, potential customers should note that Amazon's product description page said (and still says as of this writing)  Item weight 12 pounds.  I didn't receive 12 pounds. What I got was twelve 12-ounce packages = 9 pounds. TL;DR Beware of false item weight"
"This is delicious popcorn -- lost a star because I use a hot air popper and many of them  ""jump"" out before popping.  Great flavor, great texture - tender.  I do not add anything even though I have purchased three different flavored toppings.<br /><br />Thanks, TL;DR Delicious Popcorn"
"The Muir Glen line of fire roasted tomatoes are the highest quality domestic canned tomatoes you will find. The flesh is deep red and flavorful and the Smokey notes from the fire roasting are incredible! I use the diced tomatoes for everything, but the homemade salsa we make with them is to die for, actually better than what we make with our own home grown tomatoes. Very highly recommended.<br /><br />Homemade Roasted Salsa<br /><br />3-cans Muir Glen Organic Diced Tomatoes, Fire Roasted<br />2-cups Roland diced roasted red peppers (drained)<br />Roland Roasted Red Peppers, Diced, 27.5-Ounce Can (Pack of 5)<br />1-large sweet onion diced<br />5-cloves chopped garlic<br />1-teaspoon cumin<br />1-teaspoon chili powder<br />2-tablespoons Empacadora San Marcos Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H27MYI"">Empacadora San Marcos Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce, 11-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Use a stick (or other) blender to puree the Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce (these things have wonderful flavor, but are very hot.

"The K-cup for Keurig Brewers is perfect for our home, as I am usually the only hot beverage consumer.  I had such good luck with the coffee I didn't want to jinx my tea.  I finally made the purchase for the product via Amazon; not only did it arrive swiftly, it tasted great!  Perfecto!  The right amount of tea delivered in a nice hot cup every time.  Cost?  We figured the machine and K-cup paid for themselves already.  The energy it took to boil the water, cost more.  Don't misunderstand, the ritual of making a good fresh pot of tea is still so pleasing, but when you want one cup this is the way to go!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004772OUG"">Celestial Seasonings Tea, Victorian Earl Grey, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> TL;DR I was apprehensive to purchase the tea for my Keurig, so glad I did!"
"I was intially introduced to Pro-Treat Beef Liver Freeze Dried Dog Treats at my veterinarian's office.  Rudy, our Jack Russell Terrior, usually not all that interested in dog treats, responded like I'd never seen before!<br /><br />I bought a couple of cans (they are pretty pricey), but gave them to him sparingly. The tricks he'd do for the Pro-Treats were really entertaining.  Now, Rudy has to take meds. for his glaucoma and thank heavens I found the large size here which is a good value, so he not only takes his medicine, but gives great tricks in return each day! He's a happy camper, despite the loss of sight in one eye.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a><br /><br />Rudy says, ""They are the best part of my day!""

"What they don't tell you: The first three ingredients are:  Beef, Beef Hearts, Water.  They also include Monosoldium glutamate (MSG) and corn syrup.  I wish I had known what was in these. TL;DR INGREDIENTS"
"~Earth's Best Infant Formula Soy Iron, 13.2-Ounce is a great alternative formula for the baby who is lactose intolerant and for the parents who want a formula that is balanced nutritional. It is easily digested even by the most finicky eater.<br /> Our granddaughter had gastric surgery at 3 weeks of age and continued feeding with the formula right after surgery without any problems. The powder easily mixes unlike most formulas.<br />I have bought other Earth's Best products and all are great.<br />At Earth's [...] they have gift baskets sampling of all there products.<br />The Amazon price of the formula for one can is the same online as in my store. But not all stores stock it yet. Thus why I buy online. TL;DR Earth's Best Soy Baby Formula"
"I have drank very many types of Rooibos teas over the past couple of years and Twinings, so far, is my favorite.  It's great hot or cold and especially iced!  I like to drink it with a packet of Sugar in the Raw over crushed ice with just a dash of lemon.  Really smooth and refreshing!  It isn't very strong tea so if that's your thing I would use 2 or 3 bags per serving.  It's caffeine free so it's ok to do that.  Try it out and you'll see! TL;DR Excellent tea, especially iced!"
"We are staunch believers in Weaver's Coffee & Tea -- wife the coffe; husband the tea.  For serious coffee & tea drinkers, there is none better.  Friends say that the deCaf Weaver's is excellent & tastes just like regular coffee.  So, where's the sacrifice?  None!  Fresh roasted guarantees you're not drinking coffee that has sat on shelves for months.  Try it, you'll be believers, too. TL;DR Superior quality product!"
"I usually purchase this from my neighborhood Whole Foods Store. I saw it on here for a comparable price and was going to order something anyway and added it to my order. I started purchasing this brand because it has no alcohol base unlike a lot of the other brands that I have tried, it's more reasonably priced, it doesn't seem (at least to me) to have that bitter aftertaste as strongly as some others and a little goes a long way. I use this in everything, even baking.<br /><br />I noticed also that they sell a granulated ""no bitterness"" baking blend of this brand on Amazon and will have to give that a go as well. A bottle usually lasts me about 6 - 8 weeks (I drink herbal tea on a daily basis) as long as there is no holiday involved...lol. TL;DR Best I Have Used So Far..."
"...and Crazy Mary really must be crazy, or RoJo - not Amazon - is selling old stock with misleading copy ...these blended oils are refreshing, flavorful, and very tasty enhancers in the right dish ...the blends are clearly disclosed on the front label [in the picture] and the back label shows that grapeseed is only 20% ...which is a good thing ... enjoy! TL;DR Dee-lish ..."
"Live bonsai trees just don't survive in a southern climate, when they look sick you add the things you think will make them better, but that just kills them!<br />This tea leaf is really pretty, that's simply a type of tree that you can't find locally, here you might find a small elm or juniper that is suitable for bonsai.<br />With either in a few seasons they are just going to out-grow the pot, but this one never will! TL;DR It looks great and it is never going to die!"
"I've never had any problems with Stevia Extract In The Raw except for the fact that I found out that the product is actually yet another fake ""stevia"" product comprising mostly of corn sugar with a little dash of stevia extract thrown in so the makers can legally call it a stevia product. I have gone back to the tried and true Stevita Supreme brand stevia powder. Four boxes of Stevita Supreme bought on here (shipping included) was about the same price that I would pay for buying four boxes of Stevia Extract In The Raw at my local Kroger, and the Stevita Brand is actually a better product. If you want REAL stevia, go with Stevita Supreme. Stevia Extract In Thr Raw is the best of the faux ""stevia"" products you see in the stores and hasn't given me the gastrointestinal side effects that Truvia and PureVia give me. TL;DR The best of the faux ""stevia"" products (Truvia, PureVia)."
"If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most. This is an ideal additive to diabetic cooking, baking of foods or the mixing of drinks. It is sugar free and calorie free and extremely low in sodium.<br /><br />These mixes are ideal for use in coffee, tea drinks, Italian sodas, cocktails, pancakes, waffles, diabetic cakes, over shaved ice and muffins. You can find a lot of diabetic recipes and substitute these flavorings for ingredients that have more sugar and calories. The result is surprisingly good and it will help reduce your sugar and calorie intake while helping you add more flavor to your food.<br /><br />This flavor is good for baking low calorie muffins or cakes. We also blend 8 ounces of skim milk, a vanilla protein diet mix (About 160 calories), one tablespoon of egg nog mix (No more because of the sugar), two tablespoons of instant sugar free vanilla pudding, 6 ounces of crushed ice, a tablespoon of Da Vinci egg nog syrup for a great tasting egg nog shake. (Blend well)  Makes a nice low calorie lunch!<br /><br />It jazzes up the flavor without adding calories or a lot of salt. It only contains 5 mg of salt. I have attached a photo of the label for your review. You can add more flavoring to suit your taste.<br /><br />Flavorings like these are nice to spice up your low calorie drinks and food and the Da Vinci Gourmet brand is the best we have found. They are internationally recognized as the highest quality flavoring made and one tablespoon = a free food exchange for a diabetic.<br /><br />While this is a 5 star product I disagree with someone charging almost $10 to ship a product that costs $6.49.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this to you as a great product! TL;DR One of my wife's favorite flavors!"
"I'm a coffee drinker, but when I'm in the mood for tea, I like this one. It's packaged well and it stores well. It's fresh and has a rich flavor. I also like to combine it with peppermint tea for a different flavor. TL;DR Coffee Drinker Enjoys This Tea"
"First, there were no instructions whatsoever for this product.  I've used hair oils quite often, but I also know that each brand/formula is different.  I just wanted a little guidance on the quantity to use or when is best to put it on (dry hair or wet hair).  I didn't want to have my hair look greasy, so I did have to wait until I would have the time to rewash my hair in case I used the product and was unhappy with the result.<br /><br />I have used it probably about 4 or 5 times and have tried different amounts and putting on when my hair is wet and when my hair is dry.  It smells good.  The results were just okay, nothing spectacular.  I will definitely be sticking with my favored Moraccanoil brand of oil.  This isn't a terrible option for a cheaper product, though.  It just didn't work as well as my favorite. TL;DR Prefer other brands of hair oil"
I drink this tea every day.  It is great to never run out & never pay to much. TL;DR Great price & fresh
"Maybe we're the only ones that actually enlarged the photo of the 35 K Cups before we placed our order.  We wanted to make sure that the variety was indeed something that we felt we would enjoy.  Obviously ""variety"" is just that, various flavors.  However we did expect to at least receive ONE of each flavor shown on the photo, and we did NOT expect to receive SEVEN pumpkin spice, FIVE eggnog, and FIVE Gingerbread (none of which are in the display photo) when placing our very first order with Amazon in January!  Of the 35 K Cups, 17 (almost half) were holiday flavors - I mean, come on at least be honest enough to promote the product as ""nearing experation holiday coffee samplers that we can't get rid of...here's hoping you won't notice"".  Seriously, give a little credit to the intelligience of your customers, or in our case ""first and only orders"". TL;DR Photo of selection is VERY misleading"
"Purchased as a gift for that 'hard to get for' person. He loved it, used it up rather quickly adding it into lots of things. I also enjoyed some of the creations he made with it. A very nice not super spicy wing sauce also. You can have spice without heat - and it's in this bottle. TL;DR Purchased as a gift"
"The dogs love the beef flavor and want more, but due to their small weight, they only require one snack.  Great product!! TL;DR Dogs love it!!!"
"My family loved these crackers.  Gluten free crackers are pretty expensive and we eat a lot of them.  So, having some of our groceries delivered by Amazon is certainly nice! TL;DR great taste"
"I found these snacks on a jetblue flight and since then they have been my primary snacking chip. They are have pretty much healthy snacks for you because their is nothing bad in them. It is quite amazing and they are even gluten free for people that need good snacks like that.<br /><br />The most important part is they are delicious. I can't quite describe them, but they beat anything else out there. They also solved my old Doritos problem where the chips would slice the roof of my mouth...... TL;DR Medora Snacks - Cheesy Jalapeno"
"Stocked up on crackers at the excellent Amazon Grocery price in anticipation of the holiday parties and drop-in guests. Simple snack to have on hand for soups, cheese, and dips. Who doesn't love the buttery goodness of a Club Cracker.  Seriously, just good. No problems in shipping, arrived in great conditioned and wrapped in plastic. If you like to buy in bulk (or are expecting a house full this holiday season), this pack of four will serve you well. Pricing, shipping, and quality all great. Enjoy! TL;DR Great Price. Survived Shipping Well."
This cake is delicious. It is so moist and the texture is perfect. It also stayed fresh for a couple of days and tasted just as good days later. My youngest daughter (6yo) can't eat wheat. She loved this cake and is begging me to make it again. My older daughter who can eat wheat but doesn't really like any kind of chocolate cake ate it and thought it was one of the best cakes she's ever had. She won't eat a wheat chocolate cake but she loves this. It's that good! I'm thrilled because everyone loved it. You could easily serve this at a kids birthday party and no one would ever know it was GF. TL;DR Best EVER !!!
"Wakame seaweed is amazingly delicious and this product is no exception. Reconstitution only takes about 10-15 minutes, drain it, and you're ready to eat! TL;DR Yum!"
"I used to track kidney beans in stores, but didn't succeed, only canned and cooked. So it was good to see it on Amazon!<br /><br />You should include red kidney beans in your regular meal plan because of its core nutritions contained, high protein and minerals, especially iron, for the latter. And I believe Eden kidney beans are natural products by its taste and the appearance before and after cooking.<br /><br />Very good product and reasonable pricing. TL;DR Eden Kidney Beans"
"I ordered this thinking I was getting green tea. Actually it's a blend of many ""teas."" Green tea is not even listed as an ingredient. The blend is not bad, however its not what I think of as green tea. TL;DR Not green tea"
"I ordered this product from Amazon because we are not able to find the original Cream of Wheat in local stores. Apparently the manufacturer drastically modified the product but left the packaging the same. I ordered this based on the reviews. Don't believe it! The flavor, consistency, aroma -- all different. It clumps up as soon as you put it the liquid. Impossible to get smooth. This is what I imagine baby pablum tastes like. NOT ORIGINAL, someone should sue the manufacturer for false advertising! TL;DR Not same as Grandma's!"
"My son loves these puffs. They are organic, contain very low sugar, and even the container is bpa free. I have had a few problems with the lids popping off which resulted in lost puffs and sometimes the puffs go stale quickly. I contacted the manufacturer and was told that they were aware of the problem and have since fixed it. I have yet to receive a new shipment to test it out. TL;DR Son loves them"
My family loves this mac and cheese.  It's a nice change from 'orange' and they like the shell-shaped pasta. I bought it because it's 'totally natural' but the taste is great and keeps us coming back! TL;DR Yummy!
"FOLLOW-UP TO THE BELOW REVIEW:<br />Two days later:<br />4 STAR RATING:  I also contacted Hawaiian Roasters and they immediately got back to me. They found out that Amazon had not thrown away a batch of coffee back in September and I had received a bag of it. While I have received a refund from Amazon, Hawaiian Roasters is also sending me a replacement bag of coffee. Excellent customer service.  I received the new bag and it was very good.<br /><br />ONE STAR RATING:  I first ordered this coffee during the 2010 Holiday Season and liked it so much that I gave several pounds as gifts.  In fact, we liked it so much that we decided to do the automatic order every other month.  I would have chosen every month, but at almost $30.00 per pound, I just couldn't quite justify it.  My February order just arrived and I anxiously opened it up.  Where is the rich coffee smell that should be permeating the kitchen?  It just isn't there.  It actually has that old, rancid smell.  You know the one; like oil that has gone bad.  Upon close inspection of the package, I found out why it has this smell.  The dark roasted date on the bottom of the package?  June 15, 2010!!  This coffee was roasted 8 months ago!<br /><br />Needless to say, I immediately contacted Amazon, demanded a refund and canceled any future orders.  This is really too bad because when this coffee is fresh, it is delicious.  What a shame that they believe they can foist old product off on supposedly unsuspecting customers.  They should know that people who pay this much for coffee probably know old coffee when they smell it.  Get a clue, Amazon. TL;DR Fourth order foul BUT HAWAII ROASTERS FOLLOW-UP EXCELLENT"
"My family has been on the gluten-free diet for the past nine years. I have spent literally hundreds of dollars trying out various brands of wheat/gluten free pasta - that have generally ended up in the trash. I even quit trying to find a good substitute for a long time. UNTIL a friend suggested I try this brand. I was skeptical, but it tasted great. It won the approval of every member of the household, even my husband who isn't gluten intolerant.<br /><br />I have tried 6 shapes of the pasta and they have all been consistently good. I can make spaghetti, mac & cheese, casseroles, lasagna and all of the other foods we used to enjoy before going GF. I follow the cooking times listed on the package, and I have never had a problem with mushiness, or the pasta being undercooked in the center. If I am going to bake the pasta after I've boiled it, I cut down on the boil time by 2-3 minutes. There is NO CORN in this pasta, so if that is  concern for you - know that you can purchase this!<br /><br />I really do love these pastas and I hope your family will too! TL;DR Don't even bother to try another brand!"
"My sister and I are gluten-free, and we both dislike a lot of the gluten-free flours.  I was delighted when a friend served me some pancakes that contained this flour - it tasted mostly normal!  It isn't gritty like some gf flours, and it works in just about everything.  We both feel like this is the closest to good old wheat flour as we are going to get. TL;DR Best gf all-purpose blend"
"These are the most delicious olives I've ever eaten and unlike any others. Before I discovered them in 2005, I was an active olive-hater. Graber's delicate brine doesn't overwhelm the succulence of their perfect fruit. Once you try these you'll be craving them... fair warning. TL;DR Graber made an olive-lover of me"
"My 4 month poodle puppy loves Stella & Chewy's. Patties are easy to use.<br />My daughter suggested this particular dog food. She is pro "" good for you and natural"" foods.<br />Although I feel it is very ""pricey"", I plan to keep using it as long as possible.<br />Purchasing this on Amazon was easier than finding locally.<br />The only down side is that the patties break and crumble easily, particularly when shipped, but your get used to the amount you use each feeding and it is not a problem. TL;DR Not cheap but worth the price"
"Ordered a 12-pack of these traps from Amazon after reading the reviews.  We just purchased a 120 year old house over the summer, and have been seeing a lot of cave spiders in the basement.  I put all 12 traps out in various parts of the basement (crawl space, laundry area, utility room, and living area).  For about a week I kept checking them but only found one or two bugs, somewhat disappointed but at least it didn't cost me much.  I checked again after about 2 weeks, and was shocked to see that several of the traps were almost filled with bugs (spiders, crickets, beetles).  There are a few traps that haven't been touched, but I will definitely be ordering some additional traps to replace the ones that saw a lot of activity. TL;DR Traps are working well"
"The best part is that you only need half a cup of the stuff to get all the benefits, unlike most of the competitors which usually recommends at least a one cup serving.<br /><br />This means half the calories, allowing you to suppliment the taste with fruit or jelly without busting your diet, and twice as many servings in the same sized box.<br /><br />And it really tastes better than some other high fiber cereals that I could mention... TL;DR Good in so many ways..."
"I admit to being old fashioned. My espresso maker is a Krups Il Caffe Duomo. It's a great little machine and it makes great espresso. I have tried at least 6 different kinds of espresso from the national brand where the baristas wear green aprons to most of the others. I settled on Illy because it was the first espresso made, back in the day, and it comes from Italy. The grind is very fine so you will need a basket that can hold fine espresso. If you are familiar with a burr coffee grinder, I will bet that this coffee is ground on a setting of 1.<br /><br />Don't talk to me about pods. Illy makes them but I like this espresso in the can. When you pop the lid, close your eyes and the aroma will take you to a bar in Italy. When you drink the resulting brew, it will have the same effect. It is the real deal and I buy it all the time. TL;DR Old Fashioned - Press, Steam, Drink"
"I am a vegetarian and a fan of indian food, so I decided to try this sample pack of Kitchens of India food products. I find it difficult to come across a deal that involves all vegetarian friendly foods, and so I purchased this when it was in the Daily Deals section. The vegetable curry was the best of the six, and I got them for a decent price, so I am happy with my purchase. TL;DR Good little variety pack for vegetarians."
"*****<br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent ""natural flavors"" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. China Green Tips delivers this in a cleaner, purer way than Tazo's other teas. I liked this green tea!<br /><br />The ingredients in China Green Tips are simply spring-harvested green teas from China. It contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague and unnecessary for a super premium tea. China Green Tips has none of these ""natural flavors"" and it shows in the quality and cleanliness of the tea experience.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a traditional Chinese green tea with a delicate fresh taste and a light green liquor."" This is the perfect way to describe this tea! On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of China Green Tips as ""grassy, vegetative, sweet, ricey"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""vegetative, popcorn"".<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi or Aspen. Still, this tea is excellent, so I'm breaking my tradition with Tazo teas and giving it five stars. If you enjoy super premium teas, and are stuck with Tazo for some reason, choose China Green Tips and you will be quite satisfied. I can't honestly say that about any other Tazo tea.<br />***** TL;DR Great Green Tea Experience, Tazo's Best"
I don't have sodium issues but it's better not to create any either! That's why I puchased this product. It seasons well. I use it as a rub also (mixed with a bit of extra virgin olive oil) for my skinless chicken and fish. The bottle is small but packs a bunch in flavor! Great on veggies too! TL;DR Keep it at the table!!
"This is exactly what I needed for my cat's litter.  It allows for easy, quick sifting that eliminates scooping.  It works best with clumping litter. TL;DR Sifting Cat Litter Pan"
"I've tried several different Dr. McDougall noodle and soup entrees and this is one of the better ones.  They're easy to make, Just peel back the foil covering from the top of the cup, add the flavor packet that's inside and stir a bit.  Add water to the fill line and microwave for 1 minute and 45 seconds.  Then stir and let stand for 5 minutes.  You could also add boiling water to the fill line and then let it stand. I added more water than suggested to make it more of a soup and this seemed to work out well.  They aren't as spicy as I like so I added a few drops of Tabasco.<br /><br />I like that these are vegan and that they're easy to store in the pantry for when you don't know what else to make or when you're in a hurry.  They would also be good to take along when traveling and could easily be made in a hotel room with hot water from the coffee maker on if you have a microwave in your room.  They're 200 calories per cup, so they could also make a quick diet lunch or dinner, maybe paired with a green salad. TL;DR Easy fast food on the go"
"this hot sauce is great im new to the extreme heat sauces but i have previously tried fear sauce which has 1,100,000 scoville units and this sauce is by far alot hotter just two drops mixed with a little salsa on my taco had my mouth on fire its unlikely 4,000,000 scoville probaly more like 2,000,000 but i would  recommend this product TL;DR Great Heat Level!!!!"
This is my second time ordering this exact product and it is a great economical product to use in my bath bombs for the holiday gift baskets I make.  Perfect project citric acid! TL;DR Great Product!
"This a wonderful, smoky salt. You can smell how smoky it is when you open the package. It has a finer texture than some other salts, and seems saltier as well. I don't eat meat, but I imagine it would be wonderful on hearty, savory meat dishes like beef and bar-b-que. I love it on cooked greens, and grilled veggies, especially portabello mushrooms. Adds alot of flavor to boring popcorn, too. A good purchase, and attractive packaging as well. The bottom of the container is magnetized, so you can stick it to the fridge, or on the stands that are sold separately. TL;DR Definitely Smoky!"
"I used to live in Winchester, KY as a kid...  I was actually born and raised there, but moved to Montana in my early 20's...  I moved back to Lexington, KY a while ago and can enjoy this anytime now...  I'm very fortunate in that aspect, but out west it was so hard to be w/o...  Can't say enough about how good this product is...  Very good for mixing w/ some good old Shine or Bourbon...  It's a ginger ale, but nothing like your typical variety...<br /><br />give it a try and see for yourself!!! TL;DR Miss KY, but this helps bring me home..."
It is an okay dog food. But it was not the number one choice of the three I tried for my dogs. TL;DR Natural Life Adult Dog Food
"My son has thick black hair, so it is a constant battle to keep the dandruff under control. He has tried most of the products out there relying heavily on Head & Shoulders as his go-to shampoo of choice. According to my 16-year-old, he much prefers this shampoo for the following reasons. First, the scent is not overpowering. It's a clean-smelling fragrance that lasts throughout the day. Secondly, it doesn't tingle when applied. He is not a big fan of those types of shampoos. Finally, the product works. His dandruff is under control and his hair looks and smells clean. Two thumbs up from my son. TL;DR Teenager approved!"
"I ordered this because I ran out of another brand of Huckleberry tea and temporarily couldn't find it for awhile.  I assumed all Huckleberry teas would taste the same.  This was not very good comparatively.  If I'm allowed to mention the other brand, it is from Chris' Tea Cottage (Bigfork, Montana)  You can find them on web search. TL;DR Disappointed"
I have found this to be the best tea extract out there for the money.  I have tried several that didnt seem as potent or have an effect but this one is excellent TL;DR Nice buy for the money
"I do not like pre-cooked pork rinds, not even made fresh in the Mexican Carnecerias, but hubby likes them, so I decided to buy these.<br /><br />I was shocked to find that they were light, airy and crispy. Some bags were saltier than others, but we've cooked up about 5 so far and the majority aren't overly salty.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned watching them to figure out how long the cooking time should be. In our 1100 watt oven 40-43 seconds seems to be just right.<br /><br />The key is to take them out the moment the bag has fully inflated. Leave them in too long and you end up with charcoal and not enough time will make them gummy.<br /><br />Since I follow a fairly low carb regimen for health and weight reasons, I like the fact that these can be a perfect vehicle for guacamole and salsa without the carbs. I'm still trying to come up with more dip ideas that will go well with the flavoring.<br /><br />I wish they'd put out a version that didn't have seasoned salt as I'd like them with just salt and/or garlic. TL;DR Amazingly Good!"
"I love Ginger flavor and these candies deliver. The flavor is sweet but strong which sometimes brings water to my eyes and makes me cough a bit. They really have a nice, smooth flavor, with no bitterness.<br /><br />Ginger has been used by many cultures all over the world for medicinal purposes. My personal experience is that these candies help quell nausea. There are times when no pills or even water will go down, but I can suck on a few of these and the nausea eases up so I can then take the required meds.<br /><br />Also, when it comes to times that my asthma is acting up and I have taken all meds as directed but not gotten relief, sucking on a few of them seems to help clear the air ways a bit. This may just be specific to me.<br /><br />Most importantly these things just plain taste great. Once I start eating them it is tough to stop.<br /><br />Note on sellers: I ordered from an alternate vendor by mistake recently. What I received was a clear plastic bag with no product information or markings of any kind filled with some kind of Ginger drops that looked a tad beat up. It took well over a week to arrive when Claey's delivers within a few days. I'd highly recommend sticking with buying directly from Claey's. Their packaging is great, they are very responsive in quickly filling orders, and their candies are top notch. TL;DR Strong Ginger Taste, no bitterness, delicious!"
The day I made a mistake and started feeding her you'd think was a Fancy Feast addict and would start jonesing for her Fancy Feast dinner fix.  She knows somehow when it is time and becomes insufferable until I open the can.  Then she starts meowing like crazy as if she were starving her.<br />She has thrived on this stuff.  Her coat is very soft and shiny and she is very frisky for an older cat.  In cat years she is middle aged.<br />I may have to start buying in bulk to save money right now I subscribe to 3 different ones over a three month period but will be adding one soon for variety.  I figured it out and if you subscribe it is cheaper than Sam's club warehouse. TL;DR My cat is hooked on the stuff.
"I love Iams dog food for a good quality ""over the counter"" dog food.  When my dogs reached the mature age of 6 and 7 I decided to put them on this formula.<br /><br />Their teeth, coats and weight have all maintained to my standards.  1 of my older dogs (now 7) is loosing teeth and she can still eat this and loves it. TL;DR Great for health and coats"
"This is probably the best tasting apple juice ever!  I could not stop drinking and finished 8 bottles in a matter of weeks.  Tastes better than Mott's, Tropicana, Very Fine, etc...  I've tried them all.  My only issue is that the price has steadily risen since I initially purchased through Amazon Subscribe.  For that reason I can no longer afford.  5 stars for taste, 3 stars for price. TL;DR Great taste but expensive"
"Every Sunday is pancake day and this product produces consistent, delicious, and quick results.  I know, you can make them from scratch, from a bag, and also from a box.  This product ensures that pancakes taste good all the time.  And how many things do you know you can count on week to week? TL;DR Love the ease of use!"
"After some research, I changed my cat to this shortly after I got her from the Humane Society, which sent her home with some Purina, or something. We both love it. She'll eat it all day and night, and she's stayed super healthy.<br /><br />One thing though is to watch portion sizes. When I got my cat, she was barely 5 pounds. I was feeding her 3 times a day, a quarter cup each, and she started growing really fast. When she hit 10 pounds, I dropped down to twice a day, still a quarter cup each. Eventually she got to 13 pounds and was starting to look pudgy. I dropped her down to a quarter cup in the morning and half of that at night, and she's stayed consistent at about 11 pounds and well proportioned. That's about half of what the bag says a cat of her age and weight ""should"" eat. I feel that if she ate all that she would get fat.<br /><br />Watch how much you feed your cat, adjust portions to their activity level, and be sure they have plenty of water. This cat food is not the cheapest, but it's very good. For my money, I won't buy anything else. TL;DR We Love It"
I use this oil daily on my face and body. It really does keep my skin in good condition.<br />I also take this oil by mouth with a couple drops of Agave nectar. Coconut oil is a very healthy oil.<br />I have tried several different Coconut oils and they are pretty good but I favor this one. TL;DR Great Product
"My dog loves Merrick treats-any and all of them.  They are expensive but pay big time in tail wags.  If my dog could talk she would say ""buy them and drive your dog crazy!"".  Great for training!  My dog focuses on me and looks for clues to whether I am getting that bag or not! TL;DR Drive your Dog Crazy"
"We tried this package's brother first, the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052F8JXI"">Velveeta Cheesy Skillets Ultimate Cheeseburger Mac</a>.  This one was better; my wife and kids agree.  We will definitely look for this one again, but will pump it up to better suit our personal tastes.<br /><br />Although the instructions say one pound of chicken, I went for poultry broke and used a package of 2.47 pounds.  Yes, call me wild, reckless, impetuous, whatever.  Given the fact that the instructions for the amount of water are based on what the orzo and broccoli will soak up, the extra chicken didn't do anything to the recipe, and actually made the finished dish a lot better.  So, I advise that you use at least two pounds of chicken when you cook this kit.<br /><br />Also, the instructions advise to cut the chicken into 1-inch pieces.  I did that, and they came out pretty big, as in pretty big bite-size.  I advise to cut the chicken into ½-inch pieces, and you'll get better distribution throughout the dish.  Smaller pieces also will cut the cooking time.<br /><br />It cooks up just fine, although my cooking time was quite a bit more than indicated on the box.  Total time for me, from the first of the chicken browning until serving was about an hour.  Consider, though, that I used more chicken than advised which likely affected the overall cooking time as indicated on the box's directions.  Yes, it was worth the prep time and wait.<br /><br />The seasoning ingredients are passable, smelling in the pouch an awful lot like canned parmesan cheese, with a hint of celery and parsley.  The orzo plumped up very nicely and filled out the dish well.  The broccoli florets were the only real surprise in the package, coming in a very small envelope and coming out a lot more like ground-up spice bits than the broccoli I thought I'd be getting.  Actually, the box's depiction is about right in terms of broccoli size and distribution.  This package's broccoli will not suffice for your USDA-recommended vegetable intake; it lends color and a small amount of texture to the dish, but to my experience offered no additional taste.  The product's title is ""chicken and broccoli,"" but the ratio is far from equal.<br /><br />The Velveeta cheez pouch was squishy and cheezy and ample; I was surprised by the amount of cheez I was squeezing into the dish.  But hey, it melted down just fine and mixed in with the dish in no time, glomming it all together super-American-style.  As it did this, I was thinking that mixing it with some cream of mushroom soup, dropping the entire thing into a casserole dish, covering it with a top layer of cheez and some fried onions would really make this something cool; I'll have to try this.  Your results may vary.<br /><br />Taste: This stuff was just fine by itself, although my wife noticed immediately that it was pretty bland.  Like, really bland.  Given that I was cooking this for a review, I intentionally did not experiment with the kit (other than my highly irresponsible and psychotically dangerous use of twice the amount of recipe-specified chicken, and a good three tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil to cook the chicken, and I didn't drain it, leaving the juices and olive oil to join the dish, which  I recommend you do, too).  Yeah, it's pretty bland, but not bad at all, and it's got a lot of potential.  So, I recommend that you up-spice it to fit your own personal needs.  That might mean some salt and pepper.  If and when I make this again, I'll saut&eacute; some onions with the chicken, maybe add some fresh sliced mushrooms, and I'll definitely drop in some garlic, black pepper, caraway seeds, and maybe even a dash of powdered cayenne pepper to give this dish some action.<br /><br />Bottom line: in the dinner kit market, this one isn't really that remarkable.  Follow the simple instructions and you'll end up with a suitably tasty and largely unremarkable dinner for 3 or 4.  But, make a few tweaks for your personal tastes, and you'll end up with something much better. TL;DR Good Stuff, Easy, but Even Better with Customization"
"This ice cream mix is very easy to use.  just use milk or half and half.  for those non-dairy people, i recommend almond milk (still yummy.) TL;DR Simple but great tasting."
"My favorite k-cup flavor of all. While I will drink this in the morning before work, I think it is best enjoyed after dinner while relaxing.  Nothing more be said. TL;DR Favorite flavor"
I have been experimenting with various coffees for over a year now and this coffee is amongst the best I've tried. It's not oily like some I've tested and has a full bodied flavor without an unpleasent after taste. I like this coffee enough that I will be ordering it again. That's not to say I won't keep testing other coffees but it nice to know that I've found one that I can order knowing I will enjoy every cup. TL;DR Very pleasent coffee
"I don't see any reason for 3 colors, plastic stick to remove<br />Kap or brush. I would rather have paid 5 bucks for 1 Kap.<br />Kind of expensive for what is is. TL;DR Kap works"
"I learned recently that cats are not supposed to have GRAINS in their food. It causes them health problems, including weight problems. The first few days of trying this I couldn't decide if they were liking it or not. They had always eaten dry food. After a few days on this canned they really started to show that they were liking it. It is a little chunky, but the chunks are easily smoothed out - it's also better to add some warm water with this to make it a little soupy. If it has been refrigerated, let it get to room temperature. All 3 cats like this as well as the Tuna Too Cool and the one that has Shrimp and Chicken combined - but they didn't like salmon. TL;DR They like it!"
"I have two cardis, one of whom is a strong chewer. I've always been a believer in the Nylabone toys, having seen my parents give them to their dogs over my entire life. Never had a problem. When my male cardi was a puppy, I gave him a regular bone-shaped Nylabone toy. He prompted chewed a large chunk off the knobby end of the bone and swallowed it. What an expensive fiasco that was. I had to take the Nylabones from him completely... until we found these rings. Now he can enjoy chewing the toy without getting large pieces off. When it looks like he might chew through the ring, I just throw it away and give him a new one. He gets his fix and I don't have to worry! TL;DR Safest Nylabone"
"Awesome coffee.  If you like strong - flavorable coffee, this is it.  Gave a can to my Dad and he loves it and wants me to order more. TL;DR Awesome!"
This is a delicious tea that is nice hot or cold. It has a wonderful floral taste and smells lovely. It does seem to help my skin as well. I save the teabags and use them in my skin care regimen. One of my favorite yogi teas. TL;DR Just lovely
"I am disappointed in the most recent shipment I received of the Smokehouse Lamb Munchies.  I have purchased them numerous times in the past however this last shipment of 4 lbs has 1/2 of the bags in little crumb pieces and the big pieces aren't much better.  The packages typically contain large pieces that I cut up, with this shipment all you do is grab a handful of little tiny pieces. I will have to think twice before I purchase these again, I likely would try 1 lb before I buy quantity again. TL;DR Smokehouse review"
"This product is just as it states, just remember it will not work until you draw all the moisutre our of your sea salt. (meaning work in your pepper mill or grinder) To do so, heat oven to 250, put salt on baking sheet, put in oven, turn oven off...Simple TL;DR Great after you take the Moisture Out"
"I purchased the Miracle Noodle Spinach angel hair pasta.  I looked at many of the reviews prior to making my first bag.  I did find that they have a strong fish odor upon opening.  This was expected.  I rinsed the noodles under cole water for 4-5 minutes.  The odor decreased significantly.  I boiled the noodles for about 7 minutes then rinsed under cold water.  While boiling, I added a dry garlic rub so that the noodles may take in some of the flavor.  After boiling, I rinsed the noodles under cold water for 30 seconds or so.  To finish, I added about 1-1.5 teaspoons of garlic cooking creme, red pesto with truffles, and a touch of basil garlic parmasean dipping oil.  I warmed the noodle-sauce mixture for about 5-10 minutes.  I admit, the noodle texture was interesting...I guess it was like an al dente ramen noodle.  I wasn't expecting a spaghetti noodle though.  I would definitely make again. TL;DR Not Bad, Not Bad At All"
item was exacty what i expected. candy was soft and fresh. package came really fast. only drawback is the bag isn't re-sealable but you can put it in a ziploc bag or canister. i still have some and they are still as fresh as the day i got them. TL;DR great
"Organic freeze-dried corn is a wonderful snack. I eat it instead of tortilla chips. Organic freeze dried corn tastes great and I usually eat it right out of the bag.<br /><br />Organic freeze dried corn has a light, airy texture that practically melts in your mouth. It has a fresh taste that reminds me of sweet corn right from the garden.<br /><br />Freeze-dried corn can also be added to your favorite recipes. And it will remain fresh when stored for long periods of time.<br /><br />But Sensible Foods Organic Sweet Corn, at several dollars for 0.75-Ounce, is way overpriced.<br /><br />Check out ""Organic Just Corn"" by a company called Just Tomatoes. Amazon sells it now. The product is just as good as this one and you get about 5 times as much for the price. The quality is as good or better IMO.<br /><br />Another option is Now Food Non-GMO Freeze Dried Corn -- but that is not organic. It tastes great, but I prefer organic. TL;DR There are equal products that are less expensive"
"6/5 stars for the seeds, 1 star for the seller (false advertising).<br />I bought the 3lb version that had the resealable bag as pictured, paid the extra money for it, and still received the cheaper bulk transparent bag version... Was looking to conceal freshness, but just ended up overpaying, and the shipping was very much delayed. TL;DR Awesome seeds, terrible seller"
When I first got this container of Matcha I thought it was a lot to pay for such a small container. Let me tell you..a little bit goes a long way! Matcha green tea is also much more flavourful than brewing tea from a teabag.  I have also found many recipes that call for green tea powder and this has worked out well. I would say the price I paid is well worth the wonderful matcha that I purchased. TL;DR Good things come in small packages
"After following Geoff Klos's instruction, got the first mole in two weeks.  Thanks for sharing the technique.  This product works, but patience is the key.  It's a bit difficult to set, but in order to provide the clamping force and speed required, I guess it's necessary to have such strong spring. TL;DR It works"
"I'm a tea enthusiast, and after having an expensive peach white tea from a specialty tea shop, I was hooked on the combination.  After depleting my supply, I came across this Lipton Mango Peach at the grocery store and thought I would at least give it a go.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, but this tea really did exeed my expectations!  I can't quite taste the mango, but the peach flavor is there.  The tea is light, and not overpowering (I'm not a fan of fruit teas that are so strong they mask the tea flavor).  I add a bit of stevia to sweeten, and I'm good to go!  It is a very smooth cup, and I find it relaxing.  It also makes a yummy iced tea! TL;DR Great tea!"
"I love it. They both taste AWSOME. The cranberry sesame mix is slightly salty and the cherry apple mix is more on the sweeter side. I am a BIG FAN of SAHALE SNACKS. i find them to be tastey and nutritious. They are great to keep in your bag for work or play. They are great for a long car drive and a fun snack to give away. I understand there is sort of a cult following with Sahale, so I loke to give them away to people to spread the word. TL;DR Sahale strikes again!"
"My dogs (all 6 of them) love Himalayan Chews, the hard bones, so I thought I would try these as a bonus treat and they scarffed them down in record time. They also sell a powder you can sprinkle on their dry food which they seem to find quite tasty too.  Of course these aren't the pickiest dogs you will ever meet, but they do really like all the Himalayan products a lot TL;DR my furbabies love them"
"This is pretty damn expensive for what you get (I know of few other single-ingredient spices that go for $5/oz).  However, if you like green chili powder on stuff, you'll love it.  It tastes good on everything! TL;DR Delicious"
"In my opinion, Yuban is the best tasting of all the everyday coffees for home or office. In the aroma and flavor categories, Yuban beats Maxwell House and Foldgers hands down! But, honestly, who the heck would pay the prices listed by these sellers? $75 for two 33oz cans of Yuban... seriously?! Locally, I buy the 44oz can of Yuban for $10.49 at a discount grocery or, if I'm hard up, just a litter more than $12 for a 33oz can at any of the corporate grocery stores. When I read one review stating that the price on Amazon.com was good, I thought to myself that this person either has money to burn or is just plain clueless about the cost of goods. TL;DR Best tasting everyday coffee!"
"I sometimes use these for baking, but more often just enjoy eating a square right out of the bag.  If your recipe calls for chopped candied/crystallized ginger you will need to cut these into smaller pieces.  I use a slap chopper, and it works well, but it will get really gummy if you are trying to chop a large quantity.  The baking chips are much easier to use, but you will also get a little added sugar if you go the other route.<br /><br />These are delicious right out of the bag, and I always keep a bag when traveling to help with any motion sickness, or travel upset.  Plus, they're wonderfully tasty.  I don't need an excuse to eat them! TL;DR Delicious right out of the bag"
This is the preferred coffee for our family.  I am unable to obtain it at the local groceries and found it to be competetively priced at Amazon with no shipping charges. TL;DR Eight o'clock decaf
"This is great stuff. You really cannot tell the difference from this and regular pasta. It is not filled with too much fiber so you get over full or gas pains. It is made by a patented process that relies on technology that creates a matrix in the grain that does not allow absorption of the carbs (I have no idea what that means), they pass through without the sugar levels rising like regular macaroni. I have diabetes type 2 and this is a savior. My blood sugar for example was 109 before eating this and after 1 hour was 122, after 2 hours it was 107. I usually have it with a marinara or meat sauce but even plain with garlic and butter this tastes wonderful! Simply amazing stuff! TL;DR The best for low carb or diabetic diets..tastes exactly the same as regular pasta!"
"My cats like this cat food but darn, it's difficult to take the foil tops off the little tubs.  I can't imagine how anyone who has arthritis could use this product. TL;DR My cats like it"
"This coffee is a good choice for your morning cup, but isn't as great as some of the other offerings: Gevalia or Starbucks. However, at this price, I'm very happy with it. TL;DR Good coffee, great price"
"I got this product because I used to buy chia water in Kreation cafe, and they sell one bottle for like $6. This little bag can make at least c hundred of these bottles, if not much more. What a great saving! I make a bottle (or two) of chia water, add agave syrup and stevia to it and slowly drink throughout the day. These seeds have so many benefits! And I LOVE the smooth sensation of them on my tongue. It's a fun water, and I am buying more. For now I have been using it for about 2 weeks, and my bag is still almost fool. TL;DR What an amazing product!"
"Ok... the laxative effect is a secondary sweetener called maltitol. It is known to cause a laxative effect. Its very similar to sugar so it can be used in the same manner. However it is known to cause irritation on the GI. Maltitol is a very slow absorbing sugar and excess can cause gas, bloating and diarrhea. However, these jelly beans are delicious and taste very similar to the non-sugarfree variety. But, as the other reviewers cautioned self-discipline is going to be heavily recommended. These things are extremely powerful. On my first go I was warned by a friend who told me he had a bag and he almost died. I didn't believe him and I had a whole bag of these delicious beans... before I continue... go ahead and read the warnings on the bag. It suggests no more than 8 beans at a time... I tested this and it was best way to go and caused no problems. HOWEVER, if you DO consume a whole bag prepare for several hours of repeated bathroom visits, bloating like if your intestines were going to explode and and severe intestinal gas. So, go ahead enjoy a couple from time to time and it will be a very good purchase. But again, caution and self control! TL;DR Delicious but laxative effect is explained."
"I love these, and the really special part is that I am originally from Traverse City and my father had a cherry orchard. I used to purchase them when I would visit, so I am thrilled that I can find the same product online. Cherries are great for snacks, salads, etc. TL;DR A repeat purchase for me"
"It grew in just a few days and looked great, but my cat throws the grass back up! Apparently its not for every cat! TL;DR Cat throws is back up!"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016PC4TS"">Havahart Critter Ridder 3146 Animal Repellent, 5-Pounds Granular Shaker</a><br />Pretty good solution to deterring squirrels and other small critters from digging and hanging around your gardens without killing them.  This was a re-order, and I'd do it again. TL;DR Rid your garden of critters"
"Ok these trays are SMALL and better suited for small to medium breed doggies. They are each the size of a dime. They are bait tiny for my large breed doggie but he eats them and likes them, so they seem to please a dogs taste buds. I would not buy them again because they are too small for my dog, but someone with a little dog will most likely love them. They are also low fat so they are great for dogs on diets. TL;DR Good treats, small, but healthy"
Service prompt. Had to pay to send incorrect order back. Disappointed in product; not all flavors in box as described TL;DR Charms Sweet Pops
"I am afraid this tea does not have flavor of Earl Grey.  If you want to make a strong tea, the bitter taste will come out.  The tea smells wonderful in a bag, but somewhat its aroma went away once it brewed. TL;DR The tea smells wonderful, but loses aroma once it brewed."
"Was sent the LOW FAT version of this and thought it was a mistake.  Had a replacement order sent and it is the same issue.  The regular is made with lean chicken, but is not the low fat version.  The ones I had sent do not read ""Made with a good source of protein,"" the say ""Low Fat.""  The low fat version of this soup is horrible and copious amounts of seasonings can not save it. TL;DR Wrong item listed!!!!"
These drawers are stackable and make the kitchen look neat and in order. They hold 36<br />In each holder and it is very easy to keep track<br />of when amounts get low . TL;DR Great Coffee Drawers
"I ordered this bouquet for my mom's birthday. They lasted well over 2 weeks. I ordered them without the vase, and they came in a beautiful box with tissue paper and flower food, ready to set in a vase. My only complaint is that they did not include a card with my Happy Birthday message. TL;DR lasted well over 2 weeks"
"Not usually a fan of the starbucks brand but this looked promising. Glad I tried it, it is absolutely superb. Strong, bold and no aftertaste. So unlike starbucks usual junk. Have never seen this before but this goes directly to my regular orders column. Superb,!!! TL;DR OK I'm a fan"
this is a horrible price for fancy feast...paying over $0.60 a can is terrible!  better off going to Walmart or Target and spending $0.50.  it adds up. TL;DR bad rating for price only...my cats love fancy feast
It has a good taste overall.  There seems to be a bit too much filler/rice in the mix.  It takes away from the granola felling and taste that you might expect.<br />Its not a bad product and the organic aspect is great.  Its just not regular granola. TL;DR not your traditional granola
"I think it is no fresh,no good.Maybe this granola made a long time,so the taste is very bad.I'm depressed that I bought 24 bags. TL;DR Very bad."
I first used these bags when they were offered free at the dog park and then the park replaced them with another brand. I have been buying them ever since. They are biodegradable and just the right size. TL;DR Go Green
I think I've ordered these at least three times.  They are my favorite.  My husband is definitely NOT a vegan and he thinks they are awesome too.  I think these have just the right amount of dark chocolate to not be overpowering.  They are so good!! Great for breakfast or on the go! TL;DR LOVE THEM
"This cocoa is a wonderful, rich tasting, not overly sweet, decadent product. Made with milk, it is delicious and one can adjust it to their liking with more or less cocoa and/or milk. That said, since it is already pre-mixed with sugar, this is an extremely expensive product. Green and Black recommends 4 teaspons per cup, which means this little canister will only make a few cups.<br /><br />I grew up in Britain and cannot drink Swiss Miss or Nestle cocoas as they have no cocoa flavor at all, and are ridiculously sweet. This is a wonderful product, but if buying Green and Black's cocoa, I prefer the straight cocoa powder with which I can mix my own sugar. I can then afford to have good cocoa (hot chocolate) without breaking my piggy bank ;) TL;DR True European Taste-Wonderful Cocoa, but Pricey"
This is a great tasting quality item. I love how it dispenses. It doesn't get messy like the others do without a pump. No pump needed for this one! TL;DR Great!
"These chips were formerly offered at Gelson's Market but are now only available online...at half the cost of retail stores :) :) :).  If you want to cut-back on unnecessary calories but still like to munch on tortilla chips then Guiltless Gourmet is for you !  They are baked and not fried in oil which more than doubles the calories.  I prefer the Mucho Nacho flavor but they also have Chili-Lime, Yellow Corn, Blue Corn, and other flavors. TL;DR Baked is Better for You !"
"My husband loves this rich, robust dark roast coffee. We agree it is much better than Starbucks and we love the pricing. It is not as strong or leaves a chicory aftertaste like Starbucks. I am a fan too, but prefer the medium roast. Either way you cannot lose. Santa brought us a Senseo coffee machine with the Dark and Medium Roast Pods.  Of course, Santa would chose the perfect strength for each of us! TL;DR Santa is a Smartie"
"Happy with this purchase, it's a good deal. It's the most fragrant coriander ever! Coriander is a super spice, tri-dosha (and a health supplement as well, research it, it's a ground cilantro seed). We use it in lots of dishes.<br />Thank you! TL;DR Great quality spice!"
"The outside of the box gives the impression that this is a ""natural"" and organic-type of product.  Sorry to report that this product contains genetically modified ingredients.  If you go to the website of this company and look at the second page of their FAQ's, you will see that they believe in bio-engineering.<br /><br />The name of this company is quite misleading.  There is nothing ""natural"" about using gmo foods, and a wolf in sheep's clothing is still a wolf.  For those people who think they are getting a ""natural"" gluten free product, I suggest you look at Mary's Gone Crackers or other truly organic products. TL;DR contains gmo's"
"""Due to availability some flavors may be substituted without prior notice"".<br />The flavor that I really wanted, were the flavors that were not available :/. Spicy Egg Nog, Gingerbread, Pumpkin Spice. TL;DR Ehh.."
My puppy has food allergies but this food does not effect him. It's all natural and he loves it just the way it is. TL;DR Puppy Loves It
This product was recommended by my dental hygienist. It looks and tastes just like cane sugar but has fewer calories and does not digest the same as sugar so is low glycemic. It also helps repel bacteria in the mouth. This product has been around in Europe for 100 years and why we don't use it more in the USA is a mystery. I'm diabetic and this product does not raise blood sugar. It's amazing to have something to replace sugar in my coffee!  Ask your dentist about this product. I also love that it's make of American hard wood which is a renewable resource. Do not by xylitol from China! TL;DR Love Xyla. It just like sugar!
"My whole family loves this ice tea drink. We go through a gallon a day. It is refreshing, sugar free, caffeine free and the cheapest drink next to water. What more could you want. It is easy to carry back home, my bad back loves that. It is easier to store in cabinets. We take the canisters with us when we travel, no threat of spilling. The canisters are better for the enviroment than plastic jugs or aluminum cans. Plus we use the empty canisters later for storing anything from nails, screws, threads, etc. Can keep things dry & sand free at the beach. Our extended family has grown fond of it also. It is not available in their area so they are ordering it by the case online. The only thing you need to do is clean out your pitcher routinely. A residue will build up on the inside of the pitcher over time. I love it mixed with cold water and chilled. My husband likes it a little stronger by mixing powder with hot water and chilling. It makes a difference. TL;DR BEST ICE TEA EVER"
Udi's bread products are delicious but do not buy them here! Get them at your local health food store for half the price and no shipping!!! TL;DR don't buy it here
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first tried the Izze Sparkling Apple drink, but I was pleasantly surprised. The drink is carbonated, but the carbonation is just right, not too strong or too weak. Although the 8.4 oz drink has 90 calories and 21g of sugar, it does contain 70% fruit juice, which in the case of the apple flavor is a combination of white grape, apple, and lemon juice concentrates.<br /><br />This is a refreshing drink, and a nice size if you want something less than a regular 12 oz can. There is very little after taste, if any at all, and the beverage provides a refreshing light feeling apple juice inspired experience. Also, Izze drinks are best served cold! TL;DR Great Sparkling Apple Soda Drink"
"This is the third espresso I've tried, and it's my hands-down favorite.  I will definitely buy more! TL;DR Awesome!"
"This green salsa is my all time favorite, and that's saying a lot considering how long I've eaten salsa, or tomatillo salsas. My favorite use for it is on top of eggs with a smidge of cheese (preferably mozzarella). Try it, you'll love it. It is worth looking for or buying online. TL;DR All time favorite"
"I love  the way these chiles taste on food. The roasted flavor is so good. The heat in the chili's make your nose run and your eyes water, but for some reason you just can't stop eating what you have created. These chiles make excellent salsa, BBQ chicken wing sauce. I even add the chiles to my different rubs for barbecuing. Just love them. TL;DR hot with a great taste"
"whoever invented this is BRILLIANT !<br />my 6 mo old lab is completely mesmerized by it.<br />the tug-a-jug combines all the things that interest a young energetic dog;<br />food, noise, food, mental challenge, something to chew on and food.<br />somehow it dispenses the treats at just the perfect rate to keep him interested but not allow him to over-eat.<br />outstanding product. TL;DR delighfully devious"
"Originally I was excited to receive this product...blooming tea to a tea drinking...who wouldn't be. But when i actually saw what i paid for i was surprised at the poor quality of the glass teapot, very chintzy, very small and the tea was bitter even after adding sugar. We did have a little fun watching the tea bloom, but it got a little creepy after a while as the leaves began acting like worms... another story. The best part of this product is the packaging! Sorry. TL;DR Terrible Tea"
The dog food arrived in a very timely manner.  My dogs seem to love it and it saves me a trip to the grocery store where they are refrequently out of stock. TL;DR Mighty Dog Select Menu Beef Tenderloin
"As a lover of strong coffee and a far-too-frequent Starbuks visitor, I was pleased to find a coffee of this quality for home use. The K-cups cannot be beat, and, for me, the taste is just amazing! If you like your coffee strong and dark, this is the k-cup for you. Better that Nantucket double diamond, on a par with many espresso's, but not too strong as a ""daily drink"". Also check out ""Black tiger"" from Coffee People - not quite as bold or bright, but good none-the-less. TL;DR Like Espresso/Strong Coffee - Look no further"
Both our cats love these treats.  One of our cats will sit at the cabinet and meow for them. Great product. TL;DR Greenie cat treats
"My husband came over from the UK about ten years ago. When he first arrived here in the states there were very few companies importing at least from a retail product standpoint many of the things he missed. If you have never had ""pickle"" with very nice cheese and artisan bread you can not even begin to image what you are missing. TL;DR A little bit of England in a jar"
"Deep, rich flavor.  Great price when you use the subscribe and save option considering it is organic and fair trade.  While the big bag is kind of clunky, I'm glad the company is willing to reduce waste by using larger packages.  It's easy enough for me to transfer to glass, ceramic or metal food storage bins. TL;DR good coffee, good price"
I'm using these with my 10-week old Siberian Husky and she'll do just about anything for me if I have one in my hand. TL;DR My dog loves these
"Disappointing. My Wife and I picked this up hoping to sample a variety of coffee with our new Keurig, and find the flavors we liked. Nearly half of my 34-count sampler consisted of 2 flavors - spiced egg nog, and pumpkin spice. To make matters worse, both taste very similar. Not exactly the flavors you are looking for in June, either.<br /><br />The only good thing to come out of this mess is that it introduced me to a single cup of wild blueberry which was delicious. I'll be sure to order a carton of just that in the future and stay away from the so-called ""sampler"" packs on amazon, which are obviously just a method for sellers to offload unpopular or outdated flavors. TL;DR Won't buy again"
"I really did not like these potatoes at all. I thought they tasted worse than most of the others I've tried. I have to admit that I am a fan of whole potatoes, but I like to keep a box of potato flakes on hand. My husband likes dried potatoes, but he did not like these. TL;DR dried potatoes"
"This is a really good cereal, though admittedly if you're used to Rice Krispies, it will not be the same.  My kids, all picky, like this cereal.  The recipe for peanut butter crispy treats on the box is awesome!  No one misses Rice Krispies in our house! TL;DR Very Good"
I am very disappointed in these K cups.  I made it using the smallest cup size and it still tastes like hot water.  I guess if I added cream and sugar it would taste like sweet creamy hot water.  I am mad that I bought the 50 pack and it is not returnable.  They are going in the trash. TL;DR FLAVORLESS
"Mildly chocolate, nice aftertaste.  Be sure to shake container well to loosen product.  If result is week, open container and add unused powder to your cup.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014K91GY"">Keurig 15540 Green Mountain Coffee - Hot Cocoa</a> TL;DR Keurig Green Mountain Cocoa"
"I ordered these in bulk for bday party goodie bags... I wasn't sure anyone would have tried them before, but I was having a pirate-themed party. ALL the kids LOVED it, and most had eaten before which was good. They were a big hit! TL;DR YUM!"
"This stuff is surprisingly good. A lightly carbonated fruit drink, it's got a tangy-sweet flavor that's really unique. The cans themselves are awfully small, but the taste is truly big. It's made from 100% juice with no added sugar, corn syrup, or artifical sweeteners, yet plenty sweet enough naturally for most people's taste I'd think. My 12-year-old son loves it too. A terrific, natural drink. Ingredients include apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, rasberry, and strawberry juice concentrates reconstitued with filtered, sparkling water. It's all natural though they have added vitamin C so that it provides 100% RDA. A most excellent drink I'll continue buying for a very long time. TL;DR Most excellent"
I love this quinoa. The best price. The flavor it's great. I prefered to purchase online since the price is right and better than any other store. TL;DR Great buy
"This tea is wonderful. I drink it every morning, and occasionally in the evenings as well. The strawberry essence is noticeable in aroma, but much more subtle in taste, and it pairs nicely with creamer. I would say they greatest shortcoming here is in Iced Tea. If you are an avid iced tea drinking you might with to try a different blend, as without the heat, the subtle strawberry flavor and scents tend to be nearly unnoticeable. It has a rich, dark, nearly red color possibly lent to it by the hibiscus, and it simply looks divine, but the flavor doesn't go well chilled. The price is astonishing given the quality of the leaves. But, do remember, it is a loose leaf tea, so you will need some kind of strainer or reusable tea bag (muslin works brilliantly) to make it. Do be careful not to oversteep. Anything beyond 5 minutes, and it does become noticeably bitter. TL;DR Absolutely amazing"
"I ordered the hickory smoked soy jerky, and was very impressed. It had some type of sauce on it that surprised me (don't know if this is typical of all flavors), but was delicious. I have in the last few months purchased the Vegan Dreams variety pack...a drier, thinner and chewier product, but not necessarily less tasty. The sauciness on my Primal hickory smoked might lend itself to heating it up for different vegan meals, as it is more juicy. I look forward to trying the other varieties.<br />I just tried the Texas Bar-b-que, and I really like this flavor as well. This version seems to be a bit less ""saucy"", but just as moist and delicious. It does have a ""stringy"" texture to it that makes dental floss a must! In the search for a good veggie jerky, I am leaning towards the Primal line. TL;DR Really good!"
"`No Fear, Super Energy' is a big claim when there are so many energy drinks out there.  For about less than three bucks a can, it competitive in price, but I have to be honest.  The taste was bad.  It was like a chemical peach flavor without much fizz.  I am sensitive to caffeine and Taurine, but really did not feel much of a boost.  If you like your vitamins, there is plenty of Vitamin C, B6 and B12.  The calorie intake is 260 a can!  I think I will stick to Red Bull or RockStar, even if they cost a little more. TL;DR Not Pricey; Foul Taste"
"The real texture and taste of ""fine"" licorice -- not like the junky sweet American stuff. Adored!! If you like black licorice and haven't had the opportunity to try the elite of the licorice world, then these are for you!! TL;DR Truly European Licorice!!"
"This Tassimo Maxwell coffee  from the Maxwell Cafe collection<br />is the choice at our house no matter who is choosing! Finally<br />a coffee that My husband, Kids & friends love! This price can't be Beat! TL;DR This Coffee is so smooth it's the choice at our house!"
I love KIND bars and the Almond & Coconut is my favorite flavor. I keep a box of these in my drawer at work. TL;DR Great taste. I love them.
"La Tienda has a huge catalog of wonderful food items from Spain.  These anchovies were the ""gateway drug"" to the other delicious discoveries.  Try their ""white anchovies"" and their Iberico ham.  YUM!  Quick service, well packaged, highest quality merchandise.  You will love it. TL;DR REAL anchovies"
"I like my coffee strong without tasting burnt. This stuff is exactly that. I use a french press and this stuff grinds wonderfully without having a lot of coffee dust. I was afraid when I took that first sip and was instantly blown away by the easy-on-the-tongue flavor. I'm not caffeine sensitive considering I take Excedrin every day, but I can definitely feel the jolt with this! TL;DR Wow"
"I bought saffron advertized on this page from ""GourmetFoodStore"" - its not good and we didn't like it.<br />When I bought it, they were selling it as ""AlTaj"" Crown brand saffron which is much better in quality IMO. What I got was ""Harvest of saffron"" - the one displayed on the page now.<br />I had to send many emails to get a reply, I filed a buyers claim but the seller kept delaying their response and finally amazon close the claim as time-out -- hello amazon , you should have checked with me first<br /><br />So my feedback in short<br /> - I didn't like this ""Harvest of Saffron. IMO Al-Taj and Gathering of Saffron are much better brands<br /> - I didn't like the seller. So check other's reivew and feedback about seller before buying. TL;DR show one thing - sell another"
"I am an adult, and I have been drinking this powdered goat milk for a year at the most. (love it) I only drink it when it's chilled or really cold, straight out of the freezer. (oh my) Delicious! I also use goat milk to make chocolate milk and with cereal. TL;DR MGM"
This popcorn doesn't pop well. If I add 2x to 3x the oil and a lot of extra popcorn to the pan I get a full pot. Even then it takes forever to start popping and leaves a bunch of burnt kernels. As soon as I use up this order I'm switching back to the organic brand from my local co-op. It costs a little more but that's made up for with everything actually popping. TL;DR Doesn't Pop Well
"This food contains meat and the vitamins and minerals your cat needs - no fruits, vegetables or grains. It's ideal for cats who need a limited ingredient diet but whose owners are not willing to prepare a home made diet. All canned food contains thickeners such as guar gum or carrageenan which can also be allergens. However dry food contains a high level of starch (from grain or potato) to make it bake like a cereal, and starch is completely unsuitable for cats.<br /><br />I feed my own cats a home made raw meat diet, but I have fostered cats and I fed them Evo 95% meat. The rabbit and the chicken seem to be favorites. TL;DR One of the best choices in commercial cat foods"
"I've drank No Fear since it's creation. I'm VERY sad to see it go, and have only recently noticed the distributors locally seize to carry it. It had great flavor, and a sufficient energy kick. It wasn't that bad for you compared to Monster products. It's sad to see it go. TL;DR Long time drinker."
"We just like the previous poster had gone to Pigeon Forge and did the wine sampling and LOVED the peach slushy drink mix! I tried the other one she made, i think it was a raspberry wine but im not sure which freezer she mixed it with. She did say that the raspberry one was the most popular but i didnt like as much course i am not a wine drinker. I found the peach to be a smooth peachy taste and it is sooooo good! Glad i can order more! TL;DR Am hooked!"
THEY ARE CANDY BARS.  SENT THEM THE VANCOUVER BC.  THEY WERE MUCH APPRECIATED SINCE THEY CANNOT GET THEM UP THERE. TL;DR WHAT CAN I SAY
"I keep these nuts in my desk at work so I have something tastey and nutritious to munch on.  The raisons are the fattest, juciest I've ever eaten!! TL;DR great snack!"
"Claey's Lemon Drops are hard to find. When I come upon them in a store, I grab a dozen or so if I can. I was very pleased to discover them on Amazon.com, and we've already ordered a few times -- sharing them with very pleased friends! They have a nice lemon flavor, with no weird after-taste.<br /><br />If you like lemon hard candy, give Claey's Lemon Drops a try, and you won't be disappointed. TL;DR High Quality Candy!"
"No wonder they were so cheap.  They don't work very well in my machine because of the ""biodegradable"" packaging.  I wouldn't buy them again. TL;DR Ethical Coffee Nespresso capsules"
"I heard about sour sop on the internet for being a great cancer fighter. Time will tell if the claim is true but I will say this, it tastes great. TL;DR Tastes great"
"As prepared, this instant noodle soup is more noodle than soup.  The three components (noodles, flavor powder, flavor oil) are packaged separately so you can adjust them to your taste.  Hot water, a couple of minutes in the microwave, and it's ready.  The lemongrass flavor is pronounced but not overpowering, the chili flavor is more muted.  Heat lovers will want to have some Sriracha, Mongolian fire oil or another Asian hot sauce handy.  The overall impression was rich and satisfying for a quick lunch or snack.  It would also serve as a good base to build on if you happen to have add-ins, such as fresh cilantro, sliced chilis or scallions, some sauteed cabbage or a leaf of Thai basil, to put it over the top.  You could also make it with beef or chicken broth. TL;DR Easy to prepare; good lemongrass flavor"
"These are very tasty cookies.  Originally I bought them because they are gentler on one's stomach.  After a few necessary surgeries last year I found that wheat products tended to make me feel bloated and uncomfortable if I ate too much of them.  Thus I tried to cut back on wheat.  Of course cookies are one of those things we feel guilty about anyhow.  Well I don't feel guilty eating these cookies!  They have no ingredients which cause an allergic reation such as refined sugars, dairly or wheat.  Also they are delicious.  My finace has been requesting them and he grew up on the all-american startch and potato diet!<br /><br />The reason for 4 stars:<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is that the packaging be improved.  By this I mean that each package has 2 servings but the serving is only half a cookie!  So one can gobble up too much at a time.  If they would make one-serving sizes that would be great.  It's easier to control calories, requires less mental calculation and is an honest way to report calories.  Also for children it's easier to say ""one"" cookie, then ""half"" a cookie.<br /><br />However I don't hold this too much against the company because this packaging is standard industry practise.  However I hope in future they will think about making a single-serving package or a same-size package that has 2 cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise they are fantastic for what they are meant to be...that is a cookie alternative for those of us with sensitive digestive systems, and perhaps a few loved ones with a sweet tooth. TL;DR Tasty cookie -- even fiance likes it.."
This is the best caffeinated gum I have tried.  It seems to work much more effectively than Jolt gum (maybe just larger pieces).<br /><br />I will keep ordering it. TL;DR Works and tastes great
"I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say ""That's hot!"".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales. TL;DR Hot and delicious"
"My baby likes the mac n cheese in the jars. So, when I couldn't find the jars at the store I was at, I tried these mac n cheeses thinking they were the same. They are not. She doesn't like these. Maybe it is a texture issue mainly as these are much runnier than the jar kind. Looking for more mac n cheese jars. TL;DR Nope"
"I used to be able to buy these at Sam's, and now Amazon is the only place I can find them.  They are the best dried raspberries I've ever tasted, not the dry ones I can occasionally find at the grocery store, and these are a much better price too.  I highly recommend this product.<br /><br />Carolyn in Clearwater TL;DR Delicious dried red raspberries"
I grew up eating these and introduced them to my very picky five year old.  She absolutely loves them.  We moved last year and I haven't been able to find them in a store - so when I found them on Amazon I was thrilled.  I ordered them about six weeks ago (12 cans) and already need to reorder.  She ate 6 franks the first day we received them.  She asks me for them almost every day. TL;DR Best thing ever!!!
A very delicious relish that compliments samoosas. Everyone loves it. I better not run out or I will be in trouble. TL;DR Perfect rellish for Samoosas
"If your child is anything like mine, he or she does not like vegetables and it's a constant struggle to get them to even try a bite. The Peter Rabbit Organics makes getting kids to eat their veggies a problem no more! With apple as the main ingredient and an applesauce consistency, my son will finally eat something I want him to. The pouches are convenient to pack and go. Great line of kid's food products. TL;DR My kid hates peas!"
"I am one of those people who believe there is no better pairing in the world than chocolate and peanut butter.  So for me, this is heaven in a jar.  Absolutely delicious!!! TL;DR Oh YUMMMM..."
"This is my cat's favorite wet food.  He really prefers most dry foods, but we feed him wet food for its moisture content.  He is on a low carbohydrate diet.  The Wellness pouches are his favorites. TL;DR Favorite wet food"
"High marks for taste & appearance.  Very good price on line compared to local stores. TL;DR Great Syrup, Good Buy"
Looks nice and works great.  I no longer have my K-Cups jamming up my cupboards and am able to see all the kinds that I have. TL;DR K-Cup Carousel
"woof, woof, woof... love the bully's.. make sure your delivery person doesn't leave them out where the dogs are, or they'll be gone before you get home! TL;DR bully for you!"
This popcorn is just like the popcorn you get at movie theaters but not with all the butter.  My family absolutely loves it! Highly recommend. TL;DR Great Popcorn!
"This is, by far, my favorite tea, and the only one I always drink without any flavorings.  When I found its ingredients promote lower blood pressure, I decided to restore it to my daily regimen.  Local stores, however, were either overpriced, or out of stock.  Amazon's product comes at a lower than local price, and, of course, with the Amazon rep for superior customer service.<br /><br />This last is a significant factor.  When a case of soup contained several cans that were severely dented, I contacted Amazon customer service, and in less than three days, they had delivered AN ENTIRE NEW CASE - FOR FREE.  When I read reviews denigrating Amazon's customer service, I laugh, certain that the person was not dealing with a full case.<br /><br />The only negative is that the maker, Celestial Seasonings, decided to jazz up a perfect product with peppermint.  The scent is aggravating.  It seems to be less noticeable with recent deliveries, and the positives far outweigh this glitch. TL;DR Lose the mint, keep the hibiscus"
"My most recent purchase through Amazon was not good.  It was Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Albacore Tuna, 5 Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)<br />The tuna has an odd somewhat metallic taste and smell.  I tried three of the cans and am concerned that they may have changed their source or methods.<br />I contacted the company but received no response. TL;DR No longer good - I used to love them."
"I have many food intolerances and this the first protein powder I have found that taste good,mixes up easily and most of all doesnt bother my digestive problems. TL;DR Great protein powder"
"I have these to give out to children at my office.  I used to buy other candies but the other office people ended up taking them and these fit nicely out of site in the drawer.  They look like huge versions of real money, too so kids really like them. TL;DR great gift for kids"
"I was so excited to be able to order these beans off of the internet because i just moved 1000 miles from NY. Unfortunately, the cost of shipping was pretty high, but it was so worth it! TL;DR thank you!"
This is some of the best green tea out there! I'll buy it again! The only thing about is that the stores around here don't carry it anymore!!! TL;DR It's real smooth
"Get some of this sauce.  Great on any mexican or spanish food.  Not recommended if you don't like spicy food! TL;DR My favorite habanero sauce, period."
At first I thought there was no taste to these which I could have lived with but the after taste was just plain awful. I ended up throwing these away along with the money I spent on them. TL;DR The taste was awful
"We have an outdoor feral cat that comes daily for meals. So, I guess, if she's out & about, she wouldn't be too choosy for a free meal. She takes shelter in an old Omaha Steaks styrofoam box when it's really freezing out. However, cats being cats, she can leave things lying there if she doesn't like it.<br /><br />But she really likes Friskies Canned Cat food & has for years.<br /><br />Got this pack of $24 for about $13.39, free shipping. Why waste gas<br />& time going to a store?  Good deal-especially when on sale!  Kitty will thank you. TL;DR Agree, Kitty loves this salmon & beef. No finnicky eater here!"
I have five cats so getting all of them to like a food can be difficult. I give them wetfood as a weekly treat and this is the only type they all love and devour! They all love the gravy and two in particular mostly just lick the gravy so this is more food for my buck! TL;DR excellent choice
"I use this when I run out of milk for my coffee and tea, as well as adding to gravy or some baked goods. It dissolves rapidly and doesn't make lumps (Organic Valley nonfat PM requires whipping or shaking vigorously). I like that it is made in Holland as I think the EU has healthier rules regarding animal husbandry and resultant quality. Also this is the ONLY full cream powdered product brand I have found. Yes, it's a bit pricey and yes I wish it were organic, but for my needs this is the best one out there. I'll be glad when Amazon carries the larger more cost effective cans. TL;DR Healthy instant coffee & tea creamer."
"Firstly, the taste of this product is outstanding.  I was refreshed and did not feel like I needed much in the way of a beverage later in my work day.  The bottle I got as a sample had gel from the aloe, not sure if that is the way it should be, however, it was okay and did not upset my system or anything. I did try in the last part of the bottle to mix it with some sparkling water, it changed the taste to a more sour/tart flavor, that was so much less refreshing.<br /><br />I would like to try this over ice as well some time.  The taste is really outstanding, and it did give me nice boost of energy with a little calming effected for added enjoyment.<br /><br />Enjoy. TL;DR Great Taste Cold Had Gel Bits Though"
A really delicious and satisfying product with just the right sweetness for immediate cravings. Buy 'em in bulk so you won't run out of them too quickly... they're all gone before you know it! TL;DR Fiber Plus Gets an A Plus
"The tree came excatly as pictured,packed well, soil were still a bit moist,even temperature outside was hot and tree drove all day on the ups truck,I think it survived the transportation.I put it outside in the evening,gave planty water,sprayed for bugs, it looks even fresher in the morning with other siblings bonsais.Now need to go and get recomended humidity tray.It was very nice to find instruction in the box as well. In overall very pleased. TL;DR Cute tree"
"This is indeed the best and most tasty bar on the market. Delicious, crunchy, and I can't live without it.<br />I have at least one per day and on weight watchers it is only 2pts. Definitely try. TL;DR Special K Bars Extrodinaire"
"For those seeking sugar-free products without all of the chemical sweeteners like aspartame, this sugar-free Roasted Pecan Syrup from Blackberry Patch is a natural solution. A rich pecan flavor with hints of vanilla, this syrup is sweet without being cloying. The thick, slow pouring syrup offers a nice mouthfeel similar to that of ""regular"" pancake syrup, a nice switch from the watery, too-thin textures of some sugar-free products.<br /><br />A special bonus is the natural flavoring--no off tastes, no strange chemicals!<br /><br />It's important to note that the sweetener here is maltitol, a ""sugar alcohol"" that can, for some, create gastrointestinal discomfort in large amounts (20-30 grams/day). I don't have this experience (perhaps because I don't consume such large amounts), and I appreciate that maltitol is not carcinogenic... A little online research from credible sources may be useful if you're concerned about this issue.<br /><br />Blackberry Patch makes a number of delicious naturally-flavored sugar-free syrups; experiment and find your own favorite! TL;DR Sugar free AND naturally-flavored? Naturally!"
"I've used a lot of different protein powders and decided to try this one for a change.  I was not put off by the slightly odd color or the slight grit of this powder as neither were too bad in my opinion.  The taste is not too bad either - not great but okay.  What I was put off by, unfortunately, is the fact that it seems to make me feel nauseated even in small quantities.  Very disappointing, and I can't return the large amount that is left. TL;DR Upsets my stomach badly"
"We got this syrup to use with coffee as well as to make Italian sodas, with and without the cream. My first use was with coffee;the aftertaste was horrible. The bitter taste flooded your mouth and was not washed away by subsequent sips of coffee;that cup went down the drain! Unfortunately we fared no better with the sodas; the bitter aftertaste was persistent. Needless to say, our subscribe and save shipments on this product have been cancelled. TL;DR bitter aftertaste"
"At a time when 1/4 lb of this type of tea from some ""gourmet"" shops will cost you just about as much as this 2 lb bag, this is a real bargain. It's not the most flavorful smoked tea I've ever had, but it's way more than acceptable. I'm now on my second 2 lb bag. Good stuff! TL;DR Lapsang Souchong tea"
Great tea and darling tin can it comes in. The tea is smooth and does not have a strange aftertaste like those other cheaper brands. Pleased with it although it's a little pricey. TL;DR Yummy Tea
"Hope loves these treats, she will not eat anything else. We tried all others kinds she knows what she wants. THANKS!!!! TL;DR Best treats"
"There are several types of hams varying in quality.<br />Ham and water product is the lowest, followed by ham with water added, ham in natural juices and then the top of the line HAM.<br />North Country makes awesome hams. We've purchased them many times and the flavor is great. Nicely trimmed and no added juices or water. So you are only paying for a ham. If you want a great ham at a fair price, try them. TL;DR Most Excellent Ham"
"I've been using this cup/filter combo everyday for 2 months or so.  The cup is nicely constructed and I have no problems with it.<br /><br />However, the filter does not perform very well if you use tea leaves that are very small.  I drink PG Tips loose leaf everyday, 3 times a day.  The leaves are fine and the holes at the bottom of the filter allow the tiniest tea particles to fall through.  If this doesn't bother you, the system works.  If you don't like tea particles at the bottom of your clear cup, it will begin to annoy you.  I bought this system thinking that the few flakes at the bottom of the cup would not bother me but i have resorted to using the filter in another cup and pouring the leaf-free liquid into my drinking cup because there are many unfiltered leaves at the bottom of the cup.  Imagine the entire bottom of the cup covered in the tiniest leaf particles...<br /><br />Also, the filter stains easily.  After two months, there is a hint of yellow orange stain on the side filters.<br /><br />Therefore, if you use larger tea leaves, this system may work decently for you.  If you drink tea like the loose leaf PG Tips that have fine leaves, I would look for an alternative.  Hope this review helps people thinking about drinking PG Tips with this system. TL;DR Small tea flakes will fall through"
I enjoy a pumpkin flavor with my coffee. Before I had to wait till September or the holidays to get that type of coffee. TL;DR Pumpkin Syrup
"These are just glorified rawhide chews.Both dogs turned up their noses,my little one chewed for about 2 minutes and just ignores it.I generally like their products,rinse,tooth paste etc but I won't buy these again.I thought they were like checkups and greenies but they aren't.If your dog likes rawhide then you'll be ok if not you have wasted your money. TL;DR Not liked by either dog"
DELICIOUS! A RAAWY! AS I COOK THAI SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK I BUY THESE REGULARLY.  THEY ARE ALWAYS FRESH AND OF GOOD QUALITY.  EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH IT.  IMPORT FOOD.COM ALWAYS PROVIDE AN EXCELLENT SERVICE TL;DR YUMMY!!
"So Sprinkle Spangles were easily my favorite cereal growing up. However, they were sadly discontinued in 1995 and never brought back. Though this cereal is not quite the same, it is also made by General Mills, and tastes as close as you're going to get. Basically Sprinkles Cookie Crisp is to Sprinkle Spangles as to what Vault is to Surge. So enjoy this wonderful cereal! TL;DR Tastes Like Sprinkle Spangles!"
"These cookies are soft and delicious.  They are good for a quick, healthy snack or a quick breakfast.  This cookie lover highly recommends. TL;DR Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal, Raisins are Yummy"
"I have loved gooseberries ever since I had my first piece of gooseberry pie at a small family bakery in San Luis Obispo county. I've always preferred the more tart fruits in desserts, preserves, chutneys and such.<br /><br />I find them a refreshing change from the sweeter desserts, etc. I was thrilled to find them available from Amazon and at such a good price.<br /><br />Amazon ------- not just for books anymore!!!!!!!!!!! TL;DR Crazy for Gooseberries"
"I love yummy earth's candy, especially their chili pops (which have amazing bite), so I figured I would give these a try since I LOVE ginger.<br /><br />I was hoping for a spicy, zesty (like the package says) ginger flavor. Unfortunately, the ginger is not the star of this candy. It's good, just not gingery. I think people who say they don't like ginger would like these, which I think is what yummy earth was going for- since ginger is such an acquired taste.<br /><br />I think they played it way too safe. I will probably buy from the ginger people next time, their candy is very gingery.<br /><br />I still love yummy earth's chili pops and wild peppermint drops! TL;DR Not the ginger candy I was hoping for"
"We have the fancy coffee maker with many of the little cups, which are nice for a quick cup of coffee, but I have this Community Dark Roast on auto-ship not only to gain the price break, but to make sure that I do not run out of this staple in my pantry. This coffee is full-bodied, but not so dark and strong. For a dark roast coffee, it tastes more medium to my palette. Give it a try...you will not be disappointed.... TL;DR Favorite, Go To Coffee..."
"I use this on Mexican dishes, rice, beans, etc.  I am a huge fan of Habanero sauces and this green sauce takes the cake.  I haven't found anything similar in quality or spiciness.  Highly recommend if it if you enjoy a nice hot green sauce. TL;DR Beast of a Habanero Sauce - Amazing!"
"I sent the Christmas candy to my sister and she said it was delivered promptly, was very good, and she really liked the candy.  Thank you  Karen TL;DR candy"
Excellent product one which I would purchase again.  Better than purchasing smaller boxes from the grocery store. TL;DR Dogbiscuits
"I use this on a lot of foods - it has a hint of hotness in large amounts, but nothing overpowering.  My favorite use right now is to top off chicken breasts prior to grilling - amazing how great they taste, and my friends have had nothing but good things to say about it. TL;DR Tasty"
"I tired many different dog foods over the 3 yrs I have my cocker spaniel. I then came upon this breed specific dog food & figured I'd try it. My dog loves this food and always finishes his food. I've used this for over 1 yr now & he has not tired of it. I have seen a significant change (for the better) in him, he's more active and doing well.<br /><br />I only buy this brand food for him now.<br /><br />Buster gives it 2 paws up & I give it 5 stars. TL;DR Buster Loves this dog food"
"This bar taste great. It came in a cardboard box. And despite it being 90 degrees outside it was not melted. Shocking! I know. I had completely thought that would be a problem, but not at all. Wasnt even broken. Very satisfied with my entire order. TL;DR yummo"
"We are huge CL drinkers and love how this tastes but it stains EVERYTHING - fingers, pitchers, counters. If you can be very careful and/or don't mind red everywhere definitely try this out - its great and fruity without being too sweet or to 'fake' tasting. For us though, the staining was just too annoying so we're sticking with the other flavors (Lemonade, Mango Peach etc) TL;DR Great taste, not too sweet - but stains everything!"
"After reading all the other reviews I have to say mine did not measure up to their comments.  Was definately not packed the way others described, dirt all over the place and the pitchers all tangled up.  I think it will survive though so don't regret the purchase. TL;DR Disappointed"
"I read most of the reviews (especially the negative ones) about this product before purchasing and knew of the possibility that this particular model may not fit the brand of natural PB my wife likes (16 oz Natural Organic PB from Trader Joe's in a plastic jar).  I decided to get it because there was a decent chance it would fit.  Without opening the package, I could tell it wouldn't fit.  This could have easily been avoided if the specs were included in the product details.<br /><br />Anyone purchasing this or similar models should know that there are 6 DIFFERENT MODELS TO CHOOSE FROM:<br /><br />#100 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 77mm lid<br />#200 -- twist knob mixer for 16 oz reduced fat jar with 77mm lid<br />#300 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 70mm lid<br />#400 -- crank mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid<br />#500 -- twist knob mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid<br />#600 -- twist knob mixer for 36 oz jar with 99mm lid<br /><br />The product considered in this review refers to Model #100.  Those of you who want it to fit on the Trader Joe's PB that I mentioned earlier will need to get Model #300.<br /><br />As I said in the subject, this product looks like a great idea, but the marketing lacks an important fact (which I find unnecessarily deceptive) so I am giving it a sub-par rating.  It does NOT take much effort to list these very important specs that would help people buy precisely what they need, especially when this info is contained on the back of the product itself.<br /><br />I found the #300 model on another site and am purchasing it separately.  I'm also returning the one I got here.<br /><br />If you're going to get this product, pull out a ruler or measuring tape and measure your lid to ensure you get the right fitting model.  Thanks for reading. TL;DR Great Idea, BAD Marketing"
This cookie tastes great.  I only gave it a 4 because it is a little dry. TL;DR Great ginger flavor
"Finally, I found an online coffee that'll match or beat S.B. or Peet or Seattle B.<br />I'm a ""House Coffee"" guy and use 190 filtered water poured over grind in a paper cone, WOW!<br />PLEASE KEEP this stuff as good as it is now, thanks. TL;DR Very Very Good"
"GREAT chipotle. No wimpy, half-hearted heat here. Plus flavor. Must be because these folks' products are fresh and haven't been sitting in supermarket warehouses for months on end. Have a care, though, if you're used to measuring your ingredients using the usual commercial stuff, 'cause this powder is potent! TL;DR gringos beware"
"My girls, a Shih Tzu and a Pug, absolutely love the tracheas.  I have purchased the Bravo product ever since they were pups.....will be three (3) this year.  They are totally satisfied in chewing this product and have never chewed anything else like furniture, etc......so this must be meeting their needs. TL;DR Bravo Tracheas"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6625I"">Oregon Fruit Pitted Red Tart Cherries in Water, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)</a><br />Red Tart Cherries are hard to find in the grocery store, so I was thrilled when I saw them for sale on Amazon. I ordered 2 packages. But, I received 1 package of Red Tart Cherries and, like another reviewer, the second package was a package of Gooseberries. Plus, each and every can of the Cherries was dented badly. So I could not use anything from this order. I must say that Amazon was wonderful with this issue and gave me a refund with no hassle. This is my first problem with an order from Amazon after many years of service. So for that I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 star. TL;DR How can one confuse Gooseberries for Red Tart Cherries?"
I grew up in an outpost of the (former) British Empire in a family of tea lovers.  This is my favorite tea in the world.  Sounds weird to say that but it's true... TL;DR The best tea!
"This fondant is very easy to work with.  It rolls out quite easily.  We also found the color to be a very brilliant red, which we found very difficult to create on our own.  It also tastes quite good.  It is a product I would purchase again. TL;DR Will use it again"
"I have small dogs (Maltese) and these cookies are just the right size for tiny mouths.  I love that they are made in AMERICA and from quality ingredients. No worries about finding out that there is some terrible ingredient in them that will make my dogs sick or be fatal like some of the treats that come from CHINA.  I have these on the monthly subscription plan, which is also great, because it saves some money. Many paws up for Itty Bitty Buddy Biscuits!! TL;DR My dogs love these cookies!"
"If you like Kona coffee, I would recommend Tully's.  It's a bold but also milder coffee, so it has a rich flavor but isn't bitter.  Would recommend. TL;DR Tully's Kona Blend Kcups"
"The product was fine, but when the company shipped the product they did not put any message on the packaging that would have assisted in protecting the product - consequently the FedEx driver left the box directly in the hot sun and melted the product.  There would be no way for the driver to have known there was a risk. TL;DR The product was fine - the shipping was not"
My good friends told me about this product after they put there 3 dogs on it.  They were not kidding about how it makes the dog healthier and the coat better.  I switch back and forth between this and the All Meat Grain Canidae product.  All 3 of my dogs coat's activity level has increased.  They don;t eat as much and they stay regular with their bathroom movements. TL;DR Glad I bought this.
Leaves me full for several hours. We love this stuff. We don't love the sugar in it. Wish they'd sweeten it with stevia. TL;DR Chocolate sugary goodness.
by just tasting the finished product.  I have been enjoying all of the recipes at the company's website... baked the bread... and.... am scarfing down the lemon poppy waffles even as I type!  I added just a splash of organic lemon extract and made some lemon butter to go with it.  Very yummy! TL;DR You would never believe this is gluten free
"This yacon is very nutritious and has a sweet, resiny flavor that goes great with tea or smoothies. Yacon is a close relative of the sunflower and Jerusalem artichoke, but tastes kind of like a dried apple with perhaps a hint of sweet potato.<br /><br />The plant itself is a tuber that is composed mostly of water and fructo-oligosaccharides, which are prebiotics that increase the amount of beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract and have also been shown to increase calcium absorption. Yacon is great for diabetics because although it tastes sweet the type of sugar can't be absorbed by humans, but since it feeds the friendly bacteria in the digestive system it boosts the immune system and helps digestion. Yacon is also known for it's high antioxidant activity, and has been used as both a food and medicine by Indigenous Andeans for at least 3200 years. TL;DR Apple of the Earth"
I originally bought these to help get my husband's cholesterol down.  This is another method to get in oatmeal without having to make a hot cereal.  I even pack them as a quick breakfast on the go.  The Chocolate Brownie and Cranberry are our favorite varieties. TL;DR Great Tasting
These crackers have no flavor what so ever and for 100 calories you get the same amount as the Nabisco 100 calorie cookies. Save your money and buy 100 calorie snacks from your local supermarket. TL;DR Don't waste your money
"I'm a huge tiramisu fan so I got this, but I was very disappointed because this tasted nothing like tiramisu. The cream is vaguely similar if you try really hard to match the two, but there is absolutely no coffee flavor, which to me is the crux of tiramisu. So yeah, it's still tasty, the wafer texture is great, but don't get your hopes up if you're hoping for tiramisu. TL;DR Doesn't taste like tiramisu"
While I like the idea of Milo's Kitchen I found that the ingredients in the product raise some questions about the health risks to my Rottie.  There are onions and such that could cause harm to my pet so with that said I don't believe I will be purchasing this item again. TL;DR Milo's Kitchen Beef Sausage Slices with Rice
"What a worry-wart, the reviewer concerned about the plastic bottles.  The product is in plastic so it can be squeezed onto foods.  Seriously - now we've got to worry about any food packaged in plastic in addition to everything else?  OK, rant over.  If you can overlook the horrors of the packaging *shudder*, then prepare yourself to delight in a wonderful, versatile, VERY shelf stable and delicious product.<br />Does it have the complexity of very old, aged, syrupy balsamic that costs well over $100/bottle?  Not quite, but for 10 bucks a bottle, it's a hell of a deal and sure to impress any guest.  I LOVE it drizzled over my homemade pizza, especially on top of prosciutto, figs, carmelised onions, etc.  I put it on after cooking.  It's ok for dipping, but personally I find it a little thick for this.  Salads, YAY!  bruschetta, YAY!  Sandwiches?  YAY!!!  Excellent product.  Snap it up - the second bottle should keep nicely at least a year.  I first found it at a Seattle specialist food importer and they told me that people get addicted to it and keep coming back looking for it.  The price here on Amazon is comparable. TL;DR Fantastic on pizza, etc!"
"Words escape me when I bite into one of these scrumptious chocolates.  First of all, they are large - easily 2 bites worth.  Secondly, well, they are toooooooo yummy for words.  We all have our favorites but I guess you'll have to try them all and pick your own favorite choices - that is, if you can. TL;DR Heavenly"
"I believe the concept and the intended combination of ingredients is nutritious and may be delicious BUT not in this little package.  My 11 month old daughter took one bite and literally spit it out.  I tasted it and it was so lacking flavor.  I'll be making this combination for her on my own in our Beaba BabyCook.  The other fruit and veggie combinations are great, but this offering missed the mark completely. TL;DR I'd rather make this combination myself"
Perfect little crackers for little fingers on the go!  Plus the taste is great! TL;DR Great for on the go!
"I'm very disappointed in this product.  It has almost no taste, regardless of how much you put in.  I guess I will stick to cheaper brands as I'm not sure how they justify the $16 for this. TL;DR Almost no taste"
"Just because the item's description is 360t bucket doesn't guarantee a bucket anymore!  You'll receive 360 pieces of dubble bubble in a shipping box.  So if you where hoping to store them in the bucket, buy something else. TL;DR Bucketless!"
I have been drinking Ahmad teas for quite some time now and love all the flavors...so good! TL;DR Great tea
"We've been purchasing this elsewhere for a few years, but this was an irresistible deal.  We just love this very rich ""expresso"" flavor.  Great for coffee lovers!  Individual wrap is a plus, too. TL;DR Good rich flavor"
"We have tried many of the decaf k cups.  Being a Starbuck fanatic, I love stong coffee. I like to think I know good coffee and this is by far the best in flavor and strength.  I disagree with the comments of a bitter taste. This coffee rocks!! TL;DR The Best of the Decaf K Cups!"
"I have been feeding both of my dogs, one German Shep. and one Golden Retr. this dog food from the beginning.  I mix it with their can twice a day, 1/2 c dry 1/2 can.  So far it has helped keep their weight down and they dont get bloated, a thing you have to worry about with these deep chested dogs. I would never recommend feeding straight dry to any dog for any reason as I lost a dog to bloat due to my own ignorance.... would have been nice if my vet would have told me BEFORE he died!!!!<br />This product is exccellent and reasonably priced for my budget.  Im especially impressed it has no corn soy or wheat. TL;DR best dry so far!!"
"I ordered the item nearly 2 weeks ago and nothing came, no shipment notice, not even a notice that it was going to ship late. I had to buy an emergency bag of a different brand elsewhere and then go to other sources to buy the usual food. TL;DR Item did not ship"
My husband can only have decaf coffee so this has worked out perfect and he loves it. I will continue to order via ready brew.......... TL;DR starbucks via ready brew decaf
Insta-Bake is a wonderful product! It's a quick and healthy way to make pancakes and waffles in the morning. TL;DR Healthy customer
Excellent product.  I mix it with apple juice for a great morning pick me up and when I dont have time to eat a complete breakfast.  Great way to get off the coffee habit.  I noticed an additional energy boost from my first use.  Taste is good and no problem with excess sediment because I use a shaker type cup with lid.  When drink is done I put a little water in the cup to get every golden bit. I noticed the enzymes have helped with a little digestive issue I have.  Easy way to keep balanced fruit and vegetable nutrition in my diet. TL;DR As great as described - Amazing!
"I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day. TL;DR A must have if you have painful heavy periods"
"My only quibble with this product is a poor nutiritional label that is unclear about the carb count.  When you're doing a low carb diet, you can't risk not understanding the nutritional information on the package.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, these are good.  It's a really good low carb snack. TL;DR Nice product for low carb snacking"
"When I bought this tripe... I expected the package to look exactly like the picture. Instead, I had a smaller bag of tripe that was not quite the same. Regardless, my dog loves it. Just not quite what I expected... TL;DR not what I expected..."
I have a 120lb. Rottie and he was so ecited when this bone came to him in the mail!!! It was a great size for him and he loved it! TL;DR Great for BIG dogs!
"I am glad to get this on Amazon, now that my Safeway store no longer stocks it. TL;DR malted milk"
"Simply the best!<br /> Nutty taste that separates Steel cut from the rest. Try it once - TL;DR McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal, Traditional"
"I got these when my youngest was a baby.  She loved them then and she loves them now as a toddler.  My preschooler really likes them too.  They're great snacks, because they're not messy, and they're not too filling so they're OK as a 'close to dinner time"" snack.  I also like that they're not artificially flavored or sugary.  They're easy to carry around in the car or the diaper bag too. TL;DR Babies, toddlers and preschoolers love these"
"I have a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs around 10 lbs at the most. I have mostly fed her Mighty Dog in the can. She recently had to have almost all of her teeth extracted except for 2. She had a hard time eating the Mighty Dog because it is all chunked together like Spam. Even when I mashed it up, she had trouble eating it and scraping it out of her bowl.<br /><br />I started feeding her Pedigree Senior in the pouches. She likes it and where it had a little gravy in it it made it easier for her to eat. For the most part, it slides right out of the pouch although sometimes some of the food gets stuck in the little pocket at the bottom.<br /><br />One pouch a day is plenty for her. She loves it. We tried the new beef flavor with gravy and she actually likes it more than the Lamb and Rice but the beef flavor gives her diarhea really badly. She has never gotten diarhea from any other dog food so after I feed her the case I am switching back to this variety.<br /><br />This fills her up, is easy to eat, is quick and convenient for me to give her, and it seems to be really easy on her stomach.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for any small dogs. Grade A from me. TL;DR Great for small dogs--one pouch a day"
"I have to admit that I barely gave Fancy Feast a second glance until those<br />wonderful commercials where the man proposes by presenting her with a white kitten<br />with the tag that said ""Marry Us"".  I still melt on that one!<br /><br />So, we started buying some Fancy Feast just to support a company who did such a<br />thoughtful, wonderful commercial! {Really - do we need any more commercials with cats<br />dancing around imaginary poultry?!)<br /><br />Our cats are gravy freaks, so I thought this would be a really good fit for them.<br />First off, there are THREE flavors in the box - chicken feast, beef feast and turkey feast.<br /><br />Neither cat cared for the beef much - they lick the gravy off of it, and leave the food<br />to turn to hard dry bits in their dishes. The like the chicken and turkey okay, but still<br />not their favorite food.<br /><br />Here is my problem with this product:<br />Fancy Feast already costs quite a bit per ounce, but we buy it from time to time both to spoil<br />our kitties and to show our monetary support of the company solely from that commercial. (Yep,<br />they found my soft spot!) We normally feed our cats wet once a day and dry any time else they are<br />hungry. Be prepared to have hungry kitties with this food, because they have replaced some of the actual<br />solid food with a volume of water/gravy to fill the can. We've found that they are actually not getting<br />nearly as much food as they used to, because of the decreased volume of solid food. So, both kitties end up<br />rubbing on the box the cans are in, asking for more long before we'd expect it. They just aren't getting full.<br /><br />The gravy is always a hit, but you can make ANY brand of wet food into a 'gravy feast' most of the time.<br />Just run hot water over the can before opening to loosen up the food, scoop a spoonful or two into their dishes,<br />then add a little bit of hot water to the can after you spoon out the food, and stir up all the bits from the edges<br />of the can to make a little more gravy. This works with packets too - scoop the food, add a little very hot water,<br />stir or shake them, then pour over the food. (There is actually a lot of potential gravy in our pets' food!)<br /><br />All in all, it was my first and last time to buy the Gravy Lover's Fancy Feast.<br />There is not enough actual food in the cans, too much water content, and we ended up going through<br />the food much faster. The other brands of Fancy Feast don't seem to create this problem, so it's just<br />the decreased amount of actual solid food in this version of cans.<br /><br />If you have a cat that loves only gravy, or is a VERY light eater, these might be just right.<br />For us, it just won't work.<br /><br />One note on Fancy Feast in general - it's mostly promotion, but the cats do like it, so we still buy it.<br />You have to watch the TEXTURES carefully when buying it - the flavors don't vary all that much, but<br />they offer pat&eacute;, sliced, bits, etc. If your cat is picky about texture, you do need to read carefully to<br />see what you are getting. TL;DR Well, get ready for hungry kitties!"
"If you like a good strong cup of coffee,you will love this one .It will get you going. TL;DR timothy's rainforest extra bold"
"The ""Healthy Indulgence"" pouches of cat food are prepared with FLUORIDATED water! A number of studies have now shown that fluoridated water increases the risk of osteosarcoma or bone cancer in humans and animals. Alone from my own circle of friends, two have lost their pets to bone cancer, most likely as a result of the animals' having consumed fluoridated water! BUYER BEWARE! TL;DR Caution!"
I love amazon.. I was stoked to know that I could purchase my favorite flavor of LifeSavers on one site... I will continue to shop this site for other things... TL;DR I love Amazon
"I'm still not a food reviewer. The problem is that I can't turn down free coffee. That said, this is good stuff, mellow with none of the bitter edge common with a lot of the cheaper stuff sold at the local grocery store. I subtracted one star from the review because of the ridiculously pretentious ad copy on the box. Drinking this coffee won't fix the world or make your life more fulfilling, I'm fairly sure. TL;DR Tasty"
"Samson, our Yorkie, would fight a rhinoceros for one of these jerky treats.  He knows exactly when he's supposed to get one (morning and evening) and does the doggie dance of joy when treat time arrives.  Happily, he's a small guy who doesn't need an entire jerky strip at one time, so the bag lasts a good while. TL;DR Excellent treat"
"So I got this DARK chocolate (I said DARK, right?) option because it is supposed to be DARK (i.e. not overly sweet).  Unfortunately, they used excessive amounts of artificial sweetener and this stuff is actually more sweet than regular hot chocolate - but in that syrupy, medicine type of way.<br /><br />Now I live on Splenda and thus I have no aversion to artificial sweeteners in general but this one is over the top.  That said, it you blend one of these with a bold coffee then you actually get a fairly good mocha - just do not add any sugar/sweetener ahead of time! TL;DR Artificially Sweetened"
Convenient meal in a box.  Makes cooking easy by having all the ingredients needed. TL;DR Food review
My dog loves these and they are good for her; all natural and low fat. TL;DR Good treat
"Being a water-hater all my life, the invention of MIO was a dream come true for me. After several bottles of experimentation with the other MIO flavors, I've found 3 squirts in a liter of water is perfect. I thought at first the Peach Tea would be one of my favorites. After several glasses of this, it's good, but not a favorite of mine like the berry/pomegranate, it reminds of a cheap peach wine from the 80's. TL;DR Good - but not my favorite flavor"
"I love this tea - lovely flavor, not bitter or bland. And the company's great too - they work with fair trade growers.  I recommend giving it a try. TL;DR the best green tea I've found"
"I have Celiac Disease and it is hard to keep my body healthy.  Because of the limit in diet, I always feel like I'm missing something and I'm usually at about 95%.  I never have gotten back to the 100% I was at before my Celiac.  I'm hoping that this will supply the missing pieces since it appears to have everything in it.  The fact that it is Gluten Free is a bonus!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first shake I made.  I mix various fresh fruits and juices with it in a blender but you can still taste the earthy freshness that the powder adds.  If you're looking for something that tastes like Kool-aid or Gator-aid this is not for you, but if you understand what Health Foods taste like, this should be right up your alley. TL;DR So Far So Good"
"This is not your run of the mill BBQ sauce, it is delicious. Has the right balance of sweet and spicy. Is also available in a thicker style, as well as a Yaki (Teriyaki). TL;DR All natural ingredients, homemade taste!"
"I was fortunate to run across these great people and company when they launched their Kickstarter campaign.  I watched the process of them growing and now placing product on Amazon.  Crowdsourcing can be magical!  My family loves the Vermont Maple Syrup and Salt the best, however, the Lemon and Sea Salt is my favorite!  Good for you.  No Con Agra crap.  Just popcorn, oil, and seasoning.  I would love to see a spicy version (buffalo, cajun, etc.  Keep up the good work. TL;DR My son is named Quinn which is why I tried this popcorn.  Now I tell him I named him after the popcorn!"
"i'm virtually never enthusiastic enough about a product to seek out where to post a review about it, but i LOVE these! i really don't like gumdrops or gummy bears/worms/whatever, so i was a little skeptical. but having all-natural products, no artificial flavors, sweeteners, or other additives is really important to me--i'm not a hippie, just someone who feels better when i steer clear of those things and knows that some, for instance, trigger some health problems. so i bought a bottle of these and am WOWed. they are super tasty, smooth and not overly gummy, no fake aftertaste, just yummy citrusy not-too-sweet flavor. these are my new multivites of choice, and i'm now going to seek out other products by nordic naturals. TL;DR yummy + natural! love these!"
"this dog food is a high quality product unlike other dog foods in the big box stores,i wanted a great dog food product that didnt stretch the budget, orijen first choice but hard to get in my locale and very costly,totw fit the bill and i can buy it from tsc for cheaper than any online deal you can find and i live in fourth largest city in the u.s. TL;DR a great dog food"
"I don't do as many junk foods now.<br />I know I shouldn't give a lot of stars, then they wont be available like some other items I want now, I keep seeing ""Currently unavailable. We don't know when or if this item will be back in stock""<br />I use these for something crispy with the almond butter I do now. Can't do dairy or peanuts now :(<br />They would be wonderful with cheese! Other topping you can think of! They have a Salted version which is good too!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4ET58"">Edward & Sons Brown Rice Snaps, Assorted Original, 3.5-Ounce Packs (Pack of 12)</a> TL;DR Great snack cracker, crispy!!!"
Great flavor but it is weak.  Enjoy it as an afternoon treat or when I am in the mood for something different. Not acidic either TL;DR Good flavor
"I actually thought I would get more beans with that weight, but that's ok. I haven't tried them in any recipe yet, so I can't really talk about the flavor. Just feel a little bit disappointed because of the amount of beans I got. TL;DR Kinda disappointed"
I do not recommend these for people.  My dog seemed to enjoy them.  They were too big for my cat. TL;DR Greenies
This is absolutely wonderful. It's the perfect mix of chocolate and spice. Amazon offers this at a great price - thanks so much for making this treat affordable! TL;DR Delicious!
"I got a recipie for Garbonzo Bean Soup from the TV-Cat Cora show.  It is Chicken Broth (4 cans), Garbonzo Beacn (2 cans), one half chopped and sauted onion, one crushed clove of garlic, some rosemary, and a bay leaf.  The other ingrediant was a chopped canned or bottled red roasted pepper (approx. 12 oz).  I use a 12 oz jar of Zergut Mild Ajvar (has peppers and eggplant) and it was out of this world! Not too spicy and my totally American Family loves it.  I also add some macaroni for a hearty meal.  Ralphs in Orange County, CA was carrying this product, but I can't find it any longer.  I will search Trader Joes and Middle Eastern stores, but if you find it - try it!  Not sure if I would like it as a cold spread or dip, but in the soup, it is an easy, fast, and impressive soup or meal!!!  Yummy!!!! TL;DR Try in a garbonzo bean soup! Excellent!"
"I usually don't care for freeze dried fruit, but these are in a class by themselves.  They are cored and PEALED, and melt in your mouth delicious.  The same company makes the same product in separately decorated bags.  Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for Kids and Crisps for adults.  They are the exact same product, so if one is unavailable, you can purchase the other.  My favorite is Apple.  If you do purchase these, buy them through Amazon, as they sell them cheaper than the grocery store. These are really yummy and good for you too.  I am a grandmother, and this wonderful treat was introduced to me by my grand daughter. TL;DR Unbelievably delicious freeze dried apples"
"I don't know how people can complain about the taste of this product. I am not sure if they are expecting this to taste exactly like their regular durum semolina pasta but this product has a very acceptable taste and texture for my tastes. This product is the only organic sprouted grain pasta I am aware of and that brings a whole host of health and nutrition benefits. If the nutritional benefits of eating sprouted grains is important to you than I am sure you will find the taste acceptable.<br /><br />I recommend following the cooking directions and staying within the 3 to 4 minute range, I went to 5 minutes and but I tested it at the 3 minute mark, 4 minutes would be about right for me. This is a bolder tasting pasta, it is not as subtle tasting as regular pasta and if you are expecting that, then don't buy this product, plan and simple. Some people have mentioned that it has a 'nuttier' type taste to it and I can definitely agree with that description. It's a very subtle nutty taste though. If you are borderline on the taste, you might want to find a sauce that is bolder tasting.<br /><br />If you are new to non durum based pastas you might want to try going to a whole grain pasta first, which most of the major pasta manufacturers now make. If the taste doesen't bother you then I would try a box of this pasta. The texture of this pasta is on the firm side of al dente, if you try to cook it longer to soften it up it gets kind of gummy.<br /><br />Overall I would give this product a 4 out of 5 because I like the taste but I don't love the taste. It would also be nice if they could give you the option to cook this to various levels of firmness without turning to goo. That being said, I am completely aware that they are working within the constraints of the ingredients used and I think they have done a very good within the confines of the ingredient list. TL;DR Know what you are buying & set your expectations accordingly"
"These wafers remind me of those regular chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry wafers I was addicted to as a child...now if Glutino could only make those flavors gluten-free!  Yummy!!  Lemon flavored is a great start! TL;DR Addictive!"
"The boxed version is significantly less per ounce.  ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3SU"">McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal, Quick & Easy, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>""  When I last ordered, the price was $0.17 cents per oz, versus $.23 for the tins.  I keep the oatmeal from getting stale when I open a box by dumping it into an empty tin.  Nobody has to know that I'm cheap. :>)<br /><br />Same stuff, less money.  Can't complain about that... TL;DR Save money...order it in boxes instead of tins"
"We've tried a few gluten free bread mixes and so far Pamela's Products is in the clear lead.  This bread has a great texture, it slices nice and thin and holds up.  It has a nice ""chew"" to it and it is moist with a great crust.  It came with its own yeast and if you use a bread mixer - it bakes up in a breeze.  Its just to bad the taste is ""off""  kind of ""beany"" maybe?  My daughter, who we make the bread for, has this to say about it:  ""It tastes just blaaaah.  Its tasteless and it has a rubber after taste.""  We wont buy this again. TL;DR GREAT texture - weird taste."
"While I think this coffee is delicious and rich tasting, I would not call it a french roast.  I know many places that would not even call it a full-city roast.  The beans are medium brown, with a little bit of oil.  I would have expected much darker, oilier beans from a french roast.  There is no smoky or burnt flavor to it at all.  I really do like it, but I would have called it a breakfast blend, not a french roast. TL;DR yummy, but I would not call it a french roast"
"This is a very tasty cacao powder.  It arrived in an unmarked bag (does not have an organic symbol or product description) but it seems to be the real deal.  Good flavor, similar to or better than name brand powders I have purchased in the past.  Will definitely purchase again. TL;DR Super Delicious!"
I ordered the green tea and the cinnamon flavor one.  I savor the flavor everytime I have them.  I have them after lunch at work and then some nights when I need something soothing.  I would highly recommend the quality.  The packaging is impressive -- maybe overdone unless it contributes to its freshness.  Highly recommend it. TL;DR Great quality tea..one of the best I have had
This is an excellent desert which my Mother absolutely loves with a bit of cool whip on top.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has a gluten intolerance problem and loves chocolate.  It is also very easy to make. TL;DR Perfect
"These crackers are delicious and low fat...The perfect combination! I serve them with all kinds of soft cheeses and they are always the first to disappear. TL;DR 5 star crackers, great with cheese or alone"
"arrived quickly; apples disguise the broccoli a little, still has a bit of a broccoli hint, but not much.  Definitely great for quick snack or to add to another food for increased nutrition...especially the broccoli.  They're a little pricey, but worth the convenience & great ingredients. TL;DR convenient & healthy"
Perfect for the kids! My children are not HUGE water drinkers but I was able to persuade them to try this new cool black drink! It did the trick!<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of this product!!! TL;DR My kids LOVE it!
"Frankly, the flavor is nothing special.  There is no overtone of any Kahlua influence.  Dom Francisco vanilla nut, and hazelnut are just as good, if not better, at half the price. TL;DR Only O.K."
"Gary Regan's eponymous cocktail bitters are the best orange bitters available today.<br /><br />Not all cocktails are better with Angostura's classic bitters. Sometimes you want a little citrus lift in your drink. Although other orange bitters from Fee's, Stirring's  and Angostura itself are more widely available, they each have drawbacks. Fee's is overwhelmingly pungent... with orange extract notes that seem artificial. Antostura's Orange bitters don't have the magical concentration and complexity that regular Angostura has in spades. And Stirrings Orange Bitters aren't even bitters! TL;DR The best orange bitter available"
"I've been a Sanka fan ever since my Mother introduced me to this gourmet coffee when I was a kid. The flavor is full-bodied yet mild; smooth and uniquely satisfying. It reminds me of the excellent coffee I had while staying in Costa Rica one summer.<br /><br />A medley of the finest Arabica beans harvested from a multitude of premium world-class coffee plantations is used here and it shows! I blend in Coffee-mate Belgian Chocolate Toffee Creamer and the taste is to die for!<br /><br />Many of the finest hotels and restaurants offer their guests this same Sanka decaffeinated coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the masses, Kraft Foods doesn't promote the ""Sanka"" brand heavily because it competes with the sales of Maxwell House Decaffeinated Coffee. Too bad because Sanka is clearly superior to the Maxwell House labeled offering.<br /><br />As someone here mentioned, it is difficult to find Sanka in the local supermarkets - making this a great find! TL;DR Great Coffee, Great Value!"
--where I buy these rawhide rolls. They are tightly rolled and there's much more rawhide than the ones you see in pet stores. I give these as gifts to my dog friends. TL;DR PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK--
"Not the light brown stuff, the dark brown stuff and so good in my breve latte. TL;DR Dark Brown Sugar"
"These bars are bite size but they are the perfect 100 calorie snack, esp for those who crave chocolate. I didn't like the cookies n cream flavor but this flavor is excellent. And it's not just yummy for health nuts, I gave one to my boyfriend who is not health conscious, and even he loved it. TL;DR Delicious Snack - Low Cal"
"I regularly cook with onion, but don't always have the time or energy to dice fresh onions. This large container works out well. I put the onion into the cooking pot and get the desired flavor with no effort. The free shipping (Prime member) made the online purchase decision easy as well. TL;DR Chopped Onion"
"this is one of our main sources of proteins, with NO SALT ADDED! and yummy bones and skin left in!!  thanks be to salmon! TL;DR delicious and good for you"
"I purchased this item to use during my holiday cooking. Whenever I purchase liquid buttermilk, I don't use it all and end up tossing it. This works beautifully! I recommend storing it in your fridge or freezer to make sure it stays fresh! TL;DR Just like real buttermilk...without the waste"
"Vitamins and 40 mg.s of caffeine in a pretty typical fruit punch flavor.<br />Convenient, and definitely provides a little energy boost.<br />I would probably not buy it again because I would rather eat a piece of fruit, grab a handful of almonds and have a cup of green tea.<br />If those options aren't available for you, or are too much bother, you might enjoy having this around. TL;DR Good, if you go for vitamin, energy drinks"
"I've only recently become aware of the health benefits of drinking wheatgrass juice, but like many I can't stand the taste, and it's too much trouble to juice the grass myself.  Unless you live in California or someplace where juice bars are abundant, who's got time for that?<br /><br />I already use the Amazing Grass/Amazing Meal Chocolate flavor, especially for breakfast because I tend to skip that meal and it's an easy way to make sure I don't.  I usually mix a sleeve of this wheatgrass powder with Amazing Meal to get a little extra boost of nutrition without adding a ton of calories.  (Wheatgrass is already in Amazing Meal, but people probably wouldn't drink it if it tasted too ""green."") Also I like that I can conveniently store the one serving packs in my desk at work or in my tote, so I have no excuse.  Yes, it is a little gritty even when I blend it in my Vitamix, but that doesn't really bother me; I know it's not a milkshake and I feel good that I'm consuming a nourishing drink.  I have to say I was hoping for but haven't felt any significant energy boost as others have mentioned, but I figured a few extra greens couldn't hurt. TL;DR Health benefits and convenience"
My 12LB Chinese Crested Hairless will eat no other treats or dog cookie products.  Picky eater?? You bet! TL;DR Best according to Zacky-Boy!!
"Living in Hawaii, you cannot buy Molasses, and I was really wanting to buy some.  I to Amazon, since they usually have rare things. There were several sellers to select, but they all had the ""blackstapped"" molasses, and not the unsulphered type. Only Grandmas Molasses had the non-sulphured type.  I received it quickly, and would recommed this seller. TL;DR Wonderful Molasses"
"This brand did not help me with my milk supply.  I bought it because it was a little cheaper than the other brand on this site, and found this to be inferior.  The capsules smell like medicine, not maple syrup, and after 2 weeks of taking 3 pills, 3 x a day, I never got the maple syrup sweat like I did with the other brand.  I will be switching back and paying a little more for the quality. TL;DR Not a Good Brand for Milk Supply"
"This is an excellent value, compared to purchasing them individually.  Never been a big fan of vanilla, but the vanilla maple is my favorite.  It taste more like praline, really tasty.  Not crazy about the banana strawberry, but all the other flavors are good.  But none as good as the vanilla maple. Ordered the pumpkin too & that is my absolute favorite, really taste the pumpkin.  And all of the flavors are only 150 calories per pint. TL;DR Excellent value"
"I have four cats and they love this product. It is the only food I would consider giving them, since the stopped selling Dr. Weil's Pet Promise. There are very similar. TL;DR Best Catfood on the market"
"This is my favorite hot cereal. Cook as directed but let if sit for about 10 minutes before eating. They do not bill this as a 'diet' food but read the label, you will be surprised. This is wonderfully healthy! I just love, love, love this cereal! TL;DR Yum!!"
"this is, by far, the best tea mix!  it's made with splenda rather than aspartame and it's much  more natural & lighter tasting than any crystal light.  when i run out i get cranky so i'm very happy that i can order it from amazon and have it auto-shipped regularly and at a discounted rate. TL;DR my favorite tea mix"
"Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.<br /><br />This is soft food in the petite cans favored by the feline haute cuisine products. However, the similarity seems to end there as the product is flaked rather than sliced or diced, and the sauce is clear with an oily consistency (somewhat like vegetable or olive oil).<br /><br />The boy, Otis, will eat just about any soft cat food put in front of him and we were not disappointed with this product. The girl, Crystal, is the pickier of the pair and will usually lick a little of the food or sauce before abandoning any soft food (leaving the remnants for Otis). I was gratified to see that the product did not come out of China after the problems of the past year.<br /><br />Bottom line is that while the cats seem to like the product as much as any other soft food, they don't seem to like it that much more to balance the extra cost. TL;DR They Seem to Like It"
"YUMMY!!! Arctic Zero is delicious & has great nutritional stats.  Even though I never thought I'd eat the entire pint in 1 sitting, I did, but at least I didn't feel tooooo guilty.  I've tried the Choc & Choc PB.  Now I'm going to order the Vanilla.  Still on the fence about the Strawberry Banana.  Only negative is the price, but if you consider the 6 containers you get for $46, that's a little less than $8/container or pint.  Even if you eat 1/2 pint at a time, that's only $4.  You spend more than that buying an ice cream at your local ice cream shop, plus you're saving a ton of calories.  You can add on fresh fruit, whipped cream, etc. & make your own sundae's for a fraction of the calories.  GREAT STUFF!!!  Love it!!  Also, the containers were still frozen solid when they arrived! TL;DR YUMMY!!"
"First of, don't expect all seeds to grow.  There are casualty when it come to planting seeds, I guess.  It will take about 4-5 days before you see little leaves grow out from dirt.  Growing in nursery box is very helpful.  I am happy with the out come, with good care, hopefully it will continue to mature. TL;DR great!"
"I have four dogs ranging from a 7 pound Chihuahua, a 30 pound Chinese Crested, and 2 mixed dogs (15 and 25 pounds).  Three of them are rescue dogs and for some time now I have been feeding them what the Rescue was feeding them, Taste of the Wild by Diamond.  I was paying over $45 for a large bag of dog food that recently had the largest recall by Diamond.  My dogs are my babies and I have never had a scare like this before.  I never knew Diamond brands was known for recalling their pet foods.  After researching the internet for brands of pet foods that have never had a recall, I was shocked and impressed to see that Purina DOG food was the only one that never has.  They have had recalls on cat foods but never on dog food.  At least from the articles I found online. If you don't believe Google ""brands of dog food that has never had a recall"", Purina will be listed first.<br /><br />What I found interesting is that to me all dog foods smell ""disgusting"".  It might look appetizing with the different shapes and sizes and pretty colors but I always wondered how they can eat the stuff.  When I fed my pooches the Taste of The Wild, they always left food behind in their dishes.  Since feeding the Purina Beneful all four dishes are left empty.  I know Purina is considered the more ""middle"" brand of animal food, but it has been around for years and most important my dogs love it.  I will continue to feed them the Purina Beneful and give them daily vitamins and healthy treats to make sure they meet their daily recommended nutrition.  There are several varieties to pick from and plan on mixing things up for a little excitement! TL;DR I can't rate taste, but my dogs love it."
"Our vegan household is always pleased to find pup treats with fruits and veggies. I picked up a sample of these at the pet store and my two beautiful, healthy vegetarian Chi's devoured them. They are slightly chewy and full of all healthy ingredients. I give them these fruitable chewies in the morning with their apple barley oat biscuits. TL;DR Chihuahua Heaven - Great Price"
"Our local market sels the San Pell for $2 a can...so this is a GREAT PRICE!  However, I was a bit disappointed when in the discription is said they were glass bottles...however, when they arrived they were cans. TL;DR Great product, great price, but details are a bit misleading...."
"This is such good stuff, and it's quite healthy. It contains plenty of trace nutrients as well which are vital to our everyday functions, such as eukronium and phosphoric acid. My kids love it! This brand should serve as an example to the rest of this industry. TL;DR Good!!"
"I was very unhappy when I received my order today, I only had three different flavored coffees, I received 6 different favors of tea and all the rest were regular coffee, although there were different companies I received 5 house blend....I was hoping for some iced coffee and iced teas and received none. I will not purchase this variety pack again. TL;DR Don't be fooled by item description"
"Basically just what almonds are supposed to be.<br />Unroasted, unsalted, aka not as tasty as ones you'd munch on while drinking beer,<br />but healthy of course, which is the only reason I bought the product.<br />Tastes just like what you'd expect unroasted&unsalted almonds would taste like. I have absolutely no complaints. TL;DR What almonds are"
The product was received on time and in wonderful shape.  Saved me from going to the store and was cheaper! TL;DR pill pockets
"Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried. I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them. I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent. My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy. Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing. I don't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good, or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better, a sense of calm. I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care. TL;DR Delicious"
"We adopted our frenchie from the shelter about 7 months ago. She was 2-3 years old and not knowing anything about her history we just picked a random food and thought we'd experiment until she decided what she and her digestive track liked best. After several other brands including Blue Wilderness, Premium Edge, and Pinnacle, the search is over. Not only is Hi-Tek lamb & sweet potato her favorite (she has always scarfed down food, but this is scarfed down with a vengeance), but it seems to settle well in the sense that while on this food she has consistent and solid number twos unlike some of the others which have given her intermittent diarrhea.<br />With my previous dogs I had always been an Iams fan, in fact our 2 English bulldogs lived to be 14 eating nothing but Iams. But with the frenchie we decided to go grain-free, one because it's just healthier and two because she did have ear infections when we got her (I read that grain allergies can be manifested this way). She's been ear-infection free since about the first month, has a healthy coat and tons of energy which may be attributed in part to her grain-free diet in general rather than any particular food. Yes trying 4 brands over 7 months might seem silly but we did slowly blend them to transition her each time, and gave ample time to monitor how she did on each. Happy to have found a winner, Hi-Tek lamb & sweet potato.<br />Thanks Amazon for offering this product at a decent price with fast and free shipping, I'll continue to buy it here for those reasons. TL;DR My french bulldog's favorite food thus far"
Nine pounds of gummy worms is a lot.  The worms were packaged to me in two non-resealable unlabeled bags.  They taste like your average sour gummy worms. TL;DR Worms!
"I love seaweed salad from Sushi places.  I gave this a try so I could have some on hand for snacks or lunches.  I let it soak for 15 minutes and that was a little too long for my taste.  It absorbed a little too much water - I like it firmer than it turned out.  I will try about 10 minutes the next time and see how it does.  Over all, I like it and would order it again. TL;DR Pretty good!"
"This is a ""subscription"" to Product 19 -- an excellent cereal product not generally available in my area. I get four boxes every three months and (so far) that's been about right. The cereal sent is well-packed and the use-by dates are always well into the future, so it's fresh when received and used.<br /><br />  No complaints. TL;DR Four of a kind -- Product 19."
Worked OK but these Stakes catch only a few of the irritating critters and certainly won't eliminate them. We ended up throwing away our few houseplants and starting over with new ones. TL;DR Safer Sticky Stakes
"I have purchased this product several times.  The individual lollipops are now sealed much better than they were, and the additional flavors are great.<br />They are really tasty and sweet, just not sickly sweet. TL;DR Delicious lollipops"
"This product does taste good, sort of like a Mango Drink.  However, the cancer claim I'm not sure about.  My wife has cancer and she started drinking it.  Problem is about 4 days after starting her cancer came back harder than before.  We have since gone through 2 surgeries one being a Plurex installed in her chest cavity and a blood clot was found in her lung.  Was it the drink?  Don't know but it does taste good.  I'm drinking it too and have been on it for 1 month.  Had a physical on 9 April and my blood pressure is down from 131 to 117.  Was it the drink?  Don't know but it does taste good. TL;DR Amazon Juice for Cancer?"
"I found the taste of this product very good and I enjoyed eating the cereal. However, when I compared this with a Kashi cereal, it had less protein and fiber than the Kashi products for about the same price. Just in case you are looking for the highest protein and fiber content. TL;DR GOOd but..."
Hello<br /><br />It was my favorite flavor and always purchased from Rite Aid but since last 9 months they stopped carrying it so I turned to Amazon and I got my shipment pronto.<br />This is the best spice chai.... TL;DR Masala Chai
"This little stocking stuffer is my 2 year old's favorite Christmas toy. His projects a soccer ball. He doesn't even know there's candy in it. The light is bright and projects well. I can't comment on the candy since that part is still sealed. This is one of those great little novelty trinkets that makes little kids so excited. Ee got only one, at a store, but I am considering buying this 12 pack to always have a laser projector pop on hand for a treat/bribe. TL;DR 2 year old loves it---doesn't even know there's candy inside!"
"At first, my cat Timmy was hesitant to try the unusual looking cat food I put before him--a cross between spam and chicken soup. But after he gave it a few sniffs, it was chowed down in minutes. Timmy quickly devoured what appeared to be a delicacy to him.<br /><br />To me, it looked too healthy to appeal to a feline, with its obvious chunks of veggies and solid pieces of meat, nicely moistened by a broth. The can is compact and easy to store and the portion size is just right for one cat's healthy appetite. Normally, a regular can of food like Friskies or Whiskas will only get half eaten, but there was no waste here. The food was polished off with a meticulous licked-clean plate, evidence of Timmy's approval of this latest offering.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine is not cheap, but it is on the lower end for the ""gourmet"" cat foods and you get quality ingredients.  Each 4-pack I received also came with coupons worth up to $2 in savings so that is an added bonus.<br /><br />All in all, a good cat food worth it's cost.  Timmy has already put in a request to sample the fish flavors.  :) TL;DR A Petite Treat"
"I asked ""Swanson Health Products"" for an answer to my question: Would you be so good as to tell me if the process being use to purify the fructose is the Castner-Kellner process (commonly used)? Their reply: After speaking with several Product Specialists and a Supervisor, we were unable to locate additional information on how the swanson 100% premium fructose item #SW1083 is processed.<br /><br />Now I ask you; how could they know if it is 100% pure? TL;DR No response to a vital question!"
We have tried several brands of popcorn in out upright popper. Frankly we cannot find a great difference thus we look for price. While our unit takes a 6 oz bag we find we can use either the four ounce or 8 ounce bags just as well. The lid always lets the excess popped corn fall out of the popper when we use the larger eight ounce bag. In this case we had the 6 ounce. The corn popped well with only a few unpopped grains remaining. The butter  seasoning held well in the package. This is a pet peeve as we have found some brands where the seasoning and oil remains liquid thus making it difficult for us to empty the bag into the popper. Shipment for excellent. TL;DR Very Good Popcorn
"Great price on very good maple syrup.  We own a bed and breakfast (the Grice-Fearing House B&B in Elizabeth City, NC) and we serve a lot of maple syrup.  Arrived very quickly, too! TL;DR Very good maple syrup."
"One of our cats has a tonne of dandruff.  Had, I should say.  We switched from Science Diet for skin to the Royal Canin, and her dandruff isn't completely gone, but it's definitely better!  Plus, she finds it to be YUMMY :) TL;DR Cat loves it, and keeps skin nice!"
"This is a great coffee if you like the taste of a dark robust brew. I like it myself, but my wife says it's a touch on the strong side. I've cut back on the amount of coffee I use for our brew cycle. The taste is satisfying and is not bitter at all.  If you like a dark Colombian, give it a try. TL;DR Cafe' Altura Colombian Dark ---  Wow; it's got some strength"
I love the Phillippine dried mango products because they are not too dry and have a very authentic mango flavor.  One of my favorite snacks. TL;DR Delicious!
"Thanks to Roland for adding a very small amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to these sliced button mushrooms grown in China.  Vitamin C not only helps to preserve the freshness of these mushrooms but also blocks the formation of cancer-causing nitrosamines, which tend to always form in all salted foods.  Scientific studies from China have good news for mushroom lovers:  [Please click ""Comment""] TL;DR Roland adds a pinch of ascorbic acid (vitamin C)"
"I love that this is high protein, high fiber, low carb. Great nutritional content, and much cheaper than the grocery store. I have purchased this pack of 6 twice. I would give the first order 5 stars, but I give this order 2 stars. The reason: the second order was well within the expiration date, but has a musty smell. It tastes ok, but even after being cooked still has a musty smell. I will probably order again, but maybe try a different seller. In sum, I would recommend this product, but the quality was not consistent. TL;DR Mixed bags"
"We use it mainly for frying up chicken strips and sometimes mushrooms.  We were buying it one box at a time from Martin's or Krogers, so I figured why not go the ""pallet"" route and buy a whole carton.  Best decision I ever made in my entire life, not like some horrible decisions I've made, including buying 25,000 shares of Facebook on opening day.  My wife is made at me about that, but I don't care. TL;DR My family loves this stuff!"
"My husband and I are big coffee drinkers, at least between the two of us we have 80 years' experience.  We drink many different brands and typically prefer flavored coffees.  I tried Luzianne based upon my experience with this brand for other food products, the other reviews, and because Amazon ran it at a pretty good price, $5.28 per pound, including the super saver shipping.  The first thing after brewing the coffee this morning, I asked my husband what he thought of it.  His response:  ""It's coffee, nothing special.""  I'd have to second that assessment.  This is a medium, leaning to light, brew and will start your morning off if you need coffee.  However, we are used to more full-bodied medium blends that satisfy more. TL;DR We've had better"
"I have been using Pill Pockets for years and am VERY disappointed that Greenies changed the ingredients. Not only are they not as moist, but they removed the probiotic which aids in digestion. They say only the packaging has changed, but I had an old package and compared the ingredients and they are DEFINITELY different. It is still a Good way to give a pill, but not as healthy or tasty. I have even found unknown pieces of hard stuff in some, (I use to break them up and roll into balls and give as treats. I have tried to track down any of the originals, but unfortunately, they seem to be all gone. So, if you need to give your cat a pill, buy them, I just don't give them as treats anymore. Sad that such a great product has gone from a 10 to a 4, in my opinion. And what's sadder, I wrote to Greenies about the ingredients  about 3 months ago and I have yet to hear a thing from them... Not very good customer relations. TL;DR Change Not Always Good"
"This coffee is truely jet fuel.  It has a strong bold flavor and is not bitter.  The name says it all.  One cup of this and you will be well on your way to a productive day.  I love it!!! TL;DR Strong, Bold, not bitter"
"One of the BEST new products I have tried this year (2012). Unlike some other meals, in simi;ar pachages, this is fully cooked ,and ready eat in just 60 seconds!<br /><br />I became aware of this product at a ""craft service"" table on a television shoot that went in to the wee hours - it is really good!  Perfect for a lunch, or perhaps a side-dish.  Or... when you get home, and are too tired to cook ANYTHING ( been there, done THAT ).<br /><br />Barilla has always had good pasta and sauce, and this flavor should be familar to you, if you have tried them before.  The KEY feature here is ease of prep. If you can, add in some grated cheese and a salad, and you have a meal in minutes.<br /><br />While popular on TV and movie sets, this could easily be a a terrific ""comfort food"" gift for seniors, college students, or perhaps someone not feeling up to par.<br /><br />I like the spicy formula, though there are several others, without the minor ""kick"".  Is it ""al-dente""?, no, but is it darn good. Plate it (or even paper-plate it) and you will enjoy a fast-casual premium dining option.<br /><br />The Amazon price is great, and is LOWER than what I saw in a wharehouse store this weekend- the individual packs are around $4.00 each, at regular retail, and are well worth it.<br /><br />Do consider this for yourself, it is a bit of everyday luxury.  And, like I said, consider those seniors, and college students - I ASSURE you this would be a most welcome gift! TL;DR Ultra FAST, this is the 60 Second soultion!  GREAT Taste, too!"
"I was recently given the opportunity to try Izze Sparkling Grapefruit Juice, and I am very glad I did!  With none of the added sugars contained in similar products, Izze relies on its own taste to draw the consumer in, and the addition of the sparkling water enhances the flavor rather nicely.  If you are a consumer who enjoys all natural flavor with a little pizzazz to it, then Izze is definitely the product for you! TL;DR A thoroughly enjoyable product"
"A 1000 count order lasts me a year and it's my second time purchasing it.  Not only is it convenient but I can't get over the savings.  When I see this product offered in the store in smaller sizes at expensive prices, I just smile and keep on walking!  Thanks amazon.com! I decided to see if the shipper really sent me 1,0000 packets (who would be crazy enough to count them, right?) and I'm happy to report all 1000 are accounted for! I highly recommend Truvia in 1000 count packages! TL;DR The price was as great as the quanity"
"I absolutely love my Chai latte and begin every day with it. It tastes great and has enough caffeine in it to keep me going though the day. Everyone on Facebook knows how much I love my Chai latte.<br /><br />Marilyn<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005I56ZYM"">Bears With Us</a> TL;DR My Favorite First Drink of the Morning"
"Even though this is advertised as  gluten free the disclaimer says "" *This product is GLUTEN free, therefore; it made in a kitchen, which may contain gluten product in it. We do not recommend it for high gluten allergen person"". Since most products are made in a kitchen, I think they are trying to say that  no containing gluten ingredients are used but I am not sure. TL;DR not really gluten free."
"Yum Yum!!! I bought a case of these for a camping trip my daughter was going on with her cross country team...they LOVED them. Good flavor, texture, and a nice substitute for other cheesey flavored snacks. TL;DR Great substitute for other cheese puffs"
"This is an early film in Tim Burton's career,shortly after Pee Wee's Big Adventure where you get to see his off humor,art and design poured into the film.This is a Tim Burton classic hands down and I love the humor put into the story(spoken or not).Some strong four letter metephores are thrown upon occassion in some of the dialog,so parents beware if you have little ones watching.Other than that,you have an entertaining story of a young couple who die sudenly and are thrown into the world of the dead without a clue of how,why and what to do?Pathetic attempts are made to scare and rid their home of an undesireable yuppie family.In desperation(even after being warned) they decide to employ the gifts and tallents of Beettlejuice,and it turns out they get more than they bargined for.I only wish there was more screen time with Michael keaton/Beettlejuice,it is damn funny.While the living mingle with the dead in an effort to make a circus of their ""paranormal hosts"" Beetlejuice is put into action again by Lydia to save them.So,""say it once,say it twice...third time is the charm!""Experience Beettlejuice for yourself,and if you are a Tim Burton fan or new to his films,you are in for a real treat. TL;DR ""I'm the ghost with the most babe"""
"This is distinctly different than Gran Riserva!  While this is good balsamic vinegar, it is not great.  We had previously purchased Fattoria Estense's Gran Riserva in the short squat bottle (same # of oz)and it was amazing.  This vinegar is much sharper and thinner.  It does not have the thick sweet quality of the Gran Riserva.  The Gran Riserva you could easily serve on ice cream - this, no. TL;DR Not as good as Gran Riserva!!!"
I have these still in my jellybean jar.<br />They are nice and soft not like the waxy type.<br />Fruity flavors are fabulous. TL;DR Yum Yum
"Since I travel for my business, and Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast, I have tasted Hollandaise Sauce from many places all across North America - from Georgia to Alaska and Newfoundland to Northwest Territories.<br /><br />I suspect that much (maybe most) of the best Hollandaise sauce to be found in restaurants is made using this mix. It is yummy.<br /><br />It's easy to prepare, although it requires about five minutes of your undivided attention.<br /><br />Two Tips:<br />1.  With the large container, you save a LOT over the smaller packets. However, the smallest quantity you can make using the directions on the container is 1-2/3 quart. So, to make only one cup, ...<br /><br />Yield: 1 cup<br />Mix: 1 Fl. Oz.<br />Milk: 4.8 Fl. Oz.<br />Butter: 4.8 Tbs<br /><br />I don't think you have to measure the amounts REALLY carefully. I have been getting increasingly ""relaxed"" about my measuring, and it still comes out fine.<br /><br />2.  The first cup I made was very salty. I don't know if it was the salted butter, or that the mix had settled in the container. Regardless, I recommend, 1) that you shake up the container before the first use to ensure the mix is mixed, and 2) that you use unsalted butter.<br /><br />Lastly, in an attempt to be witty, I offer the following observation. Looking at the ingredients, note that no chickens are involved in the production of this stuff. Rather the mix is made with chicken FOOD (autolyzed and hydrolyzed) plus thiamine hydrochloride. It is reasonable to infer that the chicken's digestive system does the autolyzing and hydrolyzing, and her ovaries use thiamine hydrochloride to produce egg yolk. Thus, this food is truly ""green"" - omitting the energy-wasting, green-house gas-producing chicken. TL;DR Great Taste, Smooth Texture, and Even I Can Do It Right"
"I was given the 3-pack by a friend of mine and I have to say that this person is definitely my best friend for life. I should begin by stating that I LOVE chicken wings - I try them everytime I see them on a menu. Since trying these rubs, however, especially the Finger Lickin', I just can't bring myself to try them any place else.  The rub is perfectly spicy, perfectly smoky and leaves you craving more. We grill up these bad boys at least once a week in our household, but I have also marinated whole chickens, spiced up some grilled shrimp and even added to popcorn. AMAZING. The levels of heat are, shall we say, pretty extreme. The Easy Pickin' is for those of you that like a teeny-tiny amount of heat in your dishes (think poblano), Finger Lickin' for those a little more adventuresome (think jalapeno) and for those of you that ski the Black Diamonds, well, you really should try What Was I Thinkin' (think Ghost Pepper, times 4). The first bite I took made me kinda giggle like, hey, I got this. I defeat you Ghost Pepper. Then....it....hit. I have never sweated, cried and guffawed all at the same time. It was, truly, an unreal experience and I'm ever so grateful I tried it.<br /><br />I sure hope you give these a shot. You will truly be impressed with the flavor sensations!!! TL;DR The Rub You Crave"
These are the best pretzels.  I can't believe they are gluten-free and taste great.  Our family actually like them better than regular pretzels. TL;DR Absolutely Great
"I have an older dog who has a lot of health problems. He had skin allergies, hot spots, joint pains and other ailments. Every since he has been on the Wellness dog food, he is like a young pup again. He doesn't have any skin problems and seems to have so much more energy than he before.<br /><br />I also appreciate the quality of the ingredients that is in this dog food and only wish I would have discovered Wellness years ago. TL;DR Best dog food ever"
"Caffe Verona K-cups are not available from what I can see in the Upstate NY area.  The Keurig is a Godsend for avid coffee drinkers like me!  Fast, reliable, great-tasting coffee every time.  I won't drink that gas station dirty water stuff. TL;DR Great product, fast shipping..."
"Plain TVP, without flavoring or other ingredients added, really doesn't vary so much between brands. It's always going to be on the mushier side if you try to, say, make a burger with TVP alone. And it's going to absorb the flavor of whatever broth, seasonings or other foods you're cooking it with.<br /><br />I try to keep this product on-hand because it's a quick, easy and inexpensive way to keep protein around. Added to rice with seasonings, a splash of oil, broth and a bit of hot sauce, it's a quick, easy and relatively complete meal. Add veggies, extra broth and eggs, and you have a hearty, flavorful soup. It's versatile and the price here is excellent. TL;DR I love TVP!"
There was a weird after taste. I found that 1/4 of a good vanilla extract and 1-2 table spoons of powder sugar work a lot better. For the liquid I use almond milk or soy milk. If you use a flavored milk you might want to go light on the sugar. TL;DR ok but not great
"very filling, great taste, I love it with non-sweetened Silk. it is cheaper on amazon than in the grocery store. TL;DR great cereal"
I just recently started buying this food for my 2 cats and I must say they really seem to enjoy it.  Even the chihuahua has been enjoying it much to the cats chagrin.  The only problem with it is that it seems to make my cats a bit smellier than before. TL;DR It must taste good
kinda small. I mean the items were good and my mom loved them (they were a present) but I had really expected...something more I guess... TL;DR meh
"I've ordered this product twice, and I was pleased both times.<br /><br />It comes in a sealed plastic container, wrapped in the green plastic typical of Amazon food orders. The sour strips are soft and fresh. There's no particular flavor to them - just sweet chewy strips covered in sour crystals.<br /><br />The only downsides to the product are common to all sour strips in general: they leave citric acid crystals everywhere, they get hard if left out in the open, and they can cause mouth or stomach pain. Be careful, eat in moderation, and you'll enjoy these for a long time! TL;DR Pleasantly sour and tasty"
If you like the taste of Bergamot the Stash's Premium Double Bergamot is smooth and delightful tasting. My first order occurred as a mistake as I meant to order Stash's Earl Grey and didn't note the Double Bergamot listing.  I find that I prefer the Earl Grey Double Bergamot taste as do several other members of our friends. TL;DR Bergamot Delight
We have used sucanat for about 5 yr. now and my Husband uses only sucanat on his hot or cold cereal . It has become a stapel in our home. TL;DR sucanat
"Didn't know what I would think of this flavor when I first bought it.  My husband was especially skeptical.  It turns out that it's my favorite summertime flavor and he's good with it too.  It's just the right amount of flavor without going overboard.  Who knew coconut and coffee would go together so well?  But I guess if you think about it, lots of ""nut"" flavors blend well with coffee.  In any case, I love it.  Highly recommend. TL;DR My Favorite Summer Flavor"
"I was looking for a mix like McCormicks Medley blend which has the 4 types of peppercorns, coriander and allspice. This was the closest I could find, minus the allspice. This blend has great flavor. The only problem is the coriander is so large that it's hard to get into the grinder and the grinder gets plugged up, having to reverse grind. I do have a very nice William Bounds grinder, so it's not the grinders fault. TL;DR Nice mix, but.."
"My kids loved this mix!  We made it into cupcakes and they turned out so moist and chocolately that the kids were eating them before I had a chance to frost them.  It's hard to find anything gluten-free they really like, so we definitely will be buying more. TL;DR No Frosting Needed!"
These are great. Makes the best gift ever! I downloaded a bunch of uses and make a mini recipe book / scrap book to give when I give them as gifts. People flip their lids. LOVE them! Highly recommend. TL;DR Shake that Salt
Just what I was looking for. Great for coffee drinkers when it's<br /> 110 degree outside. I will definitely be ordering more TL;DR MMMMMMMM YUM!!
"These are excellent treats that I would recommend to almost any dog owner. After purchasing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CI9X4"">Bil-Jac Little Jacs Liver Treats</a> while in a rush at the store, and then reading the ingredients list, I knew that I didn't want to purchase anything with additives and low-grade chicken any more! My wife and I picked these up at a pet store and so far we have been quite pleased!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Contains NO chicken by-products*<br />- Contains no wheat**<br />- Perfect size for puppies, small dogs or training<br />- Also available at pet stores<br /><br />CONS<br />- A tad pricey<br />- Give some dogs loose stools<br /><br />*While this product doesn't contain chicken by-products, don't be fooled into thinking that it contains high-grade chicken. This is definitely better than most dog treats, but it's not on par with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CR41KQ"">Newman's Own Organic Chicken Treats</a> or <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TL2XN4"">Flint River Ranch Dog Treats</a>, that use human-grade meat and poultry.<br /><br />**Some dogs are allergic to wheat. If your dog has allergies or even is beginning to show symptoms, wheat should be the first thing you cut out. Many MANY foods contain it as a filler, and many allergies are traced back to it.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />These are a little pricey, but you are paying for a healthy, nutritious treat, not some WalMart-grade by-product infused junk. If you care about your dog, you need to feed them with the best food and treats available, and these Chicken Bits are a great place to start! TL;DR Head and shoulders above the rest!"
"Great crispy gluten free cereal! I like this a lot better than Erewhon rice cereal. Erewhon is overly sweetened, and not as crispy. I order this in bulk because its so good. Thank you Barbaras Bakery! TL;DR Great crispy gluten free cereal!"
"Nature's Variety is a great food at a fair price!  This food has none of the typical cheap fillers that most store bought dog foods have, like corn, soy, and wheat.  It also has no artificial preservatives, like ethoxyquin, BHA, or BHT.  I also like that you can rotate between proteins with minimal/no digestive upset, since the main formula is the same, aside from the meat source.  Every time I buy a 30lb bag, I change proteins.  They have chicken, beef, lamb, salmon, and venison.<br /><br />I've fed Nature's Variety to two of my four dogs for the past three years- their coats look great, and they have been exceptionally healthy since being on the food.  I highly recommend this food! TL;DR Great food at a fair price"
I love the coffee pods... And I love the fact that Amazon sells them in bulk.... Thanks... TL;DR coffee pods
"Fast shipping, and looked healthy and full when unpacked. I had gotten another bonsai (looked similar, a small juniper) at a garden expo, and it was dead within a month. This new plant is luscious after two months, just followed the simple instructions. I used the tiny ceramic Japanese man from my first plant with this second one, and he obviouly likes sitting under this beautiful one much better! TL;DR Lovely little tree"
"I had these flowers sent to my Mom for her birthday, and they arrived right on time. She says they look great, and there are so many, that she made two very large bouquets out of them.  She received them yesterday and a few flowers hadn't bloomed yet, and but they opened overnight, which shows you how really fresh they are.<br /><br />Just as an FYI: be aware of the shipping charge. I had thought these would be 'included' in the 'things that ship for free' from Amazon, but no, since the flowers are from another vendor, there's an $10.99 fee. It's worth it, for timely, beautiful flowers, in large quantity. TL;DR Fresh flowers, look terrific, fast delivery, but be aware of $11 shipping"
"I was the loser in high school, the chicks would run away from me and the dudes would wrap me up in duck tape and throw me into the river saying ""Why are you at our school  you 30-year-old pervert?"" But one, I came into school with Skippy Creamy Penut Butter spread out all over my chest and my life changed. Girls started to lick my chest or faint at the sight of me, men would turn in shame, and teachers would give me weird looks and make me pass my class because of the Penut Butter. This is a great complement for me three wolf moon t-shirt<br /><br />A word of warning though, if you leave the penut butter on for too long, it will cause a rift in time sending you back to when you were a loser and didn't have a Nintendo 64 or a three wolf moon t-shirt. TL;DR Skippy changed my life"
I found this chai mix at a local coffee shop and loved it!  Then I was able to buy this online at Amazon and have been delighted! The auto ship works great for me.  B TL;DR best chai mix out there!
"I love to make my own soup particularly in the wintertime but Campbell's Select has a winning recipe in its Chicken with Egg Noodles.  The chicken, veggies and noodles are good size and plentiful.  When you have neither the time or inclination to make your own soup, this is a satisfying alternative.  It is delicious. TL;DR Home made quality"
"Love these jelly beans, I'm basically addicted to them but they are soooo expensive at the local drug store (about $4.00/bag), so I buy in bulk.  Every flavor is good, I keep them on my desk at work and all my co-workers love to stop by and take a couple.  You won't be disappointed they are the perfect mix of sweet and sour.  I'm already needing to order another box :) TL;DR Favorite Jelly Beans EVER!"
"As the mother of three children, two of whom are Celiacs, I can honestly say... I love this stuff!  It has a very nice taste, very nice texture, and it's SAFE for my children to eat. We don't have to worry about toxic grains with this one. It's chocolately, without being ""too"" chocolatey. And, it's small enough that it's not a choking hazzard for little ones. TL;DR As Rachael Ray would say... YUM - O!!"
"I got tired of grinding beans in the morning and I discovered this Via, it's a revelation, great tasting coffee in an instant without the""instant coffee flavor "" disappointment. TL;DR Great flavor in no time at all"
I buy this product at Kroger and I love it.  It tastes great and is healthy. TL;DR I like this product
I like this orange marmalade.<br />It's sweet and delicious.<br />I have never eaten this before.<br />BUT!! I really enjoy this now! TL;DR very good marmalade!
"This popcorn is one of my favorite sweet treats of all time! I must confess that I do watch what I eat, but when I want to enjoy something delicious and chewy and over-the-top good, I EAT POPSALOT POPCORN!<br /><br />The Clandestine caramel corn is so rich and tasty - not like other popcorn that are just overly sweet and boring. Then, the geniuses added CASHEWS, not just boring old peanuts, and WOW! I am in Love!<br /><br />If you want to send someone a special treat for Valentine's Day, Hanukkah, to make up for something you did wrong or whatever, BUY THIS POPCORN! TL;DR Yummiest Popcorn EVER!"
"Although I still prefer my 'real' sugar, this is the best substitute I've found so far. TL;DR Better than the other substitutes!"
"Just received my first order today.  I purchased lots of different styles of this company's products and will review each one as I try them.  Well packaged and delivered, 2 packs had lost their vacuum.  Was given 2 different samples to try and will review those as well when I taste them.  I consider myself somewhat of an unofficial jerky connoisseur, even making my own jerky in the past.  I like the meat to shine through the taste, not sugar or salt.  A vegetarian I am not!<br /><br />Tasted my first pepperoni mild short shot today.  Upon the first bite I noticed it didn't have squishy fat oozing out of it like I remember these types of beef sticks having years ago when I ate them as a kid.  It had a mild pepperoni taste, not hot, not spicy.  Was that a slight hint of vinegar behind the nuance of flavor?  Had a nice, firm mouth-feel and a slight 'snap' around the edges when bitten into.  Wasn't hit with any sweet, and it certainly wasn't over salted.  Over-all, I rate this product high on the beef stick scale.  These weren't dried out, they were supple.  As a treat, I gave my dog a couple inches of it.  When his face came up to my hand and his nose hit the beef-stick, his eyes sort of rolled back in his head, Ha! To say the least, he loved it too!<br /><br />I have put all the packs of beef into my big freezer so they stay fresh and hold their integrity, since I bought over 150.00 worth (free shipping with 125.00 or more, at this time!)  I started a low carb diet and these are the perfect snack item to have on hand.  The beef is USA grown!  I would reorder these mild pepperoni short sticks again. TL;DR Meaty and Delicious"
"I may not be a culinary expert, but I know taste.  This basil has a more intense and better flavor than I had experienced with any other dried basil.  I highly recommend it. TL;DR Excellent Quality"
These granola bars are now what I worship. They sort of taste like the crisp part of  a kit kat to me. TL;DR So good
"I've tried them all and this one ranks up there with the best (if you have a pod machine); and the best I've had from this brand; honest to goodness Kona flavor just like I drank on the islands. If you like a full-bodied cup and like Kona flavor (who doesn't), you won't be dissapointed with this one! It's top notch and worth the price!! Cheers!!! TL;DR Top Quality - Real Hawaiian!!"
The product was received in timely order and in perfect condition. The mincemeat pies that my wife made were delicious. TL;DR Outstanding
"Hands down this is one of the best prepared soups out there. Add 4 1/2 to 5 cups of water.  After it's cooked (about 30 to 45 minutes), I add yogurt to the bottom of the serving bowl, pour in the soup and mix. The yogurt helps to enhance the other spices. I sometimes add salt to this soup.  Yum!  It really is a favorite in my home.  If you love soups...try it.  You'll be pleasantly surprised at how good it is. TL;DR Delicious!"
"It is indeed a ""rich and creamy chocolaty delight"" if you use the smallest cup size on your machine.  Remember to shake the box well before using.  Some cocoa still remains in the K-cup after brewing, but regardless, you get a very satisfying cup of hot cocoa! TL;DR Became an instant favorite!"
"I've been a long-time consumer of Maxwell House International Coffee drink mixes, but I had never tried the Pumpkin Spice Latte flavor before. I've always loved their mocha and ""Vienna"" flavors, so I was excited to try this seasonal flavor. It definitely hit the spot! It takes almost the same as the Starbucks version of the drink. The pumpkin flavor isn't overwhelming, it's mild, but I prefer it this way. The spice and sweetness are, in my opinion, just right.<br /><br />One thing I noticed about this mix specifically is that it foamed up at the top quite a bit more than any of the other flavors. I loved the foam on the top, just like a real coffee house latte.<br /><br />Whenever I buy these Maxwell House mixes at the store I cringe a little bit at the cost (I'm a cheapskate at the store), but then I always remind myself that I'm often willing to pay $5 a drink when I go to a coffee shop. So I have started to really prefer the Maxwell House mixes not only because it saves me money in the long run (one can costs less than one of my regular drinks at the shop!) and I can also be assured of the taste & quality ALL the time. It can be hit or miss at the coffee shop, sometimes the barista doesn't quite hit the mark on my drink and I end up disappointed and feeling like I wasted money.<br /><br />One thing I will say about this mix, as I've noticed with all Maxwell House International Coffees, is that I always end up using more mix than the directions say to use. Using the recommended amount makes for a weak drink. Also, I like some flavors made with water, some to be mixed in with actual coffee, and some are better made with milk. This is one I think does well with milk, perhaps it's the latte part?<br /><br />Having tried one of their seasonal flavors now I'm excited to try more, I think I'll branch out a little. I have never tried a Maxwell House mix I didn't like, so far! I also think these cans make for excellent treats, perfect for gift baskets, care packages, stocking stuffers, etc. I liked the size and the new label design. I won't hesitate to gift some this holiday season. TL;DR Saves my money from the big chains!"
"This is a great natural nutrition. Most people don't eat enough vegetables in a day and this wheat grass rich in vitamins, minerals and other nutrition to replace the lack of greens. 1 scoop should give enough serving of vegetables for the day. I combine it with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039ITKR4"">Nutrex Hawaii Hawaiian Spirulina Pacifica Powder, 16-Ounce Bottle</a> to make yummy smoothie in the morning. TL;DR Great product for your health"
"I liked the taste of this one. On the box they made it look like the biscuts would have chocolate gushing out, but it didn't. However, it was chocolatey and sweet. It also stayed crunchy in milk. Will purchase again. TL;DR Sweet & Chocolatey"
"the tea is fine, slightly weak, but how in the world did they come up with such a high price? Its foolish to buy it through Amazon sellers when there are other areas to buy it cheaper. My local grocery store (Giant) sells it cheaper! TL;DR cheaper at local grocery store"
Came across this when I visited the restaurant some years ago and have been a faithful devotee ever since. Use it with absolutely everything and you won't be disappointed. TL;DR Magic in a Bottle
"Crackers are okay, had been broken into small pieces. Not discounted enough to compensate for the breakage. Would not buy again. TL;DR Crackers are okay."
sometimes it feels like chewing on paper..flavor is not very good either...will not recommend it again.. TL;DR very dry and hard to chew
This is the best hot mustard ever.  There's nothing else like it.  I'm eating it on a cheese sandwich right now. TL;DR OH MY GAWD!!!
"We purchased this honey to go in our vinegar/honey ""miracle"" tea... it's very smooth and absolutely yummy. haha.  I highly appreciate the fact it is organic - in fact, I was looking for organic.  YS Organic Bee Farms Pure Premium Clover Honey is definitely a great buy.  This is Organic for Less...and it's the best! TL;DR Very Yummy!"
"I have to admit, this is probably one of the best sugar free hot chocolate's I've ever tried.  That said, it's an adequate replacement for the real thing at best.  I usually drink a BIG mug with 2 packets, so I'll probably use one packet and some of this.  However for over $10 a can I'm NOT impressed!!!  Totally not worth it!!!!! TL;DR Taste?  3 stars.  Price? 1 star."
"howdy y'all,<br /><br />other such products have tended to be rather dry - or sometimes dried to a hard lump. this is soft, moist, chewy, and tasty. the slices are just the right size - convenient bites that are good on their own and better on a sandwich.<br /><br />the packages are also a very handy size. i always use the pack up long before the contents start to go bad.<br /><br />rated a FOUR cuz it is better than expected.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee TL;DR tasty and _not_ dry"
well it was nice that they showed up early but they were all broken into itty bitty pieces. i didnt order pieces of cookies i ordered whole cookies. TL;DR crappy cookies
"There is nothing too terribly exciting about this granola bar.<br />I mean, it isn't awful. I enjoy the blend of the dark chocolate and the whole grains, but it isn't as if there aren't other dark chocolate and granola/grainy granola bars.<br />It is satisfying, flavourful, and enjoyable, but to me, it's nothing to rave about. If someone was looking for a whole-grain/more healthy nutrition bar with dark chocolate, would I recommend this? Maybe. It probably wouldn't be my first choice/recommendation, though I would tell them about it and what I thought. It is good, and I don't doubt that most people would find it enjoyable. But, I guess, there was nothing super grand or superb about it that makes it stand out compared to other bars (other than the name, maybe).<br /><br />Again: it's not bad, it tastes just fine, but it didn't really animate me (or my tatebuds) like other foods have. If you like more whole grains and a bit of dark chocolate, I'd say: go for it. If not, that is okay, too. TL;DR sweet munchy"
"This product has improved several issues for me. For one, I have sensitive skin & so my scalp becomes irritated rather easily. Within 2 days of using this shampoo (& just the shampoo at the time, so imagine how much better the results when using the conditioner as well), I noticed a reduction in the number AND size of scalp bumps I had. Also, in recent years I have had major issues with tangles. Well, this shampoo left my hair so soft after just the first use even, I don't at all have to worry about struggling to comb my hair through when I use it. And now I see they have multiple products I can use, specifically formulated for my color-treated hair as well--excellent! TL;DR Really Helpful!"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODV1M4"">Freshen Up Peppermint Flavored Gum (12 count)</a> Extrmely pleased with this product. It was a Christmas gift for my 15 year old Grandaughter,she was delighted!! The package was not damaged and arrived on time promised.I purchased this product before from this seller ,will purchase again without hesitation.annette TL;DR Amazon Verified Purchase"
"When we found out my daughter has celiac disease, we were on the hunt for a reasonable mac&cheese. We tried everything we could fine. This was one of the worst. The cheese flavor was pretty bad. I took one bite and had to spit it out. My daughter didn't like it either. I am keeping a spreadsheet of items we tried so we don't waste our money on it again in the future. The best mac&cheese we found was Annie's rice pasta and cheese. TL;DR Just nasty"
"I've never tried any of these flavored coffee's before so I wasn't sure about this, but decided to take a chance and try it.  And, I'm glad I did.  This coffee is very good.  It tastes wonderful.  And, it smells so good from the bag through the brewing process.  It's a keeper! TL;DR It's a Keeper!"
Great buy for the money. Almonds are large and whole. I am planning to order more almonds plus other nuts from this company. TL;DR ALMONDS GREAT BUY
I SO appreciate Pamela's Co...Offering us Non GMO gluten free products means alot to me and the taste is excellent!....Everyone in my family LOVES all her products including this one.The price is good and i am hoping it stays this way considering all i keep hearing about corn stuff going up on reg products.. TL;DR Wonderful NON GMO Cornbread Mix!!
"I like corn and come from the northeast, where fresh, local corn is a common spring/summer side item, so I'd like to think I know from corn.  I tried a can of Glory's corn over the winter by way of comparison and thought it was pretty tasty.  Good stuff! TL;DR Tasty!"
The supplier did a great job... the coffee was roasted fresh for me and arrived quickly... exactly how I ordered it...and the company was great they sent me and email as soon as they got the order even though he was out of state visiting a coffee farm. The BEST place to buy coffee PERIOD. TL;DR Great Coffee and supplier
This tea is tasty and really helpful for dealing with dietary indiscressions. It's a staple in my household. TL;DR Great Stuff
Even my husband loves them.  Gluten free and flavorful.  Can't beat the price and how easy with the save and subscribe. TL;DR excellent flavor
"My husband's daughter gave me a sampling and I fell in love.  I have both the decaf and caffeinated tea and I just love it.  It is refreshing, wonderful aroma and so good for me. TL;DR Green tea"
"The pieces of pineapple were hard and crunchy. I bit into one piece and part of it was as hard as gravel or an olive pit. I hardly noticed the flavor because the texture was so awful.<br /><br />There is another dried pineapple product brand called Made in Nature that is excellent, so I suggest you buy that instead. Their product is moist and chewy and delicious. TL;DR One of the worst products I've ever bought"
"We live on Sun butter and eat it daily but recently the product has changed and become too hard to spread.  It actually cracks and comes off the side of the package in a glob, it is like a hard cream cheese in texture rather than a nut butter.  I will have to look at another brand of sunflower seed butter. TL;DR too hard to spread"
"Excellent coffee.  Quick receipt of same.  One quick observation, packaging could have been sealed better. TL;DR Excellent coffee."
"Fake bones don't work on all dogs, but this one has kept my 2 year-old yella Lab atomic-chewer entertained for over a month and is still going strong. I'll always keep one on hand. You gotta wonder, though, about the side effects of ingesting all that nyla. TL;DR Great fake bone"
"I have ordered this product in the past. I must say it is excellent. However I am surprised to see the price hike. Once you add shipping, it is just ridiculous. Swiss Miss makes a sugar free hot chocolate mix that can be purchased at Walmart for a fraction of the price. TL;DR Ouch"
"I use Tinkyada spirals the most when making our weekly pasta dinner, they're just so much fun. These work great for pasta dinners or cold pasta salads with lots of veggies and feta.<br /><br />Tinkyada products hold up perfectly to cooking and aren't soggy and mealy like the other gluten free brands out there. This is worth buying and you won't be sorry! TL;DR My favorite"
Tastes fine but has stems in it which better quality Sencha's do not.  They tend to float which my husband dislikes.  We finally solved it by grinding a quantity in the coffee grinder to get it quite fine. TL;DR Stems
"The shipping of this product was very fast. I love this cheese served with port wine, and a pear poached in Burgundy.  Very strong taste. It is hard to find in even high end stores.  I recommend to stock up when you can find it. TL;DR A superior blue cheese"
"As an adult who occasionally enjoys a cookie or two ... or six, I was hoping this new cookie would deliver a satisfying overload of chocolate and texture and become a household staple.  And while I was pleased with some aspects of this particular cookie, it did not meet the standards I was expecting.<br /><br />First of all, if one really wants something named ""Chewy Gooey Megafudge"" to actually taste good, they should skip the calorie counting because, in my opinion, taste has an inverse relationship with calories.  So, nutritional info aside, the overall taste for a mass-packaged soft cookie was quite satisfactory.  I liked the flavor of the chocolate cookie dough in combination with white-chocolate chips and the injected ""fudge"" and although the combination of the three sounds extremely rich, the cookies were not ""heavy"" or overly sweet.  The first cookie easily led to a second ... and then a third, so they did have an addictive quality to them (maybe now caloric intake should be considered).<br /><br />While flavor is important, I predicated my overall satisfaction on other aspects like texture, packaging, value, etc. and I had some issues with the Chewy Gooey Megafudge cookies that generated disappointment:<br /><br />1) Texture - for soft cookies, they crumble too much.  It is frustrating to take a bite and have the remainder of the cookie falling apart around the fudge in the middle.  Additionally, the fudge was not gooey, as promised by the name ... it was more like cake icing.<br />2)  Packaging - for the size of the bag, there are relatively few cookies.  My first disappointment was opening the descent-sized bag of cookies only to find the plastic divider tray consuming most of the space ... and relatively few cookies.<br />3) Cookie Size - this was the biggest turn-off.  An addictive chocolate-chocolate chip cookie with fudge filling ... the size of a half-dollar?  C'mon, cookies like this need to be bigger than bite-sized.<br /><br />The lethal combination of tiny cookies and such small quantity (due to the packaging) was more than enough to negate the taste for me. In fact, I `m not sure a cookie-craving moment could be satisfied by a single bag!  Increasing the size of the cookie and putting more of them into the bag would make this product a staple in my household. TL;DR A Descent Tasting Cookie that Still Disappoints ..."
"Izze is like a freshly made italian soda, but with the convenience of being in a can. It's not super-sugary like a normal fruit-flavored pop and it has a lighter fizz (just the right amount, if you ask me). I tried the Pomegranate flavor, which I would describe more as a tart cherry/pomegranate blend. It has quickly become my beverage of choice when I open up the fridge. It's definitely more of a sparkling fruit juice than what you would think of as ""pop"". I highly recommend it! TL;DR Italian soda in a can"
"Had not heard about this. Read about this in the Chicago Sun Times and had to try it.<br />Had it on pizza last night. Yummy.<br />My son mixed it in with his tuna salad along with a squirt of spicy mustard and it really gave a lot of flavor to his tuna salad sandwich. He said he had it before while visiting his brother.<br />From what I understand, this has been gaining popularity for some time now and I may be late to the party, but if you haven't heard of or tried this and like things hot, give it a go. TL;DR Good Stuff"
i was disapointed in this salt. since it is a truffle salt i expected to taste at least a hint of Truffle but didnt. if you want a really good Truffle flavored salt order Fusion Black Truffle salt it has a wonderfully strong aroma and great flavor! TL;DR truffless
i didn't buy these to eat... i bought them as a centerpiece for a circus themed baby shower.  I filled a large  vase with the gumballs and used on buffet table.  I did try one out of curiousity and they were extremely hard and lost flavor within seconds.  SO... highly recommend for decor purposes.  don't recommend for flavor purposes unless you want a jaw workout. TL;DR gumballs as centerpiece
"I really enjoy this tea and love that it is caffeine free too!  There isn't any other Jasmine Tea that I've found that is also caffeine free.  I can share this with my mother who normally does not like tea, but she enjoys this.  Because of her heart condition she has to stay away from the caffeine so this works out great. TL;DR Wonderful tea!"
works great for the bath salts to make them fizz. arrived quickly and well packaged. TL;DR works great
"I have always been weary of box rices, but I needed something quick. I accidentally bought this (I thought it was yellow rice) and after tasting, loved it. My husband loves this with grilled peppers, onions and grilled chicken. It is on the sweet side but so yummy! The dried pineapples hydrate well and are delicious. TL;DR great product"
"These are not your average anchovy in a can -- these are wonderful!  They truely add flavor to tomato sauce, tomato soup, salad, .... they just melt into the food.  People wonder why my food is better than theirs -- it's probably the addition of these anchovies!  (I even use the olive oil in the bottom of the jar after the anchovies are used up.  Really wonderful!)  They come with a little fork, which makes them easy to remove from the jar, and I have several forks now.  What do you do with them after a while?  They are cheaper from my local store, though.  They do not require refrigeration -- I just keep mine on the counter -- even after it's been opened.  However, I live in the NE, so maybe in the South you might need to be wary of temps. TL;DR Tasty!"
"what a joke, this thing just does not work. my borador thinks it is toy , keeps going into the yard and brings it back.  save your money it doesn't work TL;DR what a joke"
"These chips/popcorn are great! I had them on Jet Blue and looked for them in stores but could not find them, so I turned to Amazon! They are great, especially for people who are not allowed to eat popcorn due to stomach problems. They are a great alternative because they have no kernels. TL;DR Delicious!"
I bought this one because it was the only one that didn't contain chocolate chips and the ingredients did NOT list partially hydrogenated oil unlike the other versions from this brand.  The walnuts are barely noticeable. TL;DR 256 grams of sugar
"But don't take my word for it.  Read those of a serious chocolate lover and reviewer:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I think he's brilliant, but then maybe that's because I agree wholeheartedly with him that Callebaut Bittersweet chocolate is simply the best.  Whether making a ganache for a triple layer devil's food chocolate cake or eating straight (after cutting with a very big knife), nothing else comes close. TL;DR Simply the best."
"these things are really great....they are hot, but good....just reading about them makes me want some more... TL;DR great stuff"
"I chose this in the hopes that it would be a ""different"" type of energy drink.  I have always shied away from them before because of the vitaminy taste that remains after consuming one.  This particular dring tasted of tangerines and did have the vitamin taste but it was not overpowering while drinking it and went down smoothly.  I am an ardent coffee-drinker and have the benefits of drinking coffee to keep me awake works far better than any energy drink.  I was hoping that the No Fear would prove me wrong but, unfortunately I was left with the same aftertaste and little to no energy boost.  I would not recommend it more than I would any other energy drink brand. TL;DR Nothing out of the ordinary"
"The description reads ""Golden yellow color"", but what you get is a deep orange colored peanut oil. The culprit: the beta carotene. I guess this was added for health benefits & eye-candy. The fries were OK, but the smell of the heated oil (not the fries though) made me think of...fried vitamins. My wife really likes (she says the fries are crisp and taste good) but I wouldn't buy it again, so it is a matter of taste. The price was $17 when I got it, since then it jumped to $26. TL;DR Beta Carotene-packed fries"
"Good Seasons Garlic & Herb dressing is the very best salad dressing ever.  Every time I serve it someone will comment on how delicious it is and ""you must give me the recipe,""  It is not carried in most the of super markets in my area so when I see it I buy all they have.  You will always find in my pantry.  Except today, I used my last packet last night and have to go to town to get more.  Hope they have it. TL;DR The best ever"
"I think this tea could do its work, but i never like the test and did not use evena half of the packet. TL;DR Tea-for-Two Pregnancy Tea (one-month supply)"
"I made it according to the directions (2 Tbs PB2 and 1 Tbs water) for a peanut butter and honey sandwich.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  It tasted just like ""real"" peanut butter but without the oily taste.  If you're looking to cut calories and like peanut butter, I don't think you'll miss the oil.  I bought the chocolate too but haven't tried it yet.  It certainly smells the same as the plain PB2. TL;DR Much better than expected."
This is one of my favorite coffees with the bold flavor.  I get up at 4 am for work and need all the help to get going that I can get.  This does the trick. TL;DR Great Morning Wake Up Coffee
"I ordered this based on recommendations from my friend. The corn is sweet and the edamame is tasty, but I am not a big fan of bell peppers. My husband,though, loves the bell peppers, so if you like bell peppers, then you'll<br />probably like the Veggie Medley too! TL;DR healthy mix of veggies, if you like bell peppers"
"Being originally from a latin-american country, coconut water is one of those essential summer week-end drinks that we not only enjoyed as refreshments, but loved for all the no nonsense nutritional information our parents would throw at us about it.<br /><br />And though it's been a while since I've had a real hard shelled coconut spliced open to insert a straw and enjoy, this little pack did its job of refreshing me with that wonderful taste, and make me feel proud of the nutrition I was getting out of it.<br /><br />Packaged in a handy little container, it keeps the product fresh and with all its flavorful attributes.  Delicious, refreshing, nutritious.  It's definitely worth a try, and you long for the real thing but are far from a tropical beach, this might be your best substitute. TL;DR Tastes like the real thing"
"These have such a wonderful taste to them - all kids I've ever given them to just love them, even the picky ones.  If you're an adult, they certainly won't do much to fill you up in the mornings - you'll need a side of eggs or something to go with them, but they do taste great, are a great snack for baseball games, etc., and really help out when you need a toddler snack in a hurry.  Great options, we eat them all the time, and really, they're not just for breakfast!  Recommend! TL;DR Great taste, great fast food breakfast"
"WHILE WATCHING TV, I LOVE A GOOD SNACK TO HELP PASS THE TIME. A GOOD LOW FAT FIG NEWTON WILL HIT THE SPOT. I'VE ALWAYS LOVED FIG NEWTONS IN THE PAST AND STILL DO NOW. WITH A LW FAT VANILLA MILK, AM IN BUSINESS WITH A REMOTE CONTROL IN MY HANDS. TL;DR FIG NEWTONS"
"This was on special so I decided to give it a try and I'm so happy I did!  This tea is not like any I""ve tried before.  It smells delicious and reminds me of a banana split. That sounds strange, but there is no banana taste, just a lovely fruity, vanilla flavor. TL;DR Wonderful!"
"Just so you know, you can usually get this at your local bodega or Mexican grocery store for less than half the price.  I'm like 1500 miles from Mexico and I can still find it locally. TL;DR cheaper locally"
"I will turn 50 this month and I wish I knew about this rice years ago!  It taste great and is great for you, I bought this last week and I am placing another order today!  Thanks to AMAZON and the reviews, I found this!  Michael in San Antonio TL;DR HEALTH.........................."
I really enjoy this coffee - I have used a variety of the K-cups and this is one of the best. TL;DR Great coffee
"I had to come to Amazon to purchase these chips because they are not available to my local area.  It is well worth it!  These are the best chips I have ever had.  If you have any taste for tortilla chips and salsa, these are the chips for you.  You will not be let down! TL;DR Salsitas are incredible!"
"These are absolutely the best protein bars I have ever eaten. I find them particularly awesome because I have to watch my sugar intake as a pre-diabetic, but I also have Celiac disease, so this sugar free, gluten free bar kicks butt! TL;DR Awesome"
"Im very happy I took a chance and ordered this.  There were indeed 70 different cups.  Only two iced which is great because while I love iced coffee, my Keurig doesnt make it.  There was a great balance of flavored lighter roasts and more bold, darker roasts.  There were several from the same brand, like green mountain coffee, but all different flavors.  There were also several brands I have seen before, so that's exciting.  It was packaged very nicely.  Overall I'm very happy and will order again when these are gone. TL;DR Wonderful variety and overall purchase"
"Thinking theres alot of stuff I do not like prepackaged and heated over the stove..I acually like this stuff, and its not all that spicy, if you like things very spicy. Very easy and fast. I was surprised how the taste was. I think that one package is enough for one person. You probably can just add more vegs and it would taste even better! Yea, you just have to try it in order to know. TL;DR Great"
"I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life. TL;DR After a month, I am a believer"
These are the only brand of brandy chocolates to buy...one bite and your are hooked! TL;DR Decadent
I like this cereal as a substitute for popcorn.  I hate getting the little kernel things from popcorn stuck in my gums so this is a wonderful alternative. TL;DR Great snack
"Shipping was fast! The bones are good quality. Some are smaller than others but, they are thick inside. My pitbull loves them! Saved 2/3's by not paying $16-$20 each at pets stores.  Will be buying them here from now on. TL;DR happy about price more than anything"
"I ordered a box of these chocolates as a part of my girlfriend's Christmas present. When they arrived they were a bit battered, but still taste great.<br /><br />I emailed the seller, not for a replacement, but just to say that the chocolates were really good but the packaging left a bit to be desired.<br /><br />The seller over nighted a replacement box to us. Great customer service, and very enjoyable chocolates. I will definitely buy from them again !<br /><br />Thank you ! TL;DR Excellent chocolates, great customer service"
"We replaced white flour with spelt flour in all our flour needs, We started with bread and have moved on to cookies, brownies and homemade pasta. It adapts to our reciepes very well and my husband and i have started to see some weight loss already. We were also very pleased with the packaging and the price was not out of this worldbut very reasonable. We will soon be ordering more . We have been very happy with this product. TL;DR spelt flour"
"I have been using this espresso for over a year in my commercial espresso machine, and have enjoyed the flavor. The Italians do not over roast there beans so you don't get the bitter Starbucks type flavor. The reason Starbucks over roasts their beans is, to hide a poor quality bean, they are about marketing not coffee. I really have to laugh when somebody compares Starbucks to Lavazza. TL;DR nice espresso"
"Disclaimer: I'm a huge tea-drinker and tea-lover! However, I don't like teas that are too bitter or astringent-tasting.<br /><br />Puerh tea (pronounced ""POO-air"") can be either green or black, which is really confusing. This one in particular is a green that tastes like a black! Puerh must be gathered from very old tea plants, which is partly why it tends to be quite expensive. Puerhs are supposed to be very strong-tasting, but this one is relatively mild.<br /><br />This Magnolia Puerh tastes very, very floral, almost like a jasmine, but is also very mild. It steeps up light, so don't over-steep thinking it needs to darken and turn it bitter. (Any tea will bitter if over-steeped due to the tannins.) The mouth-feel is light and silky, and it's very floral and aromatic. I do not agree with the product description that the flavor ""changes with every sip"", but it does take on a very faint citrusy flavor if you let it sit for 10 minutes before drinking. It is only enhanced by honey and milk.<br /><br />If you like Jasmine tea, you would be very likely to enjoy Numi's Magnolia Puerh tea. It's also a good choice for someone who loves black and floral, and wants to gradually ease into drinking more greens. TL;DR Green tea that tastes like black tea!"
I had a hard time finding Passion Fruit Tea Bags at the store. I used the tea bags to make Iced tea and it was really good. I look forward to ordering more flavors from this brand. TL;DR Great flavor
"I'm an avid fan of the B.B. honey sweet mustard and the B.B. hot mustard. I ordered a case of this mustard thinking it would be as great as the others and because we often times mix the honey sweet mustard with cranberry sauce.  Quite honestly, neither my husband nor I care for this product much.  I can't explain exactly why but we just don't care for the taste.  I'm thinking I might use it for marinades and spice it up a bit or use it for glazes.  But as a garnish for meats or veggies it just doesn't make the mustard. TL;DR Doesn't make the mustard"
"I have tried all of the GF pastas out there.  I am very sensitive to corn, can't do quinoa, brown rice bran bugs the heck out of me and I found this lovely lite pasta once day and I LOVE it!  I now subscribe order it from Amazon. TL;DR Love it!"
"I'm very happy with this green tea powder, although I have never used any other.  It is a rich color and flavor.<br />I use it to mix in with my greek yogurt. TL;DR Excellent quality"
These are great for poking in the big Kong because they take some work for the pups to get them out. I like that the packaging is all recyclable and it keeps them fresh. TL;DR Nice and yummy
"When i received the baby food i had to try it before giving it to my daughters sister..It actually tastes pretty darn good.The consistency is like apple sauce.Its in a foil type pouch and has a spout that has a cap on it.You can warm it or serve it cold,or room temperature.After opening it you need to refridgerate it.You remove the cap and put the tip of it in the babys mouth and squeeze a little into his or her mouth.Its a wonderful design and cleanup is a breeze.I think any mother would love the product and i recommend it highly. TL;DR Tastes great"""""
I absolutly love this tea! Out of all the teas i drink this is def my go to tea. Tastes and smells amazing and very comforting after a long stressful day. Will continue to buy this tea as long as i can find it on amazon. Thanks! TL;DR My all time favorite
My kids love these suckers and I bought them to give away at a home show my company was involved in. Some people even came back to get another because they are so good! TL;DR yum!
"We have been feeding our dogs Eagle Pack Dog food for years and have healthier dogs by offering them this in the AM and then follow with a raw ground red meat and cooked oatmeal for thir main evening meal. Eagle Pack is the only way to go when it comes to Dog Food.  Thanks, Paul, Melbourne Florida TL;DR Best Dog Food"
I really wanted Tetley's *British Blend* decaffeinated tea but this is not available by subscription.  Tetley's Decaffeinated Tea is a good compromise: makes a decent cup of tea but shouldn't keep you awake at night. TL;DR Good tea
Very expensive but it's my favorite ever peach tea and hadn't been able to find it for a long time.  Has the best flavor of any peach tea.  Recently found Pickwick Peach Tea and it's pretty good too. TL;DR Expensive but hard to get favorite item
I have enjoyed many different brands of crystalized ginger over the years.  Ths product has a little too much sugar for me but I just rinse it off before eating it.  The ginger itself is wonderful.  It is not too strong and not weak in flavour.<br />A great product. TL;DR product with bite
"As soon as I opened the packaging the box fell apart at the seams. Literally. I just needed a box to keep my brand of tea in my office, so I bought this one thinking I will give away the contents and keep the box, wasn't worth the effort. TL;DR Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!"
"It is so wonderful to have access to chewing gum that doesn't use NutraSweet®/aspartame that it is hard to complain about this gum at all. Even so, there isn't much to complain about. The gum tastes good (if you like Juicy Fruit), and it stays chewable for a couple hours. The only problem is the flavor doesn't last long - maybe a few minutes. I can live with that. TL;DR Tastes like Juicy Fruit. Flavor goes quick, but stays chewable."
"I love anything made with cashews.  These cookies use to have a lot more 'whole sized' cashews which I really loved but now they are more homogenous.  They still have a great buttery, nutty flavor.  I don't buy them often though since they are high in calories and non-healthful ingredients.  A splurge now and then is terrific though since these cookies taste so heavenly.  I do recommend them... though in moderation.  Enjoy! TL;DR Delicious!"
"This soup is better than any I've ever made from scratch, and is incredibly economical.  I used left over rotisserie chicken, added a can of black beans, a can of white shoe peg corn, and a package of frozen cream style corn to the soup to make it more robust and topped my bowl off with shredded cheddar and a small dab of sour cream.  YUMMMM!  I'm back for more and to try other products by Frontier. TL;DR More Please!"
"Am very limited in what I can eat, and this product is a definite keeper. Is easily and very quickly prepared. Left-overs store very nicely, and this is yet another  product I cannot find where I live, so am doubly grateful that Amazon carries this. TL;DR LOVE IT!!"
"First tried it on my deployment. Some locals recommended it to me, and I've been hooked ever since. A must try for coffee lovers. TL;DR Great Coffee"
"Celestial Seasonings Sweet Harvest Pumpkin<br />Price I Paid: >$4/1 box(Free shipping due to amazon add-on)<br /><br />Caff-O-Meter: 30mg according to website<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Black Tea, Cinnamon, Ginger, Roasted Chicory, Natural Pumpkin Flavor With Other Natural Flavors (Soy Lecithin), Luo Han Guo, Cloves, Nutmeg, Natural Sweetener (Stevia Extract) and Pumpkin.<br /><br />This is the first time I have ever heard of Luo Han Guo, it is another (low/no cal) sweetener that appears to have been in use in the Asian province for years (what else are they hiding from us!). I would recommend taking some time to research it if you're interested, it makes many claims of benefits, but I am not informed enough to say whether or not they are true. Either way the use of this ingredient would not sway my purchase one way or the other unless the alternative was extremely high in g of sugar or made with the sweeteners known to cause issues.<br /><br />-Smell(5) - Amazing smell! This is my favorite smelling tea thus far, the reminiscent of fall is definitely in there, closely reminds me of Sweet potatoes when cooked and prepared but stronger.<br /><br />-Taste<br />+*Unsweetened:<br />*I prefer my teas Iced and 1 cup to .5 packet of sweetener. So unless it wows me, without sweetener will always be lower in points so to compensate I (usually)add .5 points to the unsweetened taste average. However the sweetness in this stands out on its own as it contains sweetener extract therefore I am not going to give it the typical .5 compensation.<br />  Hot (5) - I have never come across a tea with such a naturally sweet flavor to it (likely attributed to the 2 natural sweeteners). I would be happy just drinking this hot with no sweetener (Iced is my preferred tea). Vanilla is the flavor that is standing out to me the most which is odd because its not listed, unless its under one of the natural flavors.<br />  Iced (4.5) - slightly thinner taste, this is likely attributed to the melting of the ice when I poured it over. The flavor is still sweet and taste is good I could easily drink this with no sweetener.<br /><br />+Sweetened<br />  Hot (4)- Adding the sweetener (1 pkg of truvia) almost makes it to sweet for me but the flavor is still there and it is still good. It definitely makes the artificial sweetener stand out.<br />  Iced (5) - WOW! Perfect! Gets me right in the mood for fall, so far this is the best tea I have ever had (flavored at least)<br /><br />-2nd Steep - (4) it weakens a little bit on the flavor but it still makes a great cup of tea, I didn't have try a 3rd steep but I would assume you could stretch it out to 3 maybe more. I did not deduct from this however because for a 2nd steep to still have as much flavor as it did is impressive<br /><br />Summary - A solid 5 star tea, This tea is possibly the best tea I have ever had, I would precaution you that I do like my items on the sweeter side, and this had the sweetness naturally (read above on Luo Han Guo). Some of you may find this too sweet or ""fake"" sweet, it appears the sweeteners are natural though from my limited research.<br /><br />If you must have some pumpkin tea now, here is a decent method to get you by (don't expect a miracle of flavor). Pumpkin pie spice (I prefer 1 tsp per 16 oz water) ""steep"" it for 5 minutes hot water then add your preferred tea for a normal steep time. Strain/Sweeten to preference. I use plain lipton loose leaf for now but I can't wait to try this with plain rooibos when I get it.<br /><br /> I have many other teas for fall to try, so keep checking back. To get a better idea of whether or not we have similar tastes in teas check out my profile (I used to actually hate tea). And yes, I may have too much time on my hands. TL;DR My Favorite Autumn (or any) tea thus far !!"
"I have loved these from the beginning when they were delfa rolls and then danish ribbons. I was devastated when they were nolonger available and could not wait to try the ""new formula"" because they are not the same and they have a more artificial manufactured strawberry flavor. I searched for their return online since I am a fan along with my sister and husband and we adopted the new taste and it grows on you and becomes oddly addicting with the same texture that you love to unroll. TL;DR Not the same but still strangely addicting"
The carmel corn was stale; everything else was average.  Not worth the $30 I paid. It's like the size of something you would get in a mini-bar. TL;DR It's like the size of something you would get in a mini-bar.
Don't get me wrong. I love Intelligensia coffee... I buy it a lot living in the L.A. area.<br />But this stuff is just straight up not fresh. I may be a little bit more picky than your average coffee drinker since I usually always buy fresh and definitely always grind the beans at home. But there is a noticeable difference between buying from Amazon and buying from the store itself. TL;DR Not Fresh
"This is the third different type I've tried(Schnucks and Hapi).  They are very good, but a little crunchier/harder than the others I've had. That is the only dislike.  The hottest wasabi, but still manageable.  I like the Hapi brand a little better since they are not as hard, but these are a little cheaper so they are both great. TL;DR Very good and hottest wasabi so far"
"I just tried this--love the taste but hated all of the hard seeds from the flax.I have false teeth and it was impossible to eat without them getting stuck everywhere. Probably great for youngsters who like chunky things, but not for me.I wish they had ground up the flaxseeds--then it would have been perfect! TL;DR good taste but the flax is too crunchy"
"I spotted this exquisite treat at a local gourmet food store and had to give them a try. Excellent flavor and texture, quite unique. And now I can't find them locally anymore, so glad to see them here.<br /><br />St. Dalfour raisins and cranberries are completely different from those which are packed dry. These are moist! And tender and truly delightful. The ingredients listed on the label are: ""raisins, cranberries and 'a touch of sugar.'"" No preservatives (other than the sugar, of course).<br /><br />These raisins and cranberries are vacuum packed in glass jars and remain moist and plump. I don't know how St. Dalfour achieves this, but the resulting product is simply delectable.<br /><br />A tasty treat right off the jar, but even better in desserts (ricotta torte, clafouti, bread pudding).<br /><br />Made in France. TL;DR Moist, plump, exquisite"
"This soup has a lot of taste and is great comfort food.  When giving it to people as a gift, no one ever thinks it is from a kit because it has such interesting taste. TL;DR Everyone thinks I am a superb cook but it's this"
"Not only does this pack contain the regular varieties you can find at any broken down liquor store (like the one in the horror movies) and nothing else, but they package them FOR YOU.  Now, this is all well and good IF you're going to give a deal on them, which they do not.  3 packages for a buck? Please.  I'll limit my choices for a good price, or pay a good price for the freedom to choose, but I won't take a hit on both. And where are all the hard to find flavors? Koolaid is packaging these things all wrong.  Now, lemon-lime flavor happens to be my favorite.  So, I come on here looking to spend maybe 7 or so dollars for a bunch of them, BUT NO!  Look at the way these high-way robbers priced and packaged the things! There's no way in heck I'm about to spend 24 bucks for lemon-flavor AND be forced to spend a year drinking the same flavor.  It'll ruin my affection for the flavor and make me cranky.  The wife doesn't like it when I'm cranky.  I'm not married, but if I was, I'd be cranky and the wife wouldn't like it.  She'd probably divorce me for spending 24 bucks on one flavor of koolaid.  She'd say she needed more variety and didn't want to pay the high-price for it.  In summation....it's friggin powder and flavor, for crying out loud. Give us a break. TL;DR Variety too limited and the price is ridiculous"
"I expected this to super sweet, like Kool-Aid usually is, but was pleasantly surprised by it's flavor.  It's a lighter flavor than other Kool-Aids, very tasty.  My son (who is 6), did not like it, but the adults in the house did. TL;DR Very nice, subtle flavor"
We use the Sport Beans all the time for a quick pick me up when cycling.  They help with your energy levels and are a good compliment to sport drinks.  The cherry flavor is our favorite. TL;DR A must for family cycling tours.
You should get this in any Indian grocery.. The shipping cost sucks in this buy.. Coffee itself has great taste.. just boil milk and mix the powder with suger.. tastes heavenly if made in the right proportions.. I used to have it regularly when I was in India and I continue the same in US too.. TL;DR Wonderful coffee
Everyone who tastes these just love them.  So fruity and natural tasting.  This is a great product! TL;DR These taste so good!!
"We were told by our local veterinary to feed our new puppy this food so we tried it to see if it would agree with her. Some foods we tried gave her very loose stools, which makes it a little harder to potty train when they can't control their bowels. Within 12 hours of starting her on this food her stools firmed up and has been normal ever since, and she seems to be growing well on it also. The Vet said she was in perfect shape for her age, but we only feed about 3/4 of what the bag recommends. Like the Vet said they are selling dog food, and most brands recommend to much food on their bag. TL;DR Puppy loves it"
"My puppy really loves this toy. I'm surprised to see all the negative reviews.<br /><br />I'd call him a heavy chewer, but he has not ripped the bone apart, and we've had it for a few weeks. He's little though (4 months old, 5.5 lbs) so maybe that's why.<br /><br />It's true that the bone doesn't stay frozen for very long. He likes it even after it's begun to thaw, though. He likes it when it's frozen, and he likes it when it's not frozen but cold and wet.<br /><br />Also, to the person who complained that the plastic bag broke: it's just a Ziploc bag. They're not supposed to last forever, and you can easily get another one.<br /><br />Many of the reviewers on here suggested using a frozen washcloth instead. I'm hesitant to do that because I don't want him to learn that it's ok to chew on towels.<br /><br />Bottom line: my puppy loves this toy, so I do too. TL;DR My puppy LOVES this toy"
Just what I expected! Really cute and it arrived on time. It was packaged well so there was no damages. TL;DR Great!
"I love both ginger and pu-erh, so I had high hopes for this tea. It exceeded them. This is a fair-trade tea made by a minority community in China from very ancient tea trees, and it's simply delightful. The mellow earthiness of the pu-erh is complimented by the spicy ginger. A wee bit of citrus fills out the background. Simply gorgeous. An olfactory and gustatory delight. TL;DR Sensational"
I had gotten tired of the Redbulls and 5 Hour Energys of the world and thought I'd try something new. I'm a big fan of anything pomegranate flavored and my dad (who rides 50-70 miles a week) said these made a big difference for him. The flavor is great but I haven't noticed any sort of energy pick up after eating them. I've since switched to Sambozan Acai energy drinks and those are a huge improvement. TL;DR Not so sure about these...
excellet and clean tasting tea.  very natural and not artificial tasting.  will continue to buy. TL;DR awesome tea
great product super pump but don't put it in the refrigerator!  gets too thick to pump TL;DR good but!
I take these for lunch frequently.  Some lettuce and crackers make it feel like a meal but I keep a few in the desk drawer in case I have to work through supper or forget lunch.  They're not terribly fishy but you should really wash out the can before you throw it away in consideration of your co-workers.<br />  We also eat rice and vegetables with a something for protein at home a lot and this is very nice to flavor the rice. TL;DR Great single serving to take to work.
"So happy to have found this product. I need to seriously eliminate salt and sodium from my diet and unlike all the other ""no salt"" seasonings on the market, this one adds good flavor and exceptional taste to everything WITHOUT the potassium that the others use in place of sodium.  The potassium is just as dangerous for my fragile kidney as the sodium.  Thanks Chef Prudomme! TL;DR Fills special need!"
"I teach German and make funnel cakes with all my 6th grade students (about 175 each year.)  I used to do it the ""old fashioned"" way by covering the spout of a funnel with a finger and then pouring it. This was a MESS!  This pitcher makes it so much quicker, cleaner and easier!  I don't use the ring because it is pretty unnecessary in my opinion (plus it scratches non-stick Teflon off of pan.)  I also haven't yet used the mix because we make our own from scratch.  So I guess I'm just reviewing the pitcher, but it works GREAT!  Because the kids have more control over movement, they really can get creative with their cakes.<br /><br />The one con is that it is made of plastic, so I'm worried that one day I'll have a meltdown with either the bottom being set too close to the burner or the funnel tip going in the hot oil, but so far, so good.  This is great fun for everyone and my students LOVE it!<br /><br />A few tips:<br /><br />Add some cinnamon and almond extract--yum!<br />Flip using metal tongs--not a spatula--for less splatter and mess.<br />Plan to make several at a time--they are cheap to make, but the oil can be pricey. TL;DR Great little funnel pitcher!"
Good replacement for meat. I wanted a vegetable protein to combine with meat so that my family eat less meat everyday but get enough protein. I am satisfied with my choice. It is very easy to use and gets taste of your meal. TL;DR I like it
"I just love starting my day with this cereal. It has high fiber, protein and tastes great. Tough to beat if you are looking for a healthy breakfast. TL;DR Great Cereal"
"I've been making homemade playdough and the colors I was using was not vibrant.  These are great for the playdough and using for all types of cooking (fondant, icings, etc.).  I love them and will continue to use them. TL;DR Love the colors and vibrancy"
"This tea is SOOOOOO DELICIOUS!! I love tasting & trying different types of tea & this is, by far, the best tasting Peppermint Tea that I've ever had!! I definitely will keep purchasing this tea (hopefully price won't increase like everything else!)!! Thank you Amazon.com for the great free shipping too! TL;DR Delicious Tea!!"
"I am writing this to inform you, and save you the headache. Like the others, I saw this 25-pack of snozzles at a price too good to be true, and naively purchased them immediately for my dogs. They were listed and sold by PetCo. When they came, I got one huge box, containing a lot of stuffing paper, and a single tiny snozzle....joke was on me it seems.<br /><br />After this, PetCo emailed me a generic message saying there was a discrepancy with the item listing, and they sent me the wrong amount. I emailed PetCo and never received a response. I checked their seller profile, and found a gigantic archive of negative seller ratings, many of them specifically related to the same issue I was experiencing. I then emailed them a few more times. I'm not surprised they never answered a single one of them. Probably too backed up with hundreds of other emails like mine.<br /><br />I never did get my other 24 snozzles, although they refunded me, probably because I kept emailing them. I gave my dog the single snozzle we got, and they did not even want it. I examined it, and it has a chemical smell to it, and looks old. It is quite unfair how someone does this, and can just get away with it, and one does not even get a personal apology.<br /><br />I have decided to join a few others in going to the Better Business Bureau about this. Hope you decide to join in too. TL;DR This product does not exist."
"This popcorn tastes great and is comparable to the Great American brand. Even better it uses healthier sunflower oil and not coconut oil. As to the other reviews that state it's too salty, you can find the same type of reviews with many of these pre-measured packets. The good thing about this brand (as well as several others) the ingredients are separated, so you can adjust to your own taste. I don't like very much salt on my popcorn so I use 1/4 to 1/2 of the salt packet. If others are over that like saltier popcorn I get mine, and then sprinkle some more on the rest. As for reviews saying the popcorn is ""chewy"" I belive that's more the timing of heating the oil & the quality of the machine. I've done multiple taste tests with guests (as we have tried several pre-packaged brands) and this wins more frequently than others. But for me the clincher is the sunflower oil. If you want a great visual effect, put some coconut oil based mixture and sunflower oil based mixture in two clear jars and store a little below room temperature -- around 60 degrees. You'll find a solid block of oil with the cococut mixture, while the sunflower oil mixture is still liquid & see through. Not exactly what I want stuck in my arteries. TL;DR Great tasting healthy alternative to coconut oil"
"I received my peppermint leaves today. Each bag measures about 15 inches tall and 12 inches wide. They come in foil bags that are not resealable. No problem ! I just transferred it to a one gallon Ziploc bags. I had to use 2 Ziploc bags for one pound of the leaves. The leaves are crushed up real fine and sort of resembles tobacco. The aroma alone is to kill for. The taste is excellent. I made tea from the leaves in my coffee pot. I added about 3 tablespoons of the leaves in the coffee maker,poured a cup, and added a teaspoon of sugar. I have a sore throat today and I could feel the coolness of the peppermint in my throat. I have sinus problems and this defiantly helped. The price is great for the amount of peppermint leaves that are received.I will be ordering more to stay stocked up for winter. This would taste excellent in a cup of cocoa on a cold winter night. TL;DR Great taste, Great aroma, Great price"
"This tea works, when I need a good night's rest.  It also has a comforting blend of herbs and flavors that has a calming effect on me, helping me relax enough to sit down and watch a whole movie in the evening without ""wiggling my feet"" or getting up and down constantly :o) TL;DR get some rest!"
"It's ok but not amazing. The Four Cheese is much better than the Original Cheddar but it's still kind of dry and a lot of extra work. If you want a really good baked mac and cheese without doing all the work, get the Kraft Deluxe and top with shredded cheddar and panko. TL;DR Just OK"
"My Apricot Amaretto tea I make by the pot . Next I let it cool down and into the fridge it goes . This tea is a delightful cold drink as well as hot .  What can I say , "" I love Tea Forte . TL;DR Love By The Pot !"
"I was so exicted about this product when I found it on line and bought it with my new Coffee maker, then over the next weekend saw the EXACT same product in Bed, Bath and Beyond for $20 cheaper.  And when mine came in it was missing the Hot Chocolate.  I have never been disappointed in AMAZON before, but I really will look at my purchases MUCH more in the future. TL;DR Disappointed with OVERPRICE of product"
"I like Honey Maid graham crackers, but I don't see much reason for this new packaging of a familiar product.  It's the same graham cracker they have always had, just one cracker instead of the usual two (that you can split apart as they have a line in the middle).  I guess it might be slightly more convenient to have the single cracker, but to me it is a kind of waste (if it ain't broke, don't fix it).  When you figure the price in, the regular double cracker is cheaper; to me this is a no brainer (same product, lesser price by buying the original). TL;DR A half honey graham cracker is still a honey graham cracker"
"This kit has everything you need to make a delicious curry dish. Although it is labeled for beef, we used chicken and it was quite good. The flavor is strong, spicy and a little sweet. Everything you need is in the box. You simply brown your beef (or chicken, lamb, whatever) and add the two packets (one is a dried coconut mix and the other is the spices mix) and finish cooking your meat. This could also be done in a crockpot. The total prep time was less than 20 minutes. The only thing I did not like were the large leaves in the spice mix. I also don't really like the smell of curry and it does linger. TL;DR Excellent, easy to prepare"
We've originally bought this as our dog's first food and then switched to Wellness. Dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to Newman's own and now our dog feels a lot better. Never switched his food ever again. TL;DR Our shiba inu loves this!
"Trivedi water is truly life enhancing and very satisfying.  It has me feeling hydrated and energized at a cellular level. So happy to be able to provide this special water for the well-being of my family, pets and plants as well. TL;DR Life enhancing!"
Ate this piled on yogurt whilst in Greece for breakie every morning when we were on holiday in Greece.<br />I was a hasppy person when I spotted it in Greek yogurt(Fege)along sidea little side pocket at Whole Foods. TL;DR Honey made by God's bees
"Product was distilled water so it was fine, but it took almost a month to arrive.  Will<br />not purchase from this supplier ever again. TL;DR Terrible shipping time"
"This tree is absolutely gorgeous, the only thing that it come in a blue ceramic pot instead of the brown same shape...other wise as it shows in the picture. I like my Bonsai tree. TL;DR NICE BONSAI TREE"
If you want to get these items cheaper...I saw them at Sprouts and Whole foods if there is one close by.. =) TL;DR Welll....
"This wine turned out fantastic!  Everyone who has tried it has absolutely adored it.  The labels, however, are a different story.<br /><br />The word Zinfandel is missing the first N.  The label says Blackberry Zifandel.  How embarassing!  Not to mention that they are a mustard yellow and not the nicest looking.<br /><br />Again, GREAT wine, weak labels. TL;DR Great wine, weak labels"
"This is a godsend for diabetics, low glycemic and is great for baking or anything else you want to use it for. TL;DR Low Glycemic"
"I'll admit I bought these for the jar. They were on sale for $1 at the local supermarket, and I thought the jars would make nice candles.<br /><br />Tried eating one. Awful chemical kind of taste to the syrup. Threw away the pears. TL;DR Terrible."
"Have been making our homemade yogurt for decades and the reason I use this starter is even though I remove 1/4 cup of the batch I have made for the next batch, after a few months its good to have a fresh culture starter.  So every 3-4 months after having made literally gallons of homemade yogurt I will open one of the sealed packets of starter culture and start a new fresh batch of yogurt.  But we make a gallon of yogurt per week, because we eat yogurt with a half teaspoon of cinnamon in the morning, and make yogurt cheese for both cheesecake and for mixing with herbs for our own yogurt cream cheese with crackers or on bagels.<br /><br />If you eat little yogurt you could simply buy a small cup of store bought plain yogurt and use that for starter, but you also have to make sure the store bought stuff has no milk from cows that have received hormones or antibiotics. Something we avoid by only using organic raw milk. TL;DR Have used this brand for a dozen or more years..here is why"
"My 10 month old loves these. I've tried the Veggie Dip as well as the Garden Tomato. Actually, my hubby loves them too so I find myself running out pretty quickly!<br /><br />I love the fact that these are tasty, healthy, provide teething relief since they are crunchy, yet soft enough for our (as yet) toothless baby to ""chew"", melt in her mouth pretty quickly so there's no choking hazard, and are easy for baby to pick up with her own hand. Sometimes when my daughter is in a fussy mood and wont eat anything else, I put some of these in front of her and while she's concentrating on feeding herself, I sneak in a few spoonfuls of food. Very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend. TL;DR good flavor, perfect crunchy texture"
"These are a little different than your average ramen noodle. They still contain the artery-clogging amounts of fat (they are FRIED in palm oil, after all,) the high sodium and the whopping 380 calories per pack.<br /><br />However, these are Taiwanese-style noodles, which are a little thinner and have somewhat more flavor - good enough to eat dry. They also contain two packets of seasoning. One of sesame oil, and one of chicken flavor with sesame seeds. In all, a hard on the body but oh-so-tasty edible. Just don't eat them for every meal! TL;DR Yummy!"
"the house favorite<br />no tea bagged chais will ever compare.<br />nice flavors in my mouth. the ingredients work perfect.<br />i do taste coconut. the orange peel takes it to another level.<br />excellent/YUM<br />we drink it hot or iced with condensed milk or half and half and sweetened.<br /><br />some of my favorites:<br />numi organic chamomile lemon/loose/excellent<br />coffee bean direct here at amazon:<br />jasmine/mixed with their orange pekoe<br />earl grey/mixed with their orange pekoe/or twinings english breakfast<br />orange pekoe<br /><br />adagio teas loose/all are very good<br />chocolate chai<br />thai chai(has coconut too)<br />masala thai<br />spiced apple chai<br />honeybush apricot<br /><br />tin of Sunflower jasmine tea i buy at local asian market/mix with any black tea/very good<br />tea was about 6.00/lb<br /><br />twinings:<br />direct from england twinings usa online/black 500gr tins<br />english breakfast<br />earl grey<br /><br />good quick tea bag<br />lipton vanilla caramel truffle...yummy 5-6 oz water per bag<br />lipton bavarian wild berry/good 5-6 oz water per bag<br />stash chamomile nights/very nice<br />stash lemon blossom/very nice/don't use milk/curdles<br />bigelow chamomile mango/i like it iced<br /><br />product ingredients coconut chai:<br />Indian black tea, organic cinnamon, ginger, cardamom pods, whole cloves, orange peels, nutmeg, org. black pepper, organic cinnamon essential oil, organic coconut flavor TL;DR favorite chai"
These rawhide rolls are great. What I have a hard time finding is a roll that will last longer than an hour with my dog. These actually took my dog all day to finish. TL;DR Long lasting
Got a free sample from Quaker's FB page...ate the whole box without milk!  They are just the perfect sweetness with the great crunch of oatmeal.  Lots of fiber to fill you up w/ far fewer calories than other cereals or snacks.  I recommend them highly. TL;DR Ate whole sample box with no milk! Delicious
"Organic and Gluten free and it tastes good, can't get much better than that. They are sweet so I think kids would like them as well, but not so sweet as you feel like your eating a kids cereal. TL;DR Great organic and gluten free cereal"
"The poppers are the favorite of my dog and her friends.  At the end of every long walk, I give them three poppers each.  They always behave well when they know a popper is coming. TL;DR My dog's favorite training treat"
"If you appreciate good chocolate flavor, buy the vanilla flavor of this item.  The vanilla is pretty good, the chocolate fails the flavor test.  In short, no flavor. TL;DR Labrada Nutrition Lean Body Pro V 60 Chocolate Ice Cream flavor review"
"i love the product this is the fourth time I've re-ordered. I like my coffee iced, even in winter! TL;DR i love the product this is the fourth time i've re-ordered"
Have been purchasing this granola at the health food shop until I saw it on Amazon for a much lower price. The only true gluten free granola that doesn't make you feel diet restricted. My whole family sprinkles it on their yogurt and pudding and ice cream as toppings. I use it for apple cobbler. Can't seem to keep it in the house very long.  A perfect gluten free product for traveling.  MMmmm!!!!!!!!!!! TL;DR Perfect for the crunchies
Exactly as advertised. Plenty of space to set the Keurig brewer on top and still fit under a counter top (depending on counter top height). Cups fir in nicely and the drawer is easy to access and see what K-Cups you may want. TL;DR K-Cup Holder
"London Cuppa is the best tea I have tried.  I am not a coffee drinker but I love tea.  I have tried a lot of different breakfast type black teas and London Cuppa is by far the best.  It is my daily morning hot beverage.  Not only does it make great hot tea but it is just as good, if not better, as an iced tea.  I cannot buy London Cuppa in stores locally so I have to order it online.  Being able to get it through Amazon now makes it even easier for me to get my favorite tea.  Try London Cuppa you'll love it. TL;DR Best tea ever"
"A couple of years ago I found some little gray babies while cleaning out the boat for the season.  They weren't even two weeks old. At the time I was just breaking in a new puppy and feeding him Innova dog food.  I have followed suit with the kitties with awesome results.  For one, everyone asks if my boys are Prussian Blues.  Now I'm not much of a snob when it comes to animals (mostly saved strays when we were children) but apparently my little rescues resemble some elitist thorough-breds!  They're coats are nothing short of spectacular.  Smooth, sleek, shiny.  I attribute all of this and the rest of their excellent health to the food they eat.  They're also extremely athletic.  Most cats are, I know, but I have grown up with cats for my entire life and I can say of the multitude of cats I been around and helped take care of these guys are ninjas!  I also give a large amount of that credit to the food that they eat.  Most folks probably are reluctant to try feeding their animals the ""healthy"" food because their little friends might not like the taste.  Not to worry, because it seems my ninja boys can't get enough of this food.  I have to measure out what I feed them so they don't gorge themselves to the bursting point.  They would eat this all day if they were allowed.  Wouldn't imagine this to be the case if it didn't taste well.  Needless to say I am keeping the boys on this regiment.  They have responded beyond my expectations on this diet! TL;DR Watch out for my Ninja Kitties!!!"
"The only thing stopping me from rating this as a 5 is the quality of the teapot itself is slightly lacking.  Mine arrived chipped and the lid doesn't sit very well which makes pouring it a bit difficult, but for the price it's hard to argue.<br /><br />After I've brewed each tea flower about 4 times, I will re-fill the teapot with cold water, and this works as a centerpiece on my counter for about a week!  Guests will notice and ask about the teapot, at which time I empty out the old flower, and voila! Instant entertainment and a great cup of tea.  I also feel better about the price of the tea flowers knowing that I have ended up with over two months worth of enjoyment of looking at the blossoms.<br /><br />The tea itself is pretty decent.  I liked the jasmine green the best, but was pleasantly surprised by the rose flavored one.<br /><br />This is definitely not recommended for your daily cuppa' because of the increased price, but it makes for a great pot to share with a friend. TL;DR Drink and a Conversation Piece"
"I have this on subscribe and save. It takes a little bit more work than an Aunt Jemima or Bisquick as you have to add eggs, butter and milk to the mix but it's well worth it. This makes the best pancakes and waffles i've ever had.<br /><br />I've also used this in the Ihop egg trick (mixing pancake mix into omlettes to make them easier to make and more fluffy) and it's AMAZING. I don't eat any other pancake unless I don't have an option. TL;DR Delicious"
Decicious rice cakes! They don't fall apart like the others. They are whole grain and gluten free! Goes great with peanut butter or jelly! TL;DR Awesome!
"My husband and I love this stuff, and this is by far the cheapest price we have found for this brand.  It cooks up fast and is easy to season to our tastes. TL;DR Tasty and a great price"
My Salad has three toppings This OIL and THERE Balsamic with CRACKED Pepper.... all a Salad & a girl watching her waistline NEED! TL;DR If it is Martinis I am a fan.....
"We used these crumbs to make pie crusts for Thanksgiving.  The results were excellent!  Taste and texture were just like regular graham cracker crumbs.  We were able to make 2 no-bake crusts from one box, making them cost-effective as well. TL;DR Worked great in regular recipes"
This stuff has great packaging. The product has barely and flavor at all. It is like drinking watered down Swiss MIss hot coco. I don't recommend it. TL;DR Where's the flavor
"This is a very smooth, aromatic coffee, with low acidity. It doesn't leave a strong aftertaste, nor kick your stomach when you drink it, just the opposite. This coffe was recommended to us almost 2 years ago, and since then has been our favorite. TL;DR One of the best coffee you will ever have"
Ordered from LA Zen for my sister. She got the item...and a hand written / drawn note with puppies singing about how wonderful she was. Complete with stickers and doodles across the package.<br /><br />Made our week. I'm ordering everything from LA Zen for the rest of my ecommerce life. Seriously obsessed. TL;DR LA Zen is the best ever.
"I agree with everything the previous two reviews have said.<br /><br />One of my cats has stomatitis - her teeth and gums are chronically inflamed, making it difficult for her to eat most canned foods (since most canned cat foods are mushy and stick to her teeth like peanut butter). The texture of this cat food is different - it comes in little shreds or strips, making it much easier for her to eat because nothing gets stuck to her painful, painful mouth.<br /><br />Also, the manufacturers will send you detailed nutrition information (down to the exact calories and milligrams) if you email them!<br /><br />Sidenote - all but maybe one or two of TikiCat's varieties are very low in phosphorus, making them super awesome for cats with kidney issues. TL;DR Awesome cat food"
"These bags are great! They are light, fit lots of things and the way they fold is very well thought. If you put them in your purse, it's like they are not even there.<br /><br />The only drawback is the paint (of the outside ""drawings"") that starts to fade. Other than that, they are really really good! TL;DR Recommend"
I knew I had to do something to get away from my diet coke habit; the artificial sweetener was causing health issues for me.  Zevia was recommended to me so I tried it.  The best change I ever made!  I am a Zevia drinker now and there is no turning back! (Ordering from Amazon and having it delivered to my door is a big plus too!) TL;DR Love it!
"As others have noted, this thing is huge.  If your dog likes it, it could be a good investment, because it's clearly indestructible and could last forever.  It has great ridges and shapes, things dogs usually like to chew on.  So why three stars?  My dogs don't chew it.  I have three dogs and one foster dog, of different sizes and breeds, so I'm surprised that not one of them likes it.  Especially since they loved deer antlers, which I stopped giving them because I had problems with splintering.  One dog - who will chew anything - nibbled on the edges a few times to get at the ""marrow,"" but gave that up when it was clear that there was only so much marrow you could get.<br /><br />This seems like a good product IF your dog likes it, but in my house, four dogs say ""meh."" $30 down the drain. TL;DR Nice antler, my dogs aren't interested"
"Fruit Roll-Ups Simply Fruit rolls are a convenient, tasty snack, that is made with mostly natural ingredients.  The main ingredients are pear, apple, strawberry, and blackberry juice concentrates and purees.  Less than 2% of the product is made using preservatives or additives.<br /><br />The rolls are sweet but also a bit tangy.  They are a smooth, flexible consistency and aren't sticky to the touch, even when they get hot.<br /><br />The sugar content is a bit high at 10 grams per roll, but they contain only 50 calories each.<br /><br />All in all... a quick, healthy, and tasty snack. TL;DR Very tasty, and mostly all natural."
"When made with milk (I have not, and will not, make it with water) this creates a very rich hot cocoa.  It is not overly sweet and has a great flavor.  It blends easily and has minimal settling of chocolate particles in the bottom. TL;DR very chocolately!"
"I bought 7 each and product was sent with one cold pack.<br />Chocolate had partially melted fusing the individual pieces together top to bottom forcing me to split a piece off with a sharp knife.<br />Apparently seller is offering factory seconds as there were few packages with the same number of pieces. Sometimes 3 missing, often two, very often one. TL;DR Factory Seconds"
I found these are a bit more expensive than my local health food store but they are less moist so I guess I am getting more date and less water?  Whatever I enjoy them and the fact they are organically grown. TL;DR very tastey
"I cannot get my dog to use this no matter how hard I try.  My dog is the most food motivated dog I've ever known.  She will do ANYTHING for carrots, lettuce, ice cubes... even her own kibble.  But regardless of what I put in this thing, I cannot get her interested in this toy to save either of our lives.  I even tried clicker training her on it!  She doesn't associate it with food no matter what I do. TL;DR My dog hates it"
Awesome noodles! I would recommend rinsing the noodles thoroughly before you cook them. I noticed an odd flavor when they are prepared without being rinsed. TL;DR Yum
"I expected to receive the flavors listed for the variety pack:<br /><br />Blue Moon<br />Butter Pecan<br />Chocolate<br />Orange Custard Chocolate Chip<br />Strawberry<br />Vanilla<br /><br />I don't know what Blue Moon is but all the other flavors looked very appealing, and I particularly wanted a premium vanilla ice cream to pair with a high quality balsamic vinegar.<br /><br />Unfortunately I only received two of the above flavors - Blue Moon and Chocolate. I got two other chocolate varieties (Mint Chocolate Cookie and Chocolate Turtle), a Fudge Marble and a Caramel Capuccino. So, three chocolates and a fudge, one coffee-flavored (sadly I don't like coffee-flavored anything, other than coffee itself) and a Blue Moon.<br /><br />Overall, two stars for shipping the wrong stuff with little variety. However I might bump up the star rating once I've ate the ice cream.<br /><br />Update<br />Nothing special about the ice cream. Not bad, but no better than store-bought stuff and a heck of a lot more expensive. TL;DR Wrong flavors, little variety"
"When I ordered these I was really hoping for some seriously tasty pepperoni sticks after reading reviews claiming that these were ""packed with big flavor.""  Pepperoni they are not.  If you are expecting seriously spicy and rich pepperoni you will be let down as I was.  Does that make these treats bad?  No, I still found them to be good in their own right.  They're like Slim Jim's that actually taste like you're eating meat as opposed to extruded grease logs.  They're pretty good and I may buy them again but be warned that it's just not quite pepperoni.<br /><br />On a side note, I received a sample of their 3 day cold smoked ""Old Smokies"" and those things are God in meat form, I highly recommend those. TL;DR Not Quite Pepperoni"
"This product is good in theory, however just couldnt get our dog to pay attention to it after training him that food comes out when you tug. He still just tried to lick in the open hole....he is too used to his Kong.<br />But it is really put together well. I like it, but unfortunatley my dog does not,therefore I had to put it at 3 stars. TL;DR Maybe my dog isn't the brightest...."
Great product.  Only reason I do not give it 5 stars is because I found it cheaper at Meijers. TL;DR Good product
"The lemon drops were as expected but the took so long to get here that they missed the party for which they were intended.  We ended up having to buy some at the local store.  I guess we will snack on these for Halloween, instead. TL;DR Lemon Drops"
"Product is great.<br />With that said, make sure and check your local supermarket price for this item first. I have become so accustomed to getting deals on Amazon that sometimes I don't even compare costs. Winds up that the regular price for one package of this item at my local supermarket is $2.99. Could have gotten a bag for free and had money left over had I just checked while I was doing my regular shopping.<br />Like Costco, Amazon doesn't always wind up saving you money. TL;DR Check your prices!!!"
"These DZ licorice buttons are what are known in Northern Europe as Salmiak pastilles. Salmiak, or sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride salt) used to be prescribed as a expectorant for head colds. Sal ammoniac is also used as soldering flux to clean metal. The sugar was used to cover the very strong, corrosive taste. Those who've acquired a taste for them crave them.  All others spit them out within ten seconds. I use them as a diet aid, as two or three will put you off food for hours. Keep them in their resealable tubs as they attract water from the air. TL;DR Chewy Salmiak Buttons"
"My puppy loves these treats! She's allergic to wheat and gluten so it's hard to find treats for her (and ones that she likes). She has naturally dry skin and these definitely help! The omega 3 & 6 fatty acids provide what she needs to keep her coat healthy and shiny. It's great-- they don't contain any wheat, soybean, glutens, bad preservatives, or by-products. Not to mention that the salmon and sweet potatoes in it are known to be easily digestible. She gets so excited when I bring out the bag. Worth the money! Highly recommended! TL;DR High quality yummy treat for dogs!"
"My 9 year old absolutely loves it!  Of course she is a fancy Nancy fan and whenever I sit down to have my Latte, she feels all grown up to have her fancy hot chocolate with her Mommy.  Love the taste and aromatic coconut scent.  I think its great she loves it and its different, she loves it and that is the most important thing she feels she now has her own special drink like Mommy when we cozy up to hot drink.  I have to find some more as she is upset she has ran out and we were lucky to find this one at Home Goods, now have to see where I can order some. TL;DR Perfectly Fancy!!!"
"I was quite excited to try Lipton's new Tea & Honey To Go packets. While I was a bit skeptical of the five calories proposed for each 8-ounce serving, seeing as how honey is a fairly high caloric sweetener, I figured I'd give it a go anyway. So after receiving the tea, I mixed it up per the instructions and took a sip. Yowzas! The tea was super sweet with a bit of strawberry flavor and no tea that I could taste. I ended up watering the tea down enough that one packet, which is usually two servings, ends up as four or five 8-oz. servings. The berry flavor became very diluted while there was still that taste of icky sweetness. Overall the berry flavors and tea are weak, even undiluted, and I noticed no honey flavor what-so-ever, so took a look-see at the ingredients where I spotted sucralose (an artificial sweetener) thrown right in the middle of things. Now that is where the sweetness is and don't take kindly to that addition, as I avoid artificial sweeteners whenever possible. Seeing as how Lipton is sneakily claiming this is sweetened with honey (And look! NO aspartame!), with no mention that in actuality the sweeteners are honey granules, which are made from both honey and sugar, and sucralose except by viewing the ingredients list, makes me angry because I've been swindled. Yeah, this is natural all right. I'm definitely not going to trust Lipton's marketing from now on and urge them to think about switching to a natural sweetener such as stevia. So if you like your food natural, best to skip this, but if you're not so picky and don't mind artificial sweeteners in your food, then give it a go if you're interested. I'll not be trying any other flavors of this product. TL;DR Beware Advertising!"
I learned to eat this rice when I was stationed in Hawaii.  The kind of long grain rice you buy in the grocery pales in comparison.  This is plump tasty rice.  Not always available near me. Thank heavens for Amazon. TL;DR Best rice ever
"Go to a major food chain (like shop rite, pathmark) and you can purchase these for less (and you won't have to buy 12 of them. Amazon's food is never a better bargain - especially when you have to buy such a large quantity. TL;DR Not worth the price"
"My 7 month old daughter would spit up (vomit) 45 minutes to an hour after a bottle.  The doctor changed her formula from Enfamil Lipil to Enfamil Gentlease.  It did help with her fusiness, but no help with the spit up.  Two days ago I was on Amazon reading the reviews of this formula and thought I had nothing to lose.  I started her on it and so far her spit up problem has been cured.  I am amazed at the change in her and wished I had known about this formula when my son was born because he too had the same problem. This has been a lifesaver. TL;DR What a difference!!!!"
"This is the first time I've tried Higgins & Burke Teas.  I really enjoy Bigelow English Breakfast Tea so I thought I might like this as well.  It is NOT the same, or really even similar, but it is a good tea, in my opinion.  I confess, I drink coffee almost daily and tea, only occasionally.<br /><br />It's not too strong for me, as I don't care for really strong drinks, but is flavorful.  I use a bit of sugar in my tea, and sometimes cream if it's stronger and depending on the variety.  This tasted good with just the sugar.  I enjoyed this the few times I've tried it and still have quite a few bags left.  I will update if I have anything to add.  I do like the individual packs that this comes in as it is kept fresher longer.<br /><br />If Bigelow EBT and this were side by side, I'd pick the Bigelow, but of course that's personal preference.  It's a good tea and an worthwhile and interesting change from the usual. TL;DR Not the Best I've Tried"
"I love bold coffee, and I drink it black so it has to be good, no cream or flavored powders or sweeteners, just a cup of black coffee. Emeril's is a dark roast, full bodied, great mid morning pick me up TL;DR Bold indeed"
These are very tasty.  A great item to have on hand when you need toasted almonds.  No more burned almonds in my house. TL;DR theartist47
"I was hoping for true granulated garlic and not pulverized powder.  Well I was a bit disappointed when I received this powder.  The reason I wanted true granules is that they retain the garlic flvor much longer than powder.  In the year or so that it will take me to use this, i think the flavor will be gone - unlike true granulated garlic which holds the flavor much longer.  Fool me once -- but don't get fooled again. TL;DR I thought granulated was not powder"
Honestly I was attracted by the great price and free shipping on an 16+ liter kit. If you have ever done a kit before this was no different then all of the rest. Ingredients are clearly marked and the directions are adequate.<br /><br /> My kit has been in the bottle now for 6 months and the wine is light bodied and very approachable.<br /><br />Planning on starting another one of these kits in the next month. TL;DR Great kit for the price
"This big, delicious, moist and chewy cookie fits the bill for a great on-the-go breakfast or travel meal. Note that one serving is half a cookie, which would be plenty as a dessert or snack. But a whole cookie makes a meal, and is very filling.<br />Read the ingredient list carefully and you will see one *important* difference between this brand and other ""healthy"" cookie or pastry-bar type treats: (organic) WHOLE wheat flour. Not ""wheat flour"", which is the same as white flour, and has no nutritional value.<br />Another plus is that even the chocolate chips in the cookie are sweetened with low-glycemic malted barley, not cane sugar.<br />I'm looking forward to trying more varieties of Nana's cookies. TL;DR The best cookie and a great breakfast treat."
"I love this product, especially the quality of the pumper device.  This is the only pump style salmon oil I've found that doesn't leak fishiness onto my hand and/or fail to reach the bottom third of the oil in the container.  My dogs love the oil itself.  It prevents dandruff on my border collie mix.<br /><br />My complaint is that the product leaked during shipment, causing it and everything else in the box to have a thin but pungent coating of fish oil on it.  The bottle was sealed in a plastic bag within the box, but the oil leached through the plastic.<br /><br />If you can find this product at your local pet shop, I highly recommend buying it there rather than risking leaks during shipment. TL;DR Great product, but leaks during shipping"
more like rice cracker they're good a little inconsistent in the thickness but tasty little discs of brown rice puffiness TL;DR did someone say rice cake?
"The Pacari Chocolate Covered Golden Berries are delicious!  I love goldenberries and they are typically very tart.  These goldenberries are mild in comparison.  I mainly taste the delicious dark chocolate with just a hint of tangy citrus sort of like orange dark chocolate only tangier slightly.  Would subscribe n save if Amazon offers!  Delicious!<br /><br />The golden berry is a fruit native to the Andean region. It provides a wonderful sweet-tart complement to the dark chocolate coating.<br />Ingredients: Cacao beans*, cacao butter*, evaporated cane juice*, sunflower lecithin*, golden berries (*certified organic) (Dairy and soy free, may contain traces of nuts).<br />Size: 57g/ 2oz.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/17/12 - finally Amazon has it back in stock!  Woo Hoo!  BUT what arrived was completely melted so that it was like chocolate tapioca pudding in a pouch.  Boo Hoo!!! : (  Amazon CSR said she would have a replacement sent to me when it was back in stock.....<br /><br />UPDATE 10/18/12 - the four pack that arrived today was in pristine condition!  I ate two boxes upon arrival!  These are sooooooooooooooooooooo tasty!<br /><br />UPDATE 10/26/12 - the four pack that arrived 10/19 was again in pristine condition like 10/18 delivery!  Unfortunately, I have eaten them all and they are out of stock.  : (<br />Please get more in stock, so I can order more! TL;DR One of my favorite things! DELICIOUS when it arrives unmelted"
"I just had this stuff for breakfast today and I love it. I like the funny texture it has. All one has to do is have some fresh fruit and yogurt and Bob's yer Uncle. LOVE IT!!! I will buy this again. By the way, It beats having to buy it from Canada where the shipping is almost 2x the amount of the product. TL;DR YUM!!!"
"First, you have to like real, bold coffee (which I do) to like this coffee. If you like this coffee, also try Jet Fuel, Organic, and Wake Up Call. Each of these is similar but have slightly different tastes. I like to buy them in boxes of 50 using automatic delivery (can't beat the price that way).<br /><br />The coffee tastes great. I would classify it as bold/extra bold. I gave it 5 stars, and I continue to buy it along with the others that I mentioned. TL;DR Coffee with kick"
These peppers had a wonderful smell and a great flavor. I use them in a LOT of recipes. They are not over dried which is typical of the ones I find at the mega-mart. I will buy these again and again. TL;DR Great Peppers
This mix is absolutely yummy!  It's a very refreshing summer drink.  It's really easy to mix.  We carried it dry to the UK in our luggage when we went to visit family for our family to try.  We bought the rum in duty free and mixed it up when we got there.  It was a hit!  Great summer drink. TL;DR Yum!
"It has no added salt, is whole grain, and is made from rice varieties impossible to find in supermarkets. I use it with whatever stir fry I make in my wok.  It heats in the microwave(do not overcook) and provides enough for two portions. Be careful if you reheat the left over portion a second time.  It dries out and gets hard unless you add a little broth or coconut milk before putting it back in the microwave.  This product is sold in some health food stores and gourmet food markets,but it is difficult to find. Amazon makes it easy. TL;DR A fast and healthy Asian side dish"
"I tried this one as well as the one with the knots on the end.  I had to take each one away after a few hours, wait several days and give it back to her to finish up in a few more hours.  It also gave her gas.  I do have an aggressive chewer which is why I tried these rather expensive rawhides.  I will not purchase again. TL;DR Didn't last a day"
"Nutiva coconut oil has such a nice coconut scent and flavor - unlike other oils I've used. Some people might prefer ""unscented"" but if you're going to do that, then use some other kind of oil! I made rice last night and stir fried it in this oil - my husband LOVED it! Excellent product:) TL;DR I love coconut oil!"
The Milca Alpine Milk Chocolate is very good. The taste is creamy and my family absulutely loves it. TL;DR Millka Alpenmilch
"Trying to find decaffeinated Bigelow tea was not easy in Columbia, SC  They had the regular, but not decafinated.  I just ordered 3 cases of Bigelow Decaffeiniated Constant Comment tea.  Many of my friends think I have made special tea when they taste it.  They are thrilled to know it is easy to have this wonderful tea with a hint of orange.  I have been enjoying it for 50+ years! TL;DR Love this tea!"
I love this tea because it really does what it says--soothes the throat.  Great for singers and speakers! TL;DR yogi tea review
"These sparkles work very well as cake decor, but be aware that they have no taste.  They are edible, but I usually use decor that is sweet, or made of types of candy, and these were just there.  Don't worry, they're inoffensive!  You barely notice their existence, flavor and texture-wise.  They are just for pretty.  And for that, they're great!  The tiny bottle also gives you more glitter than you might think.  I glitterated 18 cupcakes with one half of one bottle.  A great deal! TL;DR Beautiful but tasteless"
"We originally got this for our Bengals, it was what the breeder recommended.  Then, we found two kittens only a day old on the street and adopted them.<br /><br />After they were weaned they took to this stuff like gangbusters.  Now, they are both 20 plus pound monster kitties.  Never sick a day in their lives, glossy coats, full of energy.<br /><br />Picky cats love Felidae, it is full of healthy ingredients.  Obviously, however, it's not the best food for cat weight control! Now the boys are on a ""light"" cat food, and they aren't quite as happy.<br /><br />So, I suggest this for Bengals or cats who need to put on a few pounds. TL;DR Miracle-grow for cats!"
"I like this product, but the prices is too high in the grocery store, so I get these at costco for 14.99 for a case of 12. I don't particularly like the orange one, and at costco the case is a variety pack. I was looking for a single flavor case. The price here is too high. not much less than what you pay for a single in the grocery store. TL;DR expesive here"
"good taste, gets mushy easily, but worth while for all the goodness in it. the nutrition outweighs the mushy part. I would definately recommend, TL;DR wonderful"
"I was on-line looking for a popcorn popper for a wedding gift.  The Amish country popcorn came up as a match for my search.  My family loves popcorn so I thought I would try it.  I love this popcorn.  They a little pieces of popcorn.  They are almost hull free, which is something I really like.  The popcorn kernels are fresh!  I will be purchasing more of this product! TL;DR Yummy!"
The taste of this produce is fine.  But when I received this flat of 12 cans each and every can was badly dented.  I do not buy dented cans in a grocery store and I do not expect to receive dented cans when I purchase from the Internet. TL;DR VERY DISAPPOINTED
"I liked the fact that the mix doesn't contain a long list of chemicals - just flour, sugar, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and vanilla. Fun to make and not overly sweet, just right. I followed the package instructions EXACTLY and just had to add eggs, oil, and milk (I used mostly soymilk with a bit of half & half).  Baked in a Le Creusut 7x10"" pan and the result was light and fluffy on the inside, crispy & golden on the outside. Everyone flipped for it, including a couple of cornbread gourmands. TL;DR Big hit at party"
"I really like this as a pie or tart.  I often add fresh berries as a topping.  When I use it for company it is always a hit.  So nice to have a sugar free, low fat dessert that really does taste good. TL;DR Great dessert"
"The product was excellent but, the shipping was extremely over priced.<br />Would find a better way to order the product in the future. TL;DR great product over priced shipping"
product arrived in good order and now I must wait for my next blood test to see how effective it is. TL;DR tastey little chew
"My 8 month old isn't quite capable of sucking the food out of those things yet, but if I squeeze it out into a bowl and spoonfeed her, she LOVES them! Mommy thinks they're rather tasty too ;) I felt like it was great value for our money, as we will be using these on vacation to lighten our loads (versus glass jars) but they're not cheap enough to buy for everyday use. I normally make my own baby food. TL;DR Tasty, good for traveling, lightweight"
"Okay, no matter what treat I bring her, sausages, hot dogs, pork hide, she ALWAYS takes these first!<br /><br />I don't know why, but she prefers them over any other. My dog is a mix between a Labrador, and a black retriever.<br />She's 6 months old.<br />I guess she loves to chew on her food. These treats are dried meat, chicken hide, and other things. They're NOT dry or hard, but more like chewy hard leather!<br /><br />My wife tried to taste it, she says she does not understand why the dog likes these, as they are flavorless.<br /><br />A bag like this lasts us almost 5 months.<br /><br />Whether or not they are made in China, or elsewhere, I really don't care.<br />My dog loves them, and they're tested by the food agency and inspection.<br /><br />If they pass the food inspection agency of the USA, they can get imported, and will be sampled regularly. If they are found unsafe, they will be recalled. Usually you will be aware within a few weeks, to a few months. By that time you may have given her only upto a quarter of the bag.<br />To many it may sound like you've poisoned your dog, but that's not true.<br />Chances are very small you'll get your dog sick,as long as you don't feed her this instead of food, only give one or two to her a day as a treat, the levels of toxication are far below anything dangerous.<br /><br />There are people freaking out that they might kill their dog, and perhaps, there is a 20% chance that your dog will die of cancer in the future because of this treat you gave her; but then perhaps that cancer could come from a barbecued hotdog too!<br />So either way, I'm not too worried about it. as long as it looks safe, isn't full of fungus or maggots, or weird colors, and it passes the food administration service, I'm fine with this.<br /><br />Again, if you keep these to a maximum of 2, 3, maybe 4 treats a day for a large dog, the chances of intoxication are so low, that they are virtually non-existent.<br /><br />My dog's happy with them, and I'm happy with them. I add them as a variety to the other treats she gets, like pork hide, cookies, and chew sticks. TL;DR Made in China, or not; My dog LOVES them!"
"These consist of a crispy chocolate shell with one hazelnut inside, nestled in a soft whip of chocolate.  I love these chocolates. They look ""fancy"" all wrapped up in gold foil! TL;DR Crispy chocolate !"
i love these crackers! they are reall good. good chese flavor. crispy and cheaper than goldfish! highly recommended. please buy! TL;DR these are good.
"creamy tasty  perfect as a tortilla dip, side order, or in your favorite burritto!  5 stars TL;DR best there is!"
"These ""White Fudge"" covered Pretzels are very good and make a good sweet snack since the white fudge covering is fairly thin, just enough to make it tasty but not enough to be overpowering. These get eaten up fairly quickly by my teens if we leave them out, so we generally put out one or two bags at a time.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH TL;DR White Fudge Covered Pretzels - Recommended"
Though this product is a little spendy I was pleased with the flavor and that it mixed well with other ingredients. It made homemade ice cream taste much more creamy. Good stuff! TL;DR Very Yummy
You can get these at Costco for $4.50.  Each box contains two packs.  They are very good.  I use them as teacher gifts.  I take the two gold wrapped packages in the box - wrap in a clear bag with green and red ribbon = a $2.25 christmas gift. TL;DR cheaper elsewhere!
"The worst, threw most of it away, will stick to the high quality that I find in local grocery store, a tad more expensive but this is not good TL;DR Horrible"
"This is a nice dark red tea.  Not like most herbal teas which normally do not get very dark.  The flavor is very robust, as I said, almost like the cinnamon gum or cinnamon candies.  No need for milk, just use honey.  It is delicious, like having a dessert. TL;DR Tastes like the Big Red Gum"
"I first fell in love with the Leonidas chocolates while in Belgium and now I finally found them online. If I was in New York, you would probably find me at the Manon Cafe in the winter sipping hot chocolates. In the summer, I'd be at the Leonidas' store buying gourmet chocolates. After savoring chocolates in Europe, Africa and America - these are the best chocolates I have ever tasted.<br /><br />The crunchy chocolate squares were a real surprise and I love how delicate the crunch is when encased in a burst of delicious chocolate.<br /><br />You may also enjoy the Mint chocolates. They are delicious after dinner or anytime you want to wake up your taste buds. The mint flavor bursts from these chocolates as if it was encased in little sugar crystals. It is quite perfect and refreshing.<br /><br />I also love the Cinnamon and Orange. If you have been dreaming of the most delicious orange flavored chocolates in the world, you have to try the Orange Napolitains. I love both equally, although the cinnamon flavor has me completely seduced.<br /><br />I prefer to savor each piece of chocolate with a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. The warmth of the beverage creates an entirely different experience than if you were to simply taste a square of chocolate on its own.<br /><br />Once your mouth is warmed, take a small bite of the chocolate square and enter Mint Chocolate Oblivion. The world stops for minutes at a time as you savor a mingling of the best cinnamon you have ever tasted with the silkiest creamiest Belgian chocolate in the world.<br /><br />If you wish to try all the Napolitains, I'd suggest the 1 pound sampler Ballotin with six varieties. Leonidas now has over 1700 stores and sales locations worldwide and they offer over 80 varieties of fresh chocolates. The chocolates are air freighted weekly from Brussels so you will always find the quality to be superior.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review TL;DR Deliciously Crunchy"
"I could discern little taste difference after mixing this with Vinegar and Olive oil as specified on the package. It's ok, but nothing really stands out with the flavoring.  Is it the ""natural"" angle they were going for here?  I'm not sure.  Maybe this might work better as a marinade mixture, but as for going to the trouble of mixing this with regular Vinegar & Olive oil, why bother? TL;DR Grab some oregano and call it a day!"
"We got two of these bones for our 70+lb pit bull terriers. I was skeptical that it wouldn't hold up because I haven't had much luck with obtaining items they cannot destroy within minutes. THESE WORKED. Both dogs love their bones (it was their Christmas present), and they have yet to make much of a dent. The dogs definitely make indention marks, but nothing more than scuffs from their teeth. I see these bones lasting quite a while and I look forward to it! :) Thanks Nylabone! TL;DR Great Bone for Pit Bulls!"
I was excited about the excellent reviews this food got. No fillers to slow my older dog down and he enjoys the product. TL;DR Nutrisca grain free dry dog food
"My Maltese was on Eukanuba before I noticed that he stopped eating as much food, then I switched him over to a BilJac brand and at first he seemed like he liked it but then after awhile he threw up consistently. After reading reviews I switched over to Blue Buffalo and he loves it, there wasn't any problems switching him over. The kibble isn't big so he can eat it easily and his stool is healthy, I'll be sticking with this one for awhile. TL;DR Sticking with this one"
"It's not as good as I hoped, but canned chowder never is. I added some butter, a can of chopped clams, and some milk - then thickened it a bit. It works great as a base, but not for me straight out of the can. TL;DR Clam Chowder"
"This is the read deal. Exactly as I remember from growing up in Philly and South Jersey. Perfect on a hoagie, hot dogs, or any sandwich you can make. I just got my order and will definetly be ordering more next month. Shipping was fast and cheap at CityMade Inc on Amazon.com. TL;DR The Real Deal"
"I disagree with the previous reviewer. I paid $14 for one of the bigger jars of the Victoria brand salt and vowed to never buy another finishing salt again. It's sweet, light, and perfect for sprinkling without fear of overkill. This salt tastes like regular $5 salt to me. I'd send it back if it wouldn't cost nearly as much to ship it, but trust me when I tell you the Victoria brand is unlike anything you've ever tasted. I read the backs of both jars and this one is harvested from the whole island, where the Victoria brand is harvested from the one coast. Don't know if it makes a difference, but the sodium content is much higher in this brand and therefore a little too twingy for my taste. TL;DR Metallic. Mediocre. Meh."
"It is a shame that I can only purchase this item on line. The stores in Miami, Florida does not sell it. My husband was born in Rhode Island and remembers it from his child hood days. Besides it being good in milk it is excellent over ice cream. It would make a good adult coffee syrup for over ice cream or in a milk shake. TL;DR Good stuff"
"I used to drink this while growing up in the UK. When you do the math of how much it costs to make each drink, it comes out very affordable.<br />Scott TL;DR Great affordable soft drink"
"Midnight Magic has a wonderfully bold flavor. The aroma and flavor make my mornings extra special. Plus, the price is right! I plan to enjoy many more delicious cups of this java. TL;DR Wonderfully Bold"
"I drink tea every day, but I do enjoy the occasional cup of coffee every once in a while. Because of that, I can justify paying premium prices for good coffee. Let me tell you, this coffee is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />I had actually purchased the coffee without realizing that the beans were whole-bean. I quickly purchased a grinder. The grinder came four days after the coffee did. If I had known how good this coffee was beforehand, those four days would have been torture.<br /><br />Mind you, I'm basing this review on the fact that I have only brewed one pot so far, but one pot was all it took. This coffee is amazingly silky smooth and doesn't leave a harsh aftertaste like other coffees. It's a little on the light side, so if you like your coffee strong, I'd recommend about 1.5-2 rounded tablespoons per cup.<br /><br />I am definitely a believer in Kona Coffee now. I will be buying more of this in the future for myself and as gifts, though I'll probably use it before I have a chance to give it out. TL;DR Nectar of the Heavens"
"This stuff really works. Being a college kids I was looking for a cheap way to make some good alcohol to serve to my friends at dinners or social situations and man did I find it. You can use a lot of different types of juice and consequently have a lot of options for the type of drink you want. I also found that after about 6 days the fermentation levels off and the drink can not become any more alcoholic, I assume because of the lack of available sugar for the yeast to convert. Anyway, at this point it doesnt exactly taste the best. Its not too bad but if you are going for taste only leave it go for maybe 4 days.<br /><br />Not only would I recommend this to a friends, I actually have, and because it came in a two pack I was able to let them try it while I made my own. TL;DR Really Good Product"
Smells and taste like muddy water. Read the reviews and bought this but regret it now. The coffee is not strong at all. Smells like something is burnt.<br />Amazon won't even take this back since this is grocery. Save your money and buy some other brand. TL;DR Horrible smell and taste
"Celestial Seasonings began with herbal teas- chamomile, green tea, orange pekoe, and now has branched out into more exotic blends like yerba mate, chai, and rooibos. Morning Thunder, with its surrealistic depiction of bison, is a perfect depiction of this powerful tea. Yerba mate is a stimulant from South America, mainly consumed in Argentina. Celestial Seasonings roasts it, giving it a somewhat burnt flavor. It's more like a revved-up black tea than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028QDMY"">Yerba Mate' Tea -Organic - 25 - Bag</a>, which aims for a more authentic taste. Morning Thunder has the earthy flavor, but Sebastopol's Guayaki goes for the authenticity. Celestial Seasonings offers a savory, spicy introduction for the newbie. It's a delicious wake-up call in a cup! TL;DR Bison at Breakfast"
Great Flavor.  The mixes are great.  We rinse out gallon milk containers and make this a gallon at a time.  Way better than seeing the kids drink Soda. TL;DR Love Gatorade and the mixes save some $$
"If you're anything like me and you love jerky, but are reluctant (from a cholesterol perspective) to go to town on a pound of beef jerky, this ahi tuna jerky does the trick.  seasoned well, and much more healthy (unless you're freaked out about mercury as well in which case you should you should throw in the towel and go vegan) then this is great.  Only complaint is how expensive it is by the ounce and some of the pieces are really, REALLY hard.  All in all delish and nutrish. TL;DR Healthy Jerk"
"Not the best quality, a few pieces seemed to be slighly out dated. Overall though, it was a good buy. Most of the pieces were fresh and it brought back some memories and that to me is what really made this a great value. The two ladies that recieved this thought it was great, and told me stories about the fourties that made me laugh, so I would suggest this if you are looking to give it as a gift to someone in say their seventies or eighties like I did. TL;DR Cute."
"My mom got these and I tried them. It has a good taste to it, and it is also healthy. The dark cherry and chocolate flavoring do well together. It is a nice afternoon snack, to get rid of the hunger pains till dinner. TL;DR It has a nice taste to it."
"The BEST chip EVER. Awesome flavor, subtle yet bold.  Blows away Lays, Wise or any other chip on the market. TL;DR #1"
"I am on vacation and this is the longest I ever had to spend away from my cat. I left her in the care of my mom. I decided I wanted to send her something new (food wise) because of all the problems that has been going on with Iams and stuff. Although I am still not back home, my mother tells me that she goes crazy for this stuff. My mom also said that the food does not smell nearly as bad as the market brand cat food. I am happy with these results, sounds awesome. TL;DR On vacation"
I was searching for bread mixes for my bread machine and came across this bread mix. This bread mix can not be used for your bread machine however it is a great mix for anytime of the day. TL;DR Easy and Delicious
"Nothing at all against this, or any other seller selling this item. I very much enjoyed my DIY ""spiked"" drinks. However, if you purchase straight from the manufacturing company, this kit is nearly $8 less shipped (dependent on location of course.)<br /><br />Again, I really do like the product and had a great experience with this seller, just thought I'd throw this out there. TL;DR I like the product a lot but do not buy on Amazon.com"
"I love this sweetener! I use it on everything - in my coffee, my tea, on my oats. Hard to believe it's not bad for you and it tastes so good! TL;DR Love this sweetener!"
"These were fantastic. They arrived promptly and were the perfect addition to my son's Elmo theme party. Of course the kids loved them, but they got great reviews from the adults too. TL;DR Perfect extra"
"I actually buy this product for my sisters every year at Birthdays and Christmas because they can no longer find it in stores. They loved it growing up and still love it today! Great chocolate taste and a nice, hot, hearty breakfast on cold winter mornings. YUM! TL;DR Favorite from our childhood"
"I was a little frightened the first time I was asked to cater a wedding reception that was all gluten free, once I found out that I could order the gf pasta from Amazon I thought it might not be to bad after all.  It cooked up like any other pasta except the water was a little murky and the pasta did have almost the same flavor.  I was quite pleased as were the guests.  On the down side would be the 12 oz packages (I would have liked it better in bulk) and the price was more than I would have spent.  All in all, if approached again, I would place another order. TL;DR Gluten Free Pasta"
"I had to go on a gluten and dairy free diet. I have found these cookies to be delicious to the point that I don't even miss the ones I used to eat before. When I take them to work the ""normal"" eaters keep asking for them! Since I can't get my hands on them easily in my area I just order the chocolate, ginger snaps and oatmeal varieties from Amazon and have them home in two or three days. Keep making them Dr. Lucy! TL;DR Gluten and dairy free doesn't hurt any more"
"This was a great transaction, no problems and I got my order quickly.  Thanks TL;DR Great Transaction"
I have a hard time drinking plain bottled water and these flavor packets are fantastic!  The flavor is not too overpowering which is nice - it's just a touch of tropical flavor. TL;DR Delicious!
"i was eacited to buy this hot sauce because of the high rating from an Americas Test Kitchen tast test & comparison. i was surprised to find it, although very tasty, it was very mild. i like very hot hot sauces so be careful. it appears that the Americas test kitchen tasters, though i value their opinions very much, are kind of wimps for hot sauce. TL;DR not as hot"
"I ordered these on a whim, and found them wonderful. They are tart, crisp and delicious, and made a wonderful addition to sandwiches and cheese trays. TL;DR Wonderful little pickles!"
All right...you can get Jolly Ranchers ANY WHERE! But try to get a bunch of all ONE Flavor!  Which is exactly what I ordered and Got! And...delivered by Christmas!  Thanks for a GREAT Service & Product!! TL;DR Jolly Ranchers!!!
These brownies are moist and delicious just like we have come to expect from Betty Crocker.  They are the best tasting gluten free mixes I've found yet. TL;DR Gluten Free Brownies are better than those containing Gluten
I didn't care for these. It tastes like old salty ham and that horrible clove oil used for tooth aches. It's disgusting. I couldnt even eat it past half way. I actually had to get up and brush my teeth. TL;DR Disgusting!
"My mother used to make this pizza every week when I was a kid.  I LOVED it.  I moved cross-country about 14 years ago and had almost forgotten it existed as you can't find it anywhere in Los Angeles.  Someone from back home mentioned it recently and I went on an internet hunt for it soon after.  I was DELIGHTED to find this seller on Amazon and beg them to keep it in stock!  It's almost exactly as I remember -- crispy and tangy and fantastic!  It does seem like the pizza sauce is thinner, more watery, then I remembered it being, but when it bakes, it's bubbly and rich.  There's never enough cheese, but I always have ground parmesian on hand, so with a few extra sprinkles of that, I think it's about perfect.  So excited to have it again.  If only the shipping charge was a bit better... this would be a meal for a steal. TL;DR Childhood memories..."
"After years of never being able to have flavored coffee creamer because of all the hydrogenated oils I finally found this. I am for the convenience of the singles, but if you like big cups of coffee be prepared to use 2-3 per cup. It's a lot cheaper to get the large size if you drink a lot of coffee every week, but if your a once in awhile coffee drinker these are nice. They have a very nice vanilla taste and there is enough sugar to satisfy your sweet tooth. Very good product without all the added yucky stuff. TL;DR Better than plain half and half"
If you love chocolate & nuts you need to try these.. The dark chocolate flavor is great.<br />Pretty much the perfect snack.. TL;DR Excellent !!
"46 grams, 220 calories, and 110 fat calories. The bar is a mix of peanuts, rice, and granola on a layer of peanut butter. I kept the bar in my shirt pocket for about an hour before eating and it made the peanut butter melt a little and stick to the wrapper.<br /><br />Taste wise it was delicious. Saltier than I would have liked - 160 mg sodium. Wrapper claims it is 30% bigger, and I did feel that the bar lasted longer. It was filling and satisfying.<br /><br />I found it interesting that there are only 5 bars in each box. There is room for the sixth one, but why would you put only 5?<br /><br />Overall, I recommend the product. I feel it could have been made bit more healthful. I am sure I will enjoy the remaining bars. TL;DR Planters Big Nut Bar - Very good and filling"
Excellent customer service and availabilty of grocery items that are fresh and yummy!  The efficiency and Fast Shipment of my order is awesome! TL;DR Great Deal on Kelloggs Cereal Variety Pack
"Good quality wild rice, few broken pieces, cooks up well, okay price.  Good mixed with other rices.  Would order again. TL;DR Good Quality Wild Rice..."
"CRACKERTILLA is a word I came up with because this snack is both a thin, round cracker and tortilla chip all in one.  It is light, crispy, and quite tasty. We strongly sense the company really believes that, ""Food Should Taste Good.""<br /><br />Although we were skeptical at first, the unique olive flavor attracted us to this product. In addition, there are NO artificial colors, flavors, or GMOs in the ingredients.<br /><br />After opening the bag, we observed an attractive sight and scent and . This product is not like average chips, it has the aroma of real-food. The taste is also unlike any other, not only because of the olive flavor, but because of the marriage between the cracker and tortilla chip. The crispness is just right, and the Olive flavor is included without dominating other ingredients. The one-ounce serving size is just right and allows one to easily travel or pack this with a lunch.<br /><br />Overall, this healthy snack is recommended for both kids and adults. TL;DR Crackertilla"
"I am not a cereal eater, but after trying Dorset Berries and Cherries, I think that I will become one.  This cereal is so good, my only fear is eating the whole box in one sitting.  The taste is amazing, not too sweet, but delicious enough to think it is a treat.  I also like the sustainability of the packaging. TL;DR Awesome Cereal"
"Ginger Peach Tea has the most amazing peach smell.  Who does not love peach?  It feels so luxurious to smell and sip a sun-ripened peach.  Even though I'm down South, I enjoy it warm or hot all year long.  (Thank the Lord for air conditioning!)  The warmth enhances the odor and thus the flavor.  It's also good cold.  It has become my favorite tea.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FQJT3Q"">Kindle 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6"" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology</a>)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040GJJ02"">DecalGirl Kindle Skin (Fits 6"" Display, Latest Generation Kindle) Tahiti (Matte Finish)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA0PIQ"">The Twilight Saga Collection</a> TL;DR Ginger Peach Tea A Hit"
"This is the best pie crust in the world.  I have tried others but this one is just the best.  I can't find it in the stores anymore so I get it on Amazon.  When I can't buy it at all anymore, I'll do homemade because other pie crusts just don't cut it. TL;DR The best pie crust on Earth!"
"First off, the things listed in product features are untrue. It's just the Muddy Buddies which are peanut butter and chocolate covered Chex which are then heavily dusted with powdered sugar, or confectioner's sugar if you call it that. I make these all the time at home and there isn't a huge difference, however these are less chocolaty than I believe they would be using the recipe on a box of Chex.  You can toss the bag in the fridge if you prefer them cold like they would be if they were homemade.<br /><br />Overall I think that they're a good snack. They're nice for when you just can't make them yourself, say, going camping or living in a dorm. Also be sure to note the other reviewer. I did not purchase these from the seller. I am reviewing the product only. TL;DR Good Product, But a Poor Listing"
"Our ferret loves this rabbit; it's a nice high protein treat in addition to his regular Evo ferret diet. The price was reasonable compared to our local pet store, which doesn't often have this item in stock. TL;DR Our ferret loves this..."
"De-caf, fat free, nearly carb free, delicious. What more could you want? I drink it in skim milk with a tiny bit of sacharin added for sweetness for a low carb, no sugar treat. Highly recommended!!!! TL;DR Great product!"
I have had these Brownies on several occasions and they are the best!!<br />I encourage you to try them and find out just how good they are!!<br />I do not think you will be disappointed TL;DR Brownies are the BEST!!
Tastes a lot like honey nut cheerioes but not quite as good. stay fairly crunchy after adding milk. Kids liked them too. TL;DR crunchy nut cereal
"Barry's Irish Breakfast Tea is one of my go-to products when I'm looking for a strong fix or attempting to introduce my friends to tea culture.<br /><br />In Appalachia, I've never encountered Barry's in any of our larger chain stores.  After trying locally available brands of breakfast tea (Twining's, PG, and Tetley) and reading up on what other drinkers prefer, the reviews for Barry's stuck out as a solid Irish favorite--bold and earthy.  At the time of this review, the price is fair when compared to widespread names like Lipton after you account for the quantity given.  It's not unusual to pay around four dollars for a twenty-bag pack of an established product, so I don't have much guilt about coughing up the twelvish dollars to cover everything including shipping when I crave this stuff.  The bite of Barry's tea is noticeably stronger than the stalwart brands present in the States, in my opinion.<br /><br />Are you new to tea?  Maybe an enthusiastic coffee person looking to branch out?  In that case, breakfast teas, and Irish blends in particular, are soon to become your friends.  Their higher caffeine content and rich taste make the transition shamelessly easy.  To prepare a nice serving, simply fill up your favorite mug with cold water according to how much tea you'd like to enjoy, throw that water in a pot, and leave it on high heat until the water just goes beyond a simmer, or begins to bubble gently (around 200 degrees F).  In the meantime, dress your mug with one tea bag per eightish ounces of liquid, then add your choices of sweetener (sugar, honey)  and/or flavoring (mint, vanilla, Chai spice).  Pour the water over the bag(s) as soon as it reaches the boiling point and allow the tea to steep for four to five minutes for a strong cup.  Again, Barry's has a pleasantly robust bitter/deep flavor that coffee drinkers will welcome.  Moreso, it's common in all tea-drinking parts of the world to cut your coffee with milk or cream; a delicious addition that also makes the brew more comforting to the stomach.<br /><br />Just right in winter or with a hearty breakfast, Barry's won't disappoint if you like a traditional yet potent tea. TL;DR Barry's Irish Breakfast Tea"
"Canned chicken noodle soup is a comfort food.  And I haven't had any in years. This is great! Very much like I remember, but it doesn't make me sick.  This doubles my variety in canned soups. TL;DR Canned chicken noodle soup is a comfort food."
"...after paying the shipping the item cost over $11.00<br /><br />That would be perfectly  OK if the lemon-mayo gave a different little ZING! to things I would normally use mayo for.  However, tastewise I didn't care for it, but I thought..oh that's just me. Then my DH said ""Ohh.h.h..h I dont even like the way it smells.""<br />That's too bad, I love mayo and I love lemon, but this product didnt have an appeal to either of us.<br />Finishing with something GOOD to say..it arrived speedily and I love the label..it's an attractive label. TL;DR blah for the bucks"
I once read that the reason there's a difference between American and European chocolate is that Americans view chocolate as candy while it's considered dessert in Europe.  This heavenly chocolate is definitely in the dessert category.  The almonds are perfectly tiny and dispersed throughout rather than the big chunks so often found in the candy bar purchased from the rack near the checkout.  The flavor is incredible.  I love chocolate and this one is definitely in my top five. TL;DR yummy
"These anchovies are packed whole in salt, meaning that in order to bring them to the looks of filleted anchovies you are used to, you will have to clean them yourself. Depending on skill, this process takes between 20 minutes to ... maybe 1.5 hours, so be prepared to work hard for your fish. The idea is to place them under running water (from your faucet). The skin will peel and when the water hits the fish around its fin area it will make the fillets part and you could easily extract the bones. This process requires a bit of skill which can be easily gained with repetition.<br /><br />On the other hand, the taste is definitely at par with that of Ortiz anchovies, making the Agostino Recca anchovies the best in the world as well. The fish is fleshy and not overly dry, and the flavor is interesting without being overpowering. The ""fishy"" taste also survives the salting in these anchovies.<br /><br />For those of you praising anchovies in salt, I would like to recall the fact that you have a choice of the olive oil to put them in - if you like extra virgin oil with the fishes you can have it!  (most anchovies sold in oil would use a lighter, less pungent oil)<br /><br />Given these considerations, I recommend these anchovies wholeheartedly, but you need to know that you have to work to get them! TL;DR Outstanding taste but lots of work!"
"I tried a pack of this gum. It tastes pretty good for a minute or two, but the flavor quickly dies down and then its just plain rubber. Don't believe the 'Long lasting flavor' hype. TL;DR Not long lasting at all"
"I am diabetic and I have tried all of the sugar substitutes and there is nothing out there that compares to IDEAL. I use Ideal every single day. There is absolutely no other product that even comes close to IDEAL. I have recommended this to all of my friends, diabetic and non-diabetic. No after taste, great flavor, ease of use and highly recommended. I honestly love this product. Some have said that the price is a little high but I think that it is worth every single penny. Thank you makers of IDEAL. Time to retire the rest because IDEAL is the BEST! TL;DR Ideal"
"I love this Granola Bar, there always fresh and crispy. They make great snacks and easy to eat on the run.  Plus they are healthy for you too. TL;DR Great"
I have always LOVED this and all of a sudden I made it last night and both my son and I had an after taste of rubbing alcohol when we ate it. I am not sure if it is the new ranch seasoning (because they have changed it from when we used to get it back in the 90's) or what the deal is. I was just wondering if anyone else noticed this? TL;DR Does anyone else taste rubbing alcohol in the new ranch sauce recipe
"This was one of the freshest, crunchiest graham crackers I have ever tried, the individual packages are too big for a single serving, so it is a good idea to have someone to take it away from you before you eat almost 3 servings of graham crackers.<br />I think packing the crackers in single serving sizes would have been more useful.<br />The overall product package is not protective enough to make this a good item for ordering over the internet, I was sent a single box and in each individual package you were lucky to find a single unbroken cracker.<br />The only bright side of ordering this from Amazon would be if you really like making desserts with graham cracker crusts and would like your crackers to come pre-crushed.<br /><br />Final thoughts<br />Tasty item, individual packages too big to be a single serving, overall package is not protective enough to survive Amazon's rather inconsistent packing process. TL;DR Fresh and yummy, but was delivered as mostly crumbs"
"I made cookies with this product , and they were awesome!! I gave some cookies for my friends to try and they also loved them! Can't wait to try other recapies with this. TL;DR Cookies"
"Wow what a suprise.  I couldn't decide between the offerings on Organic Ketchup, but decided on the Muir for a couple reasons that have long since been forgotten, and new ones formed.  It's an amazing combination of ""au nataral organic"" and zest, body and soul.  It seems to be a great deal more sophisticated tasting than your garden variety catsups.  Your kids might notice initially, but surely would find it perfectly suitable for their ever-more-bazaar uses for catsup over time.  If you are concerned at all for your health, your children's health, and the health of the planet, this is surely a spectacular choice.  If you just enjoy higher quality products over generic processed foods, then this will surely please.  Either way, Muir hit a home run.  Thank you.  I'll be purchasing again. TL;DR Rich and Delicious"
"I had the chance to try multiple types of the CLEAR shampoos for men, and while this one works good at controlling dandruff, some of the brands other varities seem to work better. For me I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC"">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a> more then I like this one. This shampoo does leave your hair clean and I believe it helps with dandruff control, but I like the Mint shampoo better.<br /><br />I did have a major shipping issue on this one though. The shampoo was wrapped in a plastic bag and this shampoo was leaking all over the place. I'll add a picture of what it looked like to this product page. TL;DR Works good but like the CLEAR Sport Mint  better"
I have been hooked on Zevia for over a year now - love being able to drink soda again without worrying about sugar or chemicals. Just tried the Cherry Cola and it is awesome! TL;DR New favorite

"My whole family loves black pepper chicken at Chinese restaurants and it was with that in mind that I ordered this sauce - trying to capture the restaurant flavor at home.  Unfortunately it is not even close.  There is black pepper in this sauce, but the flavor doesn't taste anything like the black pepper chicken sauce in the various restaurants we've been at.  I don't mind the taste, but my wife and kids don't like it at all.  If you are going for the restaurant flavor, this isn't it.  If you simply want a new sauce for chicken, this is an ok one. TL;DR Ok, but doesn't taste like Chinese restaurant"
After seeing this on every sitcom table in the UK I had to try it.<br /><br />Made by everyone's favorite Ketchup King Heinz...  HP Sauce pushes the vinegar to the forefront when compared to Ketchup.  Your mouth twinges with the tang of vinegar upon eating this... then you taste the sweetness from the tomato/sugars.  There was also a subtle sweet taste that was somewhat different then Ketchup... which I think is most likely from the dates looking over the ingredients.<br /><br />I was really expecting somthing more like A1 then Ketchup... but I really don't know where I picked up that preconception. Overall I enjoyed it; people into vinegar chips or whatever would really get a kick out of this. TL;DR From a Yank's prespective.
"The price was awesome, much cheaper than what I'd pay in the grocery store, so that's good. The crackers themselves are also good, crunchy and wheaty with a little salt... basically what you'd expect from Wheat Thins. On the downside, the expiration date on them was about 15 days away when I recieved my six pack of these, that was a huge letdown. Honestly it's not like this is the type of product where the expiration date has to be taken extremely seriously, I mean it's not like it's eggs or milk, but at the same time I'm disappointed that Amazon would send me six boxes of these when they're just about to expire. So overall, good price, good product, and shame on whoever decided it's alright to pack these up and ship them out when they're days away from expiring. TL;DR Good price, bad expiration date"
"I LOVE this soup mix and use it often as a marinade for chicken. Easiest recipe: Spray a 13x9 inch pan with Pam. Slice peeled potatoes paper thin and line the bottom of your pan with two layers of your potatoes. Put boneless, skinless chicken over the potatoes. Take two soup packets and combine them in a bowl with 1/3 c. olive or vegetable oil and about 1/3 c. water; mix. Pour marinade over chicken and then bake entire thing for an hour. SO EASY AND SO DELICIOUS! Every time I make this, I get nothing but compliments; it's even my husband's favorite. Lipton nailed it with this one and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves garlic and zesty spices.<br /><br />This was also a pretty good deal since the packets can sometimes be difficult to find at the store and usually aren't on sale for less than $1.50. I'm very happy with my purchase! TL;DR Best marinade ever!"
"I thought I was ordering unsweetened, since I typed ""Almond Milk Unsweetened"" in the search bar. This product came up as the #2 selection, and the price was good, so I bought it. After it arrived, I noticed that it had cane sugar in the ingredients. You would think with unsweetened in the search engine, Amazon would do a better sorting job than to have a sweetened version as the #2 choice. My fault for not looking more closely. Live and learn, the Amazon search engine isn't perfect.<br />Since I cannot have sugar, I cannot rate the product. TL;DR Disappointed in Search Engine"
"I am a fan of the Muscle Milk Milk and Oats oatmeals by Cytosport.  The product comes in several flavors of which Banana Walnut is one.  The banana flavor was detectable but the walnut was understated.<br /><br />My preferred flavor is blueberries and cream.<br /><br />Milk and Oats is in my opinion a healthy product which delivers a good amount of protein and vitamins.  It provides a healthy start to any day.<br /><br />One caution with this product.  It took me several times making the oatmeal to make it turn out right.  It takes a little more effort than add water, stir and nuke. TL;DR Less than wonderful"
"Walmart sells this same cake mix for less than $1 per box. I expect much better from Amazon- you are ripping people off with this ""deal"" TL;DR How is this a good deal?"
"These sweet treats are really something to write home about. They are crispy, slightly sweet but enough to satisfy any sweet tooth. The blend of raisins and almonds are perfect. Just make sure you take out only a few, 2 or 3 might do it, or you will eat much more than you intended! TL;DR Absolutely wonderful!"
"Arrived on time and was exactly as pictured.  Customer service was great.  Product tasted fresh and would definitely use this company again. One con is chips were in small pieces, packing problem, still price was great and would order again. TL;DR Great Customer Service"
"I love the Stash brand tea. I love the flavors of Pomegranate, Raspberry but put them together with green tea isn't a taste I like. I figured given the fact that I love the taste of Pomegranate and Raspberries I would like this one but personally I don't like it. But just because I don't like it doesn't mean someone else wouldn't like it. It is something you should judge for yourself. TL;DR Not that great"
"The coffee comes in vaccum-sealed packages rather than in the displayed can. Apparently this affects the taste as the coffee is somewhat bitter-tasting compared to the same coffee purchased in cans from the grocery store. I guess we'll have to live with the bitter taste since we can't seem to find this particular coffee in our local stores, but we are disappointed. TL;DR Bitter Taste"
I'm glad I didn't actually gift this to someone.  The food was mediocre at best and the cutting board split right in half. TL;DR Not a good gift.
"This product isn't cheap, but it tastes good. It tastes a lot like brown sugar, in my opinion.<br /><br />I bought it to use in meals for my mother, who has been confined to bedrest and was recently diagnosed as a diabetic. So far, I have only used it to make a lower-carb poppyseed dressing for the chicken slaw she likes so much. When the weather is cool enough to bake, I'd like to make her some coconut meringues using partly this sugar, and partly something else such as Splenda or xylitol.<br /><br />My mom takes Glucophage and has had fairly good blood sugar levels when she eats reasonably, so I'm probably not the best qualified to comment as to how it could affect someone whose diabetes is more severe.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be for the company to consider going with a different bag, since the zip-close top on this doesn't work, and I'm keeping it in another bag. FYI, the carbs listed for this product are the same as regular brown sugar, although I understand different carbs metabolize differently. TL;DR I like this..."
"Notice that although the picture has 3 jars of salsa, you only get one jar of salsa.  It is not made clear in the product description, which is annoying. TL;DR do not be deceived"
My dog loves Greenies Treats and because they are good fo rher that makes them even better! TL;DR Good things!
Great cookies if you are a celiac.  best cookies I have found in a long time.  You must try them! TL;DR Great product and fast shipping
"I'd like to first say that i'm a bit obsessed with pickles.  Whenever I see a brand i haven't tried, I buy it.<br />Harold's francis cowley pickles and sissy sweet pickles are two of the best pickles i've ever eaten.  Crunchy, favorable, salty and delicious.<br />These are the Rolls Royce of pickles. Thank you! TL;DR Best pickles ever!"
It has been tradition to make coffee cake with Solo Cherry my whole life.  For some reason it is very hard to find in the grocery stores lately.  I was able to stock up with this 12 pack!  This is the best filling for coffee cake!  Perfect constancy and the cherries are not sour or tart!!! TL;DR GREAT for making coffee cake!!!
"I used to be a cook in college making eggs and pancakes for breakfast in the college dining hall.  It wasn't actually gourmet but it at least was a pancake.  I followed the directions to the letter on the box which wasn't too difficult but, like the others low rating reviews, it came out like a watery flat omelet.  It had a strong taste of eggs, it didn't rise very well.  I chucked the rest of the box out.  You might get a better result if you cut the mix with a little regular flour or add more mix than recommended on the package, but I don't think its worth the effort.  Better to just eat a normal pancake with sugar free syrup than this stuff. TL;DR Doesn't taste like a pancake."
"This tea is expensive.  Let us be honest.  But it is worth EVERY PENNY.<br /><br />WOW...and backwards...WOW.<br /><br />The flavor is amazing.  My wife and I search for a tea that tastes like the Lipton Yellow Label Tea that you get in Pakistan.  That just has such a great flavor...epsecially with Nestle Everyday (couldn't live without that creamer).  Until now, my wife usually buys Tetly, which we thought was pretty good.  For some reason, it just seemed better than the Lipton Yellow Label tea that you can purchase at international stores here in the U.S.<br /><br />But then I ordered this, and again, WOW.  There is NO comparison.  We make tea the typical Pakistani way, but for comparison purposes, we just took two cups of boiling water and put a Tetly bag in one and one of these on the other cup.  The color and smell of the Tetly seemed fine...UNTIL you look at this one, and then smell it.  This is just spot on.  I can't say enough about it.  It is more than I'd like to pay for tea, but until there's another option, this is what we'll be getting.<br /><br />Give it a shot...but make sure you get Nestle Everday, that is, if you can find it anywhere.  At best, it will be available in some International/Pakistani grocery stores.  Good luck. TL;DR Amazing...Just like if I was in Pakistan"
"Huge selling point for me is the fact that this has the super grain - salba - in it, and is doesn't have soy, wheat, dairy or gluten. Great for kids with allergies! I love that it has a screw top, so if my child doesn't finish the whole thing I can stick it in the fridge and save it for later. Highly recommend! TL;DR Great snack for kids with allergies!"
"These dried mango pieces are really, really yummy!  They are not hard or crisp, but are instead soft and chewy.  They have a very strong (but not fake) mango taste.  Plus, they are organic! TL;DR Yummy..."
"Tried this coffee based pretty much on the assumed introductory price.  I was a little skeptical about trying this product based on the reviews, due to the explosion issues.  Reviewers didn't rave on the taste too much however.  So after receiving these cups, I gave one a whirl, and had no problems brewing it.  I did notice that the box that they were packaged in could use some (might I say) environmental saving upgrades, and the box itself was a bit rough shod.  Also I examined a few of the K-cups and there seems to be a vacuum issue with them.  Some looked as if they were ready to blow up right in my hand, as they were so full of air, or whatever it is inside them, they were like a balloon that when over blown with air, it could explode in your face at any second.  The others seemed like they had no air or nitrogen or what ever inside. Cups could be squished and squeezed and the foil top would just waffle back and forth.  So that seems to be another quality control issue, with the vacuum packing and sealing process. Perhaps that may lead to the product quality itself once made in the cup.  I really don't think I have had the same consistent taste with one of these cup yet.  My first cup was rather weak, as in it tasted like I had run twice as much water through it than I should have.  Really had a watered down taste.  The following few cups weren't much different.  I am using a controlled amount of water, but the consistency of the coffee that gets filtered into the cup seemed to be all over the place.  There have been a couple of cups that seemed to be almost ""just right"" but still on the weak side, given this is supposed to be a medium roast.  I mean, I've had medium blends that taste like French Roast, but this I would really have to classify as a very light roast.<br />Too light for me, so I'm sure if I re-order, I'll try a stronger blend.<br />That being said, I think these guys at Brooklyn Roasting Co. are on the right track, and I do hope they can find a way to keep the price down.  If so, and assuming I can find the right roast for me, I might stick with them for a while.  If the price goes up, where it's tooth to tooth with the big boys, I'm afraid the big boys will win me out.<br /><br />Update 8/15/12. Well, just when I thought this problem with exploding cups was solved...BOOOOM!!! Coffee grounds everywhere!  YES, It happened to me.  *I'm trying to insert a photo, if I can figure that out. I'm pretty confident though that this will be my last purchase of these Brooklyn k cups.  It's one thing to have a passion to go after a piece of the K cup Pie, but if you can't do it right, don't do it at all.  This company (based on several buyers and reviews, even before I happened on to these ""cheaper"" cups) had plenty of chances to get it right.<br />*Apparently Amazon or this company will not allow additional photos, as I tried to post an image of the exploded cup sitting in my machine.  My guess is they would have far too many photos of the dastardly messes.<br /><br />Update 9/03/12.  Ok, Based on the fact that this company is serious about hanging in there, and making things right with their customers, I am giving these guys another ""college try"".  After the exploding cup, they very graciously sent me replacement cups.  I did not ask that they be replaced, or demanded that they redeem themselves, I merely reported the problem, along with a photo, and next thing I knew, they were asking me for more info, about the product that I had, and then told me they would send some replacements. Again, I did not solicit these, but a few days later, a very generous offering was delivered to me.  I am really excited to try out all of the other flavors now, as the sent a sample box of several different flavors.  My wife and I have already tried a couple of the new flavors and so far they were quite good.  My wife really liked the Vanilla blend, and wants me to order a box of that alone.  I had the french roast, and thought it was pretty good as well.  The cups performed nicely and I'm looking forward to trying all of the others.<br />So I suppose that as I am always willing to give things another shot, I really think that this company is truly trying to deliver a great product, and is doing the right thing by taking care of it's customers, one cup at a time.<br />The only thing I'm still a little skeptical about is the pricing seems to be creeping up, closer to that of the big brothers in the business.  I was really hoping that they could keep them below .50 cents a cup, but are already surpassing that.  Pricing will be they main drive factor for me if these cups provide consistent and equally good or better coffee to that of the original players.<br />All that being said, I'm upgrading the star factor.  Thanks Brooklyn for taking care of me.  That was unexpected, but very welcome! TL;DR Worth another try!  Update to previous reviews."
"I've been waiting for that very granola bar!  A perfect combination of dark chocolate and granola.  I had only found it in one store,I bought a lot for several weeks, came back and they hadn't restocked!  I was tres disappointed and may have to resort to buying a case, but hope I don't have to.  Thanks for the wonderful granola bar.<br /><br />Bobbie Scarborough TL;DR Delicious dark chocolate chip granola bar"
For the past several years I have been making 500 rolled sugar cookies in maple leaf shape for a Breast Cancer Survivors' Retreat.  The event is always held in Autumn (the reason for the leaf motif).  Having pink sugar sprinkled before they go into the oven makes a perfect touch for this event.  The Pink Sparkling Sugar purchased recently from Amazon.com was as painless as a purchase could be.  I will do it again. TL;DR Sugar for Cookies
"I have been really disappointed with the new Ovaltine formula. I have bought this mostly for my kids because it had an amazing amount of vitamins and minerals and tasted pretty good. I am a label reader. The new product has about one fourth of the nutritional values as before. What used to be 100% or close to it on several vitamins is now only 10%. It's a shame. They have ruined a great product. The taste is still okay, but the new formula doesn't dissolve well. It's funny that the new formula is much cheaper to make, because the price hasn't gone down at all. We are just getting a lot less for our money. TL;DR Where did the vitamins go?"
Love the flavor of vanilla and hazelnut. Very hard to find this combination in an herb tea. Very flavorful. I have been sharing with lots of friends due to the quantity I had to buy. Everyone has liked it. Definately worth giving it a try. I have gone through my first box already! TL;DR Searched high and low for this tea
"This is the best pasta if you like to replace wheat from your diet. The taste can fool you thinking you get regular pasta, very good. TL;DR Excellent wheat replacement"
"I've been using these for a while now, as I have sensitive skin and regular deodorants irritate me.<br /><br />It works well, I don't sweat as much, but the dispenser it comes in ""leaks"". How to I describe this... I keep it on my counter top, and every time I lift it to use, there is a round ring of greasy stuff under it, and you can wipe the bottom of the dispenser with a paper towel and see that this is where it is coming from.<br /><br />I can't even find a link on Dove's website to ask if I am doing something wrong.<br /><br />It is in my bathroom, not exposed to sun, or extreme heat or cold. If it didn't leak, I would give it 4 stars, but because of it, only 3 stars. I would give it 5 starts if it wasn't so pricey compared to regular, scented sticks. TL;DR Protects well, but it ""leaks"""
"So good that the cakes did not last until Christmas.  The balance of flavors was just right -- not to sweet, not too much cinnamon, and nice a gooey on top. TL;DR Good cakes!"
"Once a diet coke drinker, but then moved to a natural alternative, and have tried most brands. This one has less aftertaste than Zevia, at least the cola flavor. Its overall really good, I only wish it had caffeine like Zevia for that additional pick me up. Good Stuff, cheaper than Whole Foods if you subscribe. TL;DR Better than Zevia"
Good morning cup of coffee.  Just bold enough.good flavor.  In my top 10 of K Kups as I like variety. TL;DR good coffee
"At the time I bought Santa Fe Refrito, the idea of ""less than can"" sized portions was new to me. I would cover 7/8 of a can with plastic wrap and a rubber band. Refrito can have a high dose of sodium so I would not over do it. Santa Fe Dry refrito can be made in any size portion, in my case directly in a microwave in a 1/2 cup food storage container. Since this purchase I have noticed the availability of similar products in the bulk foods section of Fred Meyer, with even lower sodium concentrations. TL;DR Refrito in your sized portions."
"Ah last, tuna in oil, why is this so hard to find I wonder. Nice flavor. TL;DR Very good"
"This is so delicious I polished off the rest of my daughters! I love Kraft, it's tasty, but I wanted something healthier and the Annie's is a much healthier version, but taste was an 8/10. This is healthy AND delicious! I bought mine at the store, but just came on here to order a 12 pack! Yum! TL;DR YUM! Best tasting ""healthy"" mac n cheese I've tried!"
"I have used this brand of rice paper many times. It is by far my favorite. They are tasty and pretty forgiving of my clumsy efforts to roll the perfect spring roll.<br /><br />I read with dismay how a customer found ant parts cooked into a package of them. I've never seen this, and I hope that the customer notified the company. They make a good product, and I am sure that they would want to know about any problems. TL;DR Great for Spring Rolls"
"when i see the name newton i expect to taste a lot of fruit.  this product fell short of my expectations, the cranberries lack taste.  the cookie is flat and crispy and the flavor is similar to an oat ginger snap, not unpleasant, but not a cookie i would buy. TL;DR newtons tries something different"
I haven't been able to create or find a marinade as good as this one. Everybody who has had the skirt steak with this marinade has raved about it. Two thumbs up! TL;DR Bella Sun Luci Carne Asada Marinade
"My dog has a liver problem and for 3 years I have been cooking special food for her.  I wouldn't dream of ever giving her either commerial canned or  dry food again, even from the vet.  But I do trust the Paul Newman products and these cookies have not caused any problems for my dog - she loves them. And I love them because I love her so much and I want to give her treats with no additives that are dangerous for many dogs,not just those on special diets.  I wish I knew when our dog adopted us what I know now.  If I had been feeding her as I am now she probably would never have developed this liver problem. TL;DR Name you can trust"
"it taste the same, its sweet,so everything is the same so everyboby get ready lets all ""SMACK IT TO CRACK IT' AND ENJOY. TL;DR its back"
"The patties are dense and dry, not difficult to crumble up but definitely hold their shape. I tend to crumble these and add pieces on top of kibble meals for my pups occasionally as a way to keep them interested. As soon as they notice me crumbling up the patties, they start dancing! Definitely see them pick pieces of this dehydrated raw out of their bowls before they eat their kibble, so it's definitely preferred by them. The price point is too high for me to consider feeding these alone, since I've got three hungry pups. No stomach issues at all. These would be great for us to pack as a snack for pups on hikes, since they're light-weight and nutritionally dense. TL;DR Great as a way to spice up your kibble meals!"
"The chai mate has too much caffeine for me, as it is as much as a cup of coffee - although they claim it doesn't give you any jitters, for me it does. I blend this with one of their herbal (non-caffeine) chai's - the roobios is great - using a half-half ratio. The resultant mix is delicious with milk and a bit of honey - and is a great pick-me-up in mid morning. Teavana's teas also always make me feel better - each of their teas has a special ""healing"" power to it - I am not sure if it is true or not, but I do feel like I'm doing something better for my body by drinking their teas. TL;DR excellent tea, blend with herbal tea for delicious midcaffeine tea"
"Again, great in a pinch or not wanting to use many ingredients.  It tastes more like a dense brownie though and it can be pretty rich. TL;DR Brownie?"
"I ordered the wrong stuff.  I hate when that happens. I'm sure some people like it, but it's not for me... Plus I can buy it in the stores and not have to pay shipping! Ouch. But it arrived within days, packed the way it should be.  I can't complain about the service! TL;DR Anybody want to buy 5 bottles of Kraft creamy Italian?"
I like the Signature blend but have noticed the flavor is a bit different now when compaing it to previous purchases.  I added a touch of splenda to sweeten it ever so slightly and it was great.  I made a Red Eye (coffee with a shot of espresso) this morning as I was leaving the house and it tasted good.  I like slightly sweeter coffee but appreciate the opportunity to decide how sweet it needs to be.  I hate nothing more than overly sweet coffee.  I like this but know I need to add a packet or two of splenda to get it just right. TL;DR Good
"It is virtually impossible to find cereals on grocery shelves which have ""no sugar"" (and ""no high fructose corn syrup"").  I stumbled across this one and of course came to Amazon.com to see if it was available here.  Once again, I am very happy to find what I am looking for to be so convenient.  I also enjoy the auto-ship with reduced product cost and no shipping on other products and I will go that route on this one as well.  My only regret is that multiple boxes need to be purchased at one time.  I would appreciate the option of being able to order a single box rather than 6 at a time since I am the only one who eats this cereal at our house.  Maybe I can convince my husband of this healthier option now that Amazon makes it affordable!!  Thank you Amazon, for your wide variety and excellent prices... and the auto-ship program! TL;DR Meets my needs"
"Dr. Brad Watkins and I agree - this is the tastiest coffee you can buy for the Melitta One. Dr. Ghani may point out that caffeine interferes with weight loss, but there's time you gotta have your cuppa joe...  A Synchrony Health recommendation. TL;DR Best coffee for the Melitta One and Juan Valdez pod coffee makers!"
found this to be excellent tea.  I drink with milk and a little sugar. those who think too strong may be tea only drinkers. TL;DR very good
"I have ordered this tea from Amazon multiple times. I just can't find the Bigelow Earl Grey kcups anywhere local. That's fine though, because they get it delivered so fast! I just got another shipment yesterday and it only took two days. I ordered it late Sunday night and it was on my doorstep by Tuesday at noon. That's 48 k-cups for about $20. Not bad at all!<br />I can find twinings earl grey locally at a store, but it's just not as good as the Bigelow Brand! Love this stuff! TL;DR Great Tea, Fast Delivery"
"After getting a few tiny pieces of chocolate covered toffee in a candy assortment, I fell in love with the buttery, almost smokey-coffee taste of crisp toffee thinly slathered in chocolate.  Looking for a replacement, I discovered SKOR bars at the drug store - perfect!  A nice size bar so I can get my chocolate-toffee fix, and not just a few tiny pieces. SKOR has just the right amount of chocolate to toffee ratio - very tasty and enjoyable.  When my current stash is consumed I'll be getting these by the box through Amazon.<br />Hershey chocolate is not my favorite, and I am fussy about my candy, but SKOR bars are delectable. TL;DR Sinfully delicious"
"The pepper is great and the grinder is easy to operate.  I did get the pack of six for less than ten bucks, which was quite a bargain.  I see now that it costs a lot more so keep your eye on the price. TL;DR Great value"
"I am constantly on the search for healthy shelf stable snacks to send to my friends when they are deployed.  This was a hit.  No added sugars or corn syrup, just pureed dehydrated fruit leather.  This was much appreciated, and they are already begging for more! TL;DR Splendid!!! Perfect to send for soldiers!"
Sweet BBQ taste. A bit of salty. A bit of pepper. NOT dry. This product does not disappoint. I thought it would taste like an old piece of pork... You know that flavor. But nope...this is a wonderful snack when chips are not an option. High protein. Low carb/fat. Breakfast of Champions! Great for low carb diets. TL;DR Pure Nomness. And not Porky Tasting. Great for Low Carb Diets!
Love the cinnamon flavor of this gum and it actually lasts longer than most gums.  I LOVE the fact that it doesn't upset my stomach and make me bloated like regular sugarless gums.  I am just reordering my 2nd tub. TL;DR No more upset tummy!
"I saw these when they first came out so I decided to buy a box. Unfortunately I didn't realize they also make a crunchy version and I grabbed that box by accident. While both are good, I'm a big fan of the chewy cookies. I love oatmeal, but it's not very portable. These are a great cookie to snack on during the mornings or afternoon. TL;DR Delish"
These are disgustingly good. Full flavor and enough sour to get you really drooling. Try to eat only one or two - I guarantee it can't be done. Box comes with two 5-pound ziploc bags so they stay fresh. That's not actually a problem because after opening they don't stick around very long. Made the mistake of filling up my candy jar at work. I had people I didn't even know stopping by to snag a handful. They are made by Jelly Belly which basically says it all. TL;DR Wish they came in a 20 pound size
"We have two cats and one has very long hair and of course after cleaning themselves they get hairballs. We tried several hairball control treats and these are the one our cats seem to prefer. I purchase one case every six months,giving the long hair cat 10 each day and the short hair cat 5 each day, and they do help to control the frequency of the barfing. They always arrive quickly and we will continue to purchase them from amazon. The long hair cat likes them sooo much he greets me each morning and bugs me until he get his whiskas. TL;DR Prevent barfing"
"I got these for our new Kuerig at work.  I like a bold roast and the office communal choice has proven to be flavored junk.  So, I decided to get my own stash.  I am a fan of Coffee People, so seeing the had K-cups I went for it.  I read the reviews for Jet Fuel and the Bold blend and settled on Jet Fuel.  Glad I did!  It has a strong flavor, but is not bitter or acidic.  It definitely does the trick in the morning. TL;DR great bold roast"
"I was recently in Haiti on a mission.  We worked all day in the hot, humid weather.  This stuff kept us going.  It was worth every penny. TL;DR Great Stuff"
"The packages as shown contain 9 individually wrapped drops that look like cough drops. The list of ingredients includes sugar, corn syrup, honey, trace amounts of vitamin A and vitamins B6-0.66mg, B12-2mg, and C-20mg each at what is claimed to be 33% of the recommended daily dosage; three drops providing then the listed minimum requirement. The drops contain no protein, no sodium, no fat, and no fiber<br /><br />The amounts of vitamins C and B6 are so minimal as to be hardly worth mentioning; the amount of B12 is phenomenal if their information is correct. The DV for vitamin B12 is 2.4 mcg daily and the label claims 2mg or 2,000 mcg per drop or 6mg or 6,000 mcg with three drops. I suspect there's a typo there and it should read 2mcg, not 2mg since B12 is usually measured in mcg.<br /><br />In summary the drops are small and convenient, but expensive. If the B12 value is correct it has huge quantities of that B vitamin; other than that the cost is hard to justify. TL;DR Individually Wrapped Drops with a Sweet Taste"
"I have always preferred tea for my morning beverage and I like it quite strong, with milk, no sugar--it's a family thing; my grandmother's family was Canadian.  Welsh Brew is the first tea I have found (since Red Rose was bought out by Lipton) that tastes even better than Red Rose used to.  The tea bags are a decent size and the tea, even when strong, is nicely mellow  without any bitterness. When it is brewed strong there is a nice tannic base but again, without the bitterness of a (all) black tea.  It has to be the combination of black and orange pekoe teas in Welsh Brew that makes it so.  RR has gone-in the American market, at least--to an all black tea formulation.  I first bought Welsh Brew at a gourmet shop while on vacation and I liked it so much that I had to locate a more convenient source: the four-pack from Amazon is perfect...enough tea to keep me going for quite a while; I probably drink at least two, if not more, cups of tea a day. TL;DR Possibly the best..."
this is my flavorite flavor i use this for rock candy for christmas for my grand children they lkove it TL;DR lorann clove oil
Veggie booty is a nice snack with healthy vegetable ingredients.  It arrived fresh with plenty of time before expiration. TL;DR Veggie Booty is Good Stuff
"Product was as described. Angry bird pouches were sealed in box but when I counted for total of 48, we only had 45. Was counting on full amount for goody bags. Now we will be short. :(  other than that shipped promptly and package was in great condition. TL;DR angry over shortage"
"I really liked the ingredients of this drink and the taste reminds me of the tropical islands.  The mango taste is strong and flavorful and the shot is easy to take in the morning for a great way to start the day.  The drink is thick and almost smoothie like, but has a great tropical taste.  It gave me a little energy to start the day and had a refreshing taste. TL;DR Tropical Energy"
I took a chance with this product (even though there weren't enough good reviews) since they are cheaper than 5 hour energy.  They did not work for me so I tried Red Rain which did work and was even cheaper.  Red Rain DID work for me so I am done with 5 hour energy and 6 hour power. The ingredients are pretty close to 5 hour energy but someone is lying since it doesn't work. TL;DR Didn't make the cut
"I ordered this coffee because of all the positive reviews for these pods.  I have tried making coffee from the pods, and I have found ALL of it undrinkable. My goal was to make a medium-sized mug of coffee.  With one pod, the coffee was way too weak.  I then tried two pods, and the coffee was still not strong enough.  It lacked flavor, and I found it very flat.  (For sake of reference, I like medium strength coffee.  Starbucks Coffee, for example, is too strong for me.)  Regardless, I managed to squeeze 3 pods into my coffee maker, but the coffee was now horrible.  Ok, so I thought, let's go back to 2 pods and vary the amount of water.  After some experimentation, I found that 2 pods and 10 oz. of water gave the proper strength for my taste.  However, nothing could help the flavor.  I detested the flat, stale taste. Do yourself a favor - skip this product.  Now I know why the pods are relatively cheap - you get what you pay for. I'm not a coffee gourmet, but this coffee is worst than the over-boiled stuff that is left at the end of the day in the office coffee pot. TL;DR I Threw It Away"
"They were once produced in York, PA, but that was a long time ago.  Now they're from Monterrey Mexico.  Same great taste?  Who knows.  I hadn't had any for years until I wolfed my way through one of these boxes.  They taste good enough, but I'll never know if they were like the originals from York.  Why does something like this need to be imported? TL;DR They're Monterrey Mints now!"
"At my local market, they sell this fragrant, nutty, excellent tea for $1.99 a box! $4.99 a box is highway robbery! Shop around! TL;DR Excellent tea! but this price is a rip-off..."
"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are better than any homemade cookies I have tried or made. Which says alot considering I'm a former baker. They are so soft and tasty, even my 8 year loved this cookie and she hates oatmeal. I highly recommend these cookies. They're especially great for on the go snacks.Also the price is very reasonable considering the quality you get. So if you're a cookie fan this one you have to try, you won't be disappointed. TL;DR Better Than Homemade!"
"My dog has never been willing to play with toys, or chew on things he couldn't just eat (i.e. food items that he is given. That is, until we lucked out and found the Kong Busy Buddy (large). He loves the darn thing. His face lights up, his tail starts wagging, he opens his mouth wide, grabs his offered Busy Buddy, and goes to town. It's some work to get to the treats and he seems to enjoy working the bone as much as eating the treat. We have actually bought several of these - for two reasons - one for when we travel, and one home, one for vacation. It is expensive, I'll admit, but for the delight it brings him, I'd have to say it is well worth it. Don't expect it to last very long (not the treats - which are gone pretty fast regardless, but the Busy Bone itself - if your dog has a strong jaw, it will eventually start showing serious wear, and the bristle may start wearing off). You can control that by keeping an eye on your dog and removing the Busy Buddy when the treat is gone and he's just chewing on it, but frankly, I don't have the heart. I'm happy to let him have his way with his Busy Buddy, and replace it once in a while. Bet your dog loves it too! TL;DR Best Dog Toy/Chewy/Snack EVER!!"
"I needed a half-caff coffee to use in my Keurig to get me thru the afternoon (but not keep me up all night).  This coffee does do the job.<br /><br />The only negative is a matter of my own taste.  I MUCH prefer dark roasted coffee, and this is definitely light-to-medium.  Tastes like Denny's coffee.  Just fine, not earth-shattering...<br /><br />My very favorite K-cup coffee is Obsidian (by Caribou) - to get a sense of what I wished it tasted like! TL;DR Perfectly fine"
"I did a head-to-head comparison between this product and the competing Carroll Shelby kit; Wick Fowler came out ahead by a significant margin. WF had a deeper red color and more ""three dimensional"" flavor, whereas the CS was more brown and tasted mostly of cumin (smoky) instead of the full flavor of WF. I'd definitely recommend using beer instead of some of the water; I also add a can of tomatoes when I make it. The only downside to this particular deal is that Amazon's price is higher than my local store, but if it's not available locally to you, this would be a good buy. TL;DR Very good for a quick bowl of red"
"I'm trying to cut sugar out of my diet and more importantly, I'm getting rid of Aspartame.  That stuff is a neurotoxin and I'm suffering from some of the long-term health effects of that poison.  I had high hopes for beverages using the new Stevia extract and tried the Other brand with the Stevia ingredient.  The other brand is a little pricey, so I thought I would try this one too. The other brand, outside of the price was a very pleasant experience.  Keeping in mind that this is the only flavor I tried of this brand,  I can't comment on the Blue Sky brand as a whole, but in this one instance, I have to say it sucks.  The initial taste in unpalatable and the after-taste is even worse.  I tried six cans over the course of a week (hoping my taste would acclimate)  and ended up pouring the rest down the drain.  It doesn't taste like a beverage.  I'm not sure what the taste reminds me of, but I definitely cant drink it.  Sorry for the harsh review, but this stuff is awful. TL;DR OMG"
"I've tried more expensive vanillas, and I've found this brand to be just as good as any others I've tried.  I bought once from Amazon, then realized my local Costco sells this for half the price, around $6 rather than the $12 I paid here. TL;DR Quality vanilla, better price from the warehouse"
Absolutely love the depth of flavor of this product.  Great with or with out milk and sugar. TL;DR Frickin' Tasty
"As the title indicates -- I have a mixed experience with this cat food.  On the plus side, it doesn't smell to high heaven, and, when the cats actually eat it,  their tummies don't go into reverse and urp it up.  But -- this is the one canned cat food my street cat from Tajikistan doesn't like, and will pick at it only after he gives up on screeching for something else.  My other cat was also a rescue, and he normally treats every mouthful of food as if it might be his last.  Even he walks away from this with half of it uneaten. I was frankly amazed -- these two cats really will eat anything, or so I thought.  It's certainly a high quality cat food -- and maybe the lack of a strong odor has something to do with their disdain.  Conversely, they both inhale any flavor of the Tiki Cat food. TL;DR Mixed Review"
"My baby develop terrible gas pains at month 2.  I read one of the reviews that it would be good to brew water with the chamomile tea before mixing formula.  I followed through, and end up solving my baby's gas problem. TL;DR Good to mix with baby formula"
This is the second time I order this product.  My dog loves it.....since she is a heavy dog (english bulldog).  This food keeps her on a healthy diet.  Love it. TL;DR Great product
"The first time I tried these, they were absolutely amazing. The fig-center was slightly gooey, and the cookie was soft. It brought back memories of the gluten-filled fig newtons I had given up 3 years before. I bought a box a few months later, and was sorely disappointed. The fig-center was more like a gelatin rather than gooey and the cookie crumbled with the slightest touch. The only thing I can figure is that the first batch I tried must've been incredibly fresh. I've bought a couple of boxes since then hoping for one that tasted as fresh, but I haven't had any as good as the first one.<br />I like that they're packaged in twos for easy grab-and-go snacks and for portion control. I just have to be careful not to squish the packs in my bag...crumbled cookies! I also like the sweetness of the fig-center, but the oustide cookie part really doesn't have much flavor. TL;DR For Some Reason, I Keep Coming Back For More..."
I love the home baked mom taste these have! Just like my mom made them! They are also easy to find and affordable! TL;DR So soft and chewy!
"Throw a few in your diaper bag in case of emergency and you don't have to worry about space issues or worry about trying to measure out formula in preparation for a long outing.  Like others, I use this to supplement so this is also fabulous for those onesie/twosie feedings that come up when I can't nurse - without having to buy a can of powder.  I got hooked on these when they sent me samples in the mail. TL;DR Wonderful!!"
These are the best Altoids.  Difficult to get in the stores but as long as I can get them at Amazon I am a happy camper.<br /><br />Last week I took several boxes with me on my trip to China and I now I have them hooked on the liquorice flavor.  On my next trip they asked me to bring a case for them. TL;DR Best Altoids
"Great protein and B12 supplement. Tastes great and can be used on salads, smoothies, popcorn and more. TL;DR Awesome supplement for vegetarians"
"I've been enjoying this tea for a few years now, ever since it first came out. I've always purchased it at my local grocery store but both stores that I could buy it from stopped selling it!!! I found it here on Amazon and couldn't be happier. Now I order in bulk and enjoy it everyday! It is the best tasting vanilla tea that I have found and I have tried many!!! TL;DR Best tasting vanilla tea!"
The smooth strawberry flavored Ghirardelli chocolate and crisp popcorn makes this treat irresistible. My order arrived fast and the popcorn tasted fresh. This treat is so good you may wish you had ordered two bags. I definitely will next time I order. This is the best flavored popcorn I've ever tasted in this lifetime.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review TL;DR Strawberry and Cream Crunch
"Been a major Altoids fan for years, but when Ginger Altoids showed up it became my instant favorite -- of course, those precious tins almost immediately became harder and harder to find until it's now virtually impossible to walk into a store and pick up a new supply.  [...] to the rescue!!!  Not only are they available, but the price is right and the service as good as always. TL;DR Best of the best"
"Not as good as my homemade, but sure saves time when in a hurry.  They taste good, not overseasoned, recipe doesn't need adjusting.  Go for it! TL;DR Pretty tasty - easy;"
"This is a great value lapsang souchong tea. It has a good smoky flavor and aroma - not too strong but not too weak. I was a bit skeptical about the cheaper price, but I must say it was more than worth it. I drink it daily and will purchase it again when my bag is gone. TL;DR Great value"
"Stash has good green tea's but personally i wasn't impressed with Irish Black Tea. It is weak compared to other's i have tried like Yorkshire or Twinings. This one is not acidic or bad tasting as Lipton but just not full bodied or flavor. TL;DR Not full bodied as Twining Irish, Won't buy again"
"This is the BEST soft mint candy.  I bought it for the firest time at Christmas, had a hard time finding it anywhere in the stores so decided to see if Amazon might have it and there is was.  So soft, sweet and flavorful..I highly recommend it! TL;DR Soft Mint Candy"
"has a decent taste to it.  Its extrememly fine, like a powder.  i dusted my ribs with it liberally but I had a difficult time keeping the rub on the ribs as they heated up.. it just kinda puddled off while the ribs came up to temperature. I'm telling ya its fine like flour.  its definitely different.. and has  a bright red color b/c of the extra paprika. TL;DR powdery but decent"
"Once I received these in the mail, the dogs went nuts!  I have two boxers and a yellow lab, who are avid chewers, and I needed something that would last.  The rawhides give them loose stools, so I was searching for something that wouldn't upset their G.I. tracts.  Overall, they have lasted quite some time without damaging the teeth as the nylabones have been doing.  Being in the vet business previously for 12 years, I would highly recommend these for the hearty chewers.  Make sure you obtain the proper size for your breed (I ordered the 3 large for my guys who are 50, 70, & 80 lbs).  They do not seem to splinter while chewing, but I would not leave the dogs to chew on them unsupervised to reduce the possible hazard of choking.  The vendor also shipped the items out in a timely manner, and compared to the other antlers on the market, I believe that the price was very reasonable. TL;DR Dogs love 'em!"
"I bought one box of these, thinking they would be a lot like the old Sunshine Lemon Coolers cookies.  They are DEFINITELY not them.  No tangy lemon flavor in the powdered sugar.  Though the box says, ""COOLER THAN EVER!"", they don't have that cool sensation like the originals had.<br /><br />The smell is the same, the look is the same, the texture is the same...but the taste doesn't measure up at all, if you're looking for a substitute for Lemon Coolers. :( TL;DR NOT the old Lemon Coolers"
"Veggie Booty is very yummy.  Both my toddler and I love it, and snack on it regularly.  I'm thrilled to see it's available in 1 oz bags - that is the perfect serving size, and this way it can't get stale.  (Um... and it will help me control my serving size.)  1 oz counts as 1 starch and 1 fat if you are tracking your food exchanges.  It is crispy, flavorful, a tiny bit salty, and really addictive.  It has a high vitamin A content too.  It's a winner!! TL;DR This stuff ROCKS!"
"I have been using this product for the past couple of years and really enjoy it.  I highly recommend it for diabetics like myself.  However, I can purchase 6 of these at Walmart for under $30.00 (when on sale even less than $25.00).  Amazon needs to find a less expensive supplier for this particular product. TL;DR Excellent product but overpriced here"
"These stay very white and taste very good, unlike some white chocolate products. Does melt a little thick, but not too thick you can't do anything with it. TL;DR super white and super yummy!"
Delicious as a substitute for regular molasses and honey.  Amazon is a great place to find products that aren't carried locally. TL;DR Delicious
"Mallomars cookies are pretty yummy - a slightly spicy cookie base, with fluffy marshmallow on top, covered with dark chocolate. I've never been a great fan of smores, but I gave a cookie to one of my son's friends, who said it tasted just like a smore. Although she wasn't that keen on the after taste (she's not a fan of dark chocolate).<br /><br />My only complaint (and the reason for the 4 stars) is that the entire contents of the package arrived broken/smashed. Clearly the packaging provided by Amazon to protect it in transit was insufficient for the rigors of transit.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'd highly recommend these cookies :) TL;DR Yummy!"
This coffee is made across  the passage from me.  Much better price than I can get locally.  I am normally a French roast drinker and I find this coffee a little less complex and not as rich as I normally drink. However many will enjoy it as it is definitely a premium coffee.  I hope to try their one of their other blends once I am through this five pounds. TL;DR Good but one dimensional
This has always been my favorite coffee cremor!  Makes my coffee smooth and delicious! TL;DR coffe mate
"If you love mint, then you will like this tea.  If you only like mint as an added flavor note, then this may be a bit too intense for you.  I enjoyed the flavor.  I had not had mint tea before, but I love lots of different teas.  I was surprised at how much it reminded me of eating food with chewing gum in your mouth if you eat anything with it.  I like mine sweet and it isn't bad with lemon if you like it that way.  The mint is dominant and strong, so it may not be suited to all tastes.  I didn't really get an energy burst from it, so I can't really comment on how that feels.  I probably wouldn't regularly buy it, but it isn't bad.  If you like mint, give it a try. TL;DR Very minty!"
"We go through an unhealthy level of this stuff in my house so Amazon carrying it in 12pks at a price cheaper than going to the store is perfect. If you like spicy food the hot version is just right for you. Now, everyone I talk to doesn't seem to grasp how versatile Rotel is and thinks it's just for mixing with Velveeta and making queso dip with. How very wrong they are! (although that is a great use of it as well) Here's some of the things we regularly do with Rotel:<br /><br />~Add to a grilled chicken/turkey/chicken/etc and cheese quesadilla<br />~Add to spaghetti sauce<br />~Add a can to taco meat as the liquid portion when you add the seasoning<br />~Use to make salsa<br />~I use a can (along with broth) as part of the soup base when I make spicy chicken noodle soup<br />~Use to make spicy tomato baked mac and cheese (or simply add some to a box of Kraft, it's delicious)<br /><br />Really anything you'd normally enjoy tomatoes with Rotel works great for and adds a spicy kick. TL;DR Beautiful in every way"
"We are a gluten free household and everyone, right down to our almost 2 year old enjoys Honey-nut Chex.  They are just sweet enough and stay crisp in milk.  The Amazon S&S price currently beats Walmart but as always that could change so do the math for yourself. TL;DR Good choice for gluten free"
"We live in a rural area, where we are unable to buy the only dog food (Evo Herring and Salmon) my allergic-to-everything-in-most-dry-dog-foods-dogs can eat. We had been ordering their food through another wholesale supplier, but despite being on auto-ship, did not receive their last two food orders b/c they were out of stock. Panicked, I turned to Amazon, and ordered from J-B Wholesale Pet Supplies Inc. Not only was the price much cheaper than what I had been paying for their food (by $20), they got it to my door within four days (and I had been thinking that since it was ground shipping, I wouldn't see it until late next week, meaning my dogs would have been eating rice and potatoes, respectively). Thank you so much, J-B Wholesalers :)<br /><br />Per the product itself: This particular formula of Evo has been working out very well for my dogs, and we have tried ALL of the grain free dog food on the market over the past four years. My dogs have serious allergies to almost everything, and different things, too, which means it's hard to find a food both can eat. I appreciate that this formula uses peas as the carbohydrate source, since one of my dogs is allergic to rice and the other to potatoes; I also appreciate that this formula has neither flaxseed oil nor chicken fat, as both dogs are allergic to flaxseed, and one dog was getting pre-bloat symptoms from other allergy formulas that contain chicken fat, despite restricting activity for hours before and after eating and slowing down his intake :-) He hasn't had any symptoms since we switched to Evo, and both dogs LOVE this food. Granted, Labs will eat any food, but this one seems to be their favorite. TL;DR Very happy!"
"Since there were six bars in this review package I gave half of them to the front office where I work and asked what they thought. A surprising number -- more than half -- said things like ""Icky"", ""Too Bitter for Semi-Sweet"", ""Weird after taste"".  Some thought it was OK, but not great. But the very few who liked it (including me) liked it a lot.  It has a strong chocolate taste, but is far more bitter than most 62% Cacao dark bars.  It has a waxy quality, but seems all natural when you read the ingredient list. It also appears to be lower calorie than other bars of the same Cacao content.  Bottom line is this - you can beat the price and taste at Trader Joes, so for most it's not worth going out of your way for, but the unique blend of flavors will make it something you are unlikely to be ambivilant about. You'll either love it or hate it, so try it and see where you fall. If you do not like true chocolate flavor (in other words, you prefer Cacao butter and cream, milk chocolate, over dark) don't bother with this. If you do, this bar is more bitter than sweet. TL;DR Not For Everyone"
"We recently started a low carb life style and needed a<br />sugar replacement for our occasional sweet craving.  After trying<br />quite a few, this one is our favorite. TL;DR Great sugar replacement"
"Hard to find this vanilla flavor.... wish I could find it in regular grocery stores again. I LOVE it in coffee instead of sugar, less calories and good tasting. Now if it could just get a bit cheaper. A local Mexican grocery store sometimes carries this which is cheaper than sending for it via internet.... but I'm glad they have this for my backup. I think the flavor is a 5 star but the cost dropped it to a 4 star. TL;DR Nesquik vanilla powder"
"I haven't figured out how they got this granola to taste so strongly of chocolate. It doesn't LOOK that chocolate except for the little chocolate squares peppered into the granola here and there, but if I close my eyes and munch on it dry, I get somewhat of the chewiness and taste of brownie pieces. As a product to buy and eat, I like it. The only thing they could do to make it better is to add just a little more raspberry bits into it, because those are really good. I rate this a solid 4 stars for yumminess.<br /><br />What rates the five stars is the story and the heart behind the product. Certified organic and GMO-free, plus for every bag of Love Crunch you buy, Nature's Path will donate an equal amount to food banks in food or cash, up to a million dollars. I appreciate companies that care about the world they do business in. TL;DR Surprisingly chocolatey"
"I received ONE TINY BAG of 30 treats instead of 7.8 pounds (30 bags.) There must be a glitch because after reporting it twice, it still hasn't been corrected. TL;DR **BEWARE ITEM IS ONLY 3.5 OUNCES***"
I love the coffee and was looking to get a good deal on Amazon. My local supermarket sells the coffee for $6.99 for a 12 oz bag. Why can't Amazon put together a better deal? TL;DR Good Price(?)
"I have celiac disease and must avoid gluten.  Cream of Rice is one of my favorite gluten-free hot cereals, but I have a hard time finding it in local stores so I was really happy to find it here on Amazon and for such a great price! TL;DR So glad Amazon carries this!"
"I bought these to avoid the artificial sweeteners normally in gum. That's good and the flavor is ok initially, but I guess I'm so used to normal tasting gum that I couldn't get into it. It lost it's ""flavor"" about 5 minutes into chewing and then it was just a chewing blob. I bought the pack of 12 but only really used 1 pack and tossed the rest after it sat for months. I could see the benefit if you're introducing your child to gum and they have no prior taste from other gum. Personally, not my cup of tea! TL;DR Healthy but boring"
"I've been drinking Ravens Brew coffee since 1993 when someone on the docks in Ketchikan told me to try it.  I'm proud to say I was one of their first mail order customers when I had them mail it to me in Kansas.  Their coffee is smooth, not burnt tasting, and obviously made with love and care.  The packaging is thoughtful and hysterical (three pecker billygoat for example).  The graphics are beautiful (I even have a poster of the original Ravens Brew raven coming out of the coffee cup).  I saw a review on here about fraudulent posts.  I think that is just plain weird.  I have been to their roastery, I'm a real person, and I think this coffee is amazing.  So hey old sour-berry guy -- get over it and have a cup of ravensbrew to soothe your bitter soul.  Try this coffee, but be aware that you will be hooked on it.  As they say on the packaging: ""It's the last legal high"".  :)  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041FACTO"">Raven's Brew Whole Bean Organic Ebony Pearl, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a> TL;DR Great coffee!!!  Cool packaging!  Been drinking it since 1993!"
"My first reaction to these when I opened the pack was ""Wow, they smell good enough to eat!""  I'm not sure that matters, since some of my dogs' favorite treats smell like something I don't even want to touch (check out their most favorite sometime, Icelandic fish skins -- ick! I have to face the bag away from me when I open it.)  Nevertheless, it moved the Newman's Own treats up a notch in my own preferences.<br /><br />Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I have to confess that I have Cardigan Welsh Corgis, a breed infamous for its hearty and undiscriminating appetite.  Having said that, they loved these treats.  They found it hard to sit still to get one (standard house rules) because they had to wiggle and wag and be all-over excited about them.<br /><br />Each bag contains only 10 ounces of treats, which does make them expensive, but good ingredients never come cheap (if price is your only deciding factor, brace yourself before you go look at those fish skins).  Given the healthy ingredients and my dogs' reaction to them, I would certainly buy them again. TL;DR Healthy and apparently tasty"
This is for someone who wants all the flavor without all the caffeine.  I thought it was great!  Would definitely recommend. TL;DR Green Mountain Half/Half K-Cup Review
"The cookies arrived intact--none of the boxes I've opened so far had even one cracked cookie. The 12 boxes were packed snuggly into a medium box, which makes for easy storage in the basement pantry (as opposed to the usual gigantic box from Amazon with tons of paper).<br /><br />These cookies are really good, especially with coffee. They have a buttery flavor, and they're not too sweet. I originally bought them for my daughter--she loves them. But I really like them too. TL;DR Good packaging, great cookies"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JSQDGS"">Taj Mahal Tea 450g</a><br />Last fall I had opportunity to travel to Assam, India.  While there, I purchased several boxes of this Brooke Bond TAJ MAHAL tea....in both the bags and the loose tea.  I must say that this is truly the BEST tea to ever pass through my lips in my entire life!  And while the bags were convenient, truthfully, I prefer the loose tea.  It doesn't take much to make a beautiful pot of tea ~ hot or cold! TL;DR Brooke Bond Taj Mahal Tea"
"PORT SALUT ABBEY is truly scrumptious cheese! (Yum!).  I first got acquainted with Port Salut cheese years ago, when I was a member of ""CheeseLovers International"".  There, I not only bought delicious cheeses, but also became familiar with the term ""tyrophile"", which means ""cheese-lover"".  That certainly is one very accurate description of me!<br /><br />I not only became acquainted with Port Salut cheese, but also Royal Harvarti cheese -- both for the first time, via C.I.  I've had other Havarti cheese since, (no ""royal Harvarti"" could I find) -- and found it not to be as good as the Royal Havarti from the CheeseLovers International club.  However, this PORT SALUT ABBEY is every bit as good as the Port Salut I got from C.I. -- and even better!<br /><br />Although Port Salut does not list ""wine"" as one of its ingredients, it does have the slight, but distinctive taste of port wine.  ""Wispride"" and other cheese spreads have a port-wine version....and, though the winey flavour in Port Salut cheese is definitely present, (even without any wine being listed in the ingredients), it is much less strong than in the Wispride, or other port-wine cheese spread varieties.<br /><br />Slightly sweet, with tiniest hint of an egg-creme taste, (again, without egg-cream being listed on the label), Port Salut is a superb cheese for any and all occasions!<br /><br />This Port Salut Abbey Cheese was even better than the Port Salut cheese I bought from Cheeselovers International, because it was much creamier --and probably fresher, as well.<br /><br />I give this cheese only four stars, (although the TASTE merits ten -- if not 196 stars.  That's one for each year since Port Salut was invented, according to the label, which says, ""Depuis 1819"", for this French-made, pasteurized cheese.<br /><br />The reason for only four stars is this: The weight of this cheese is listed as 5 pounds here on Amazon.  The carton it comes in, (wonderfully sdecure, and also wonderfully easy to open! : ) says it weighs 4.99 pounds.  However, on the cheese itself, the weight is listed as only 4 3/4 pounds!  This prompts a rhyme from me,<br />that goes:  ""Nibble?  Who is nibbling, please?  Don't take ounces off my cheese?""<br /><br />This is NOT to infer that any entity, (mouse, human, or whatever), has been ""nibbling"" at this cheese -- only to wonder at the short-weighing of this cheese.  In these days of high food prices, (and higher shipping rates), every ounce counts!<br /><br />I bought the 5 pound wheel, (or what I thought was a 5 pound wheel), precisely because of the higher shipping rates for smaller wheels.  In fact, I bought THREE 5-pound wheels for this very reason: Three-five pound wheels, (with shipping costs), bring the price down from approximately $17 per pound, to $14 per pound.<br />Of course, this has to be recalculated if the wheel is not 5 pounds, but only 4 and 3/4 pounds.  Still, this is a LOT better than the one-pound wheel, which, with shippping costs, comes out to an astonishing $23.00 a pound!<br /><br />Today, people are looking for bargains -- even in luxury goods.  (At least I am.)<br />I have, in fact, put a 15 pound wheel of Swiss cheese on my wish list.  It is not presently available, and perhaps never will be...but I have cast my vote here, for buying in bulk and saving money!  I see here that only four more 5-pound wheels are presently available -- and hope, fervently, that this does not mean the end of the 5-pound, (or even 4 3/4 pound), wheel!  Fourteen dollars a pound is a lot to pay -- but compared to $23 a pound, it is a positive bargain!  I respectfully suggest that five-pound wheels continue to be sold, for economy's -- (and sales!) -- sake(s).  Perhaps to make this delicious cheese even more tempting, a SLIGHTLY higher price could be charged for buying 5 1-pound wheels, together. Slightly higher than the price for a whole 5 pound wheel -- but much less, hopefully, than five one-poound wheels bought singly.<br /><br />This is truly SCRUMPTIOUS cheese.  For those who do not drink wine, (or who do not want to drink wine every time they eat this cheese....yet DO want something to drink with it), I would like to suggest drinking BLACK TEA, or COLA with it!  The<br />Tea -- and especially Cola -- might seem to be slightly, er....plebian...when drunk with this gourmet cheese.  But remember, no one is really ""above it all"",<br />that just about EVERYONE has eaten fast-food fare, that ""nice guys"" not only usually win, but also sleep better at night, that ""being one of the people"" is guaranteed to win more votes......and that cheese -- any cheese -- tastes quite GOOD when accompanied by drinking tea and/or cola!<br /><br />Eating Port Salut cheese is something everyone should have a chance to do -- even if only once in their lives.  Bon Appetite!  : ), TL;DR W O U L D .....B E.....1 0.....S T A R S......I F......"
"Instead of that 2nd cup of coffee or that cup in the afternoon, switch to a cup of Jasmine tea. Coffee has it's good benefits but Jasmine tea treats your body with the extra benefit to detox, sparks a bit of serotonin and yet you get a boost of caffeine if that's the point of the 2nd cup of coffee. Hot or cold. It's good! Very little ""dust"" and that's at the very bottom of the pkg. Price and quality are a good match! If it's still available, I'll buy it again, and again when I run low. TL;DR price & quality, a good match"
"I ordered 4 bottles of joop so i could get free ups shipping.They were short one bottle but did not penalize me and i still received free ups and i do appreciate that.I also saved over $60.00.<br />  Joe Nardone<br />  Burbank,Illinois TL;DR Saving Money"
"Discontinued at local stores, I found them at Amazon for the same price. Sardines are a bit spicy but fresh and delicious. TL;DR Vigo spicy sardines"
Juice is the first ingrediant not peaches or rice. My son didnt like it. It smells and tastes aweful. Not what a peach should tadte like. TL;DR Juice?
"I am giving this 5 stars based upon my wife's feedback (I would have given it 4 stars on my own). I am not a huge fan of French Roast (dark seems redundant based upon my experience with other French Roasts &lt;g>). I do like dark roasts, but French Roast tends to be a little too strong for my tastes, however, my wife loved the flavor.<br /><br />The selling point seems to be the low acid, I cannot say one way or the other as to the effect on heartburn, even though I do occasionally get heartburn, it usually isn't associated with coffee drinking coffee, so the fact that I did not experience it after drinking 2-3 cups of this coffee is not conclusive regarding lower acid.<br /><br />Bottom line, for those that love a really rich, strong flavored coffee that may or may not reduce you incidence of heartburn associated with coffee drinking, this seems like a possible choice, certainly worth a try if you have actually stopped drinking coffee due to heartburn. P-) TL;DR Based upon my wife's feedback"
"What more can I say? All the items were in great condition, tasted delicious, and made a great meal. I would highly recommend this product. TL;DR Loved it!"
"Great product, well-liked by everyone who has tried it whilst visiting us. Now we have care package requests for it from family overseas. Nice to see a bulk supply available here at a decent price. TL;DR Delicious!"
"These sugars are so good! They make great, light, fluffy, cotton candy! They work extremely well compared to using hard candy. They all taste great! I would highly recommend these for anyone making homemade cotton candy! They taste as great as boardwalk cotton candy! :) TL;DR Fantastic"
"Great tasting gum. Restores pH level to normal, reducing acidity in the mouth. Nice travel size. Can share with others without contamination. TL;DR Xylitol gum"
"These were just ok.  They weren't horrible, but not great either.<br />If I""m really hungry and need something fast, I'll eat these.<br />They do fill me up at least. TL;DR Not great tasting, not horrible"
"First of all, I want to start off by saying that I'm not crazy!!!  I am a homebrewer and in my free time I enjoy day dreaming up the next great beer.  One day after eating girl scout thin mint cookies, an idea hit me.  I could add this Mint Teisseire to my Chocolate Stout beer and have a perfect Mint Chocolate Stout!!!!  I've got to say, it turned out perfectly!!!  This mint syrup did not disappoint, even in an odd use such as mine!  To me, that's the mark of quality!  Yummmmm! TL;DR Good in Beer Too!!!"
"I bought these for my husband and he loved them. I tought they were a little too sweet. If you like really sweet stuff this is for you, They are a cross between fudge and brownie. TL;DR wonderful"
"I LOVE this product and the taste is great. I drink more water thanks to this product while getting my caffeine boost. On my last auto-order, it said that this product has been discontinued. Please say that isn't true!!!! TL;DR Awesome product but was told its discontinued?? Say it isnt so!!!!!"
"My dogs eats Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Grain Free Limited Ingredient Diet Chicken and Sweet Potato Recipe (15 pound bag) and  and likes it.  I ordered more on June 4th.  Amazon told me that it is not available for delivery.  Yet on the website, it is listed as available though stock seems low..  Where is my delivery? TL;DR Amazon won't deliver this item....."
This coffee has a great taste and just knowing that its decaf should make it devoid of flavor.  NOT!  It has a wonderful aroma when you open the bag and the taste delivers.  It has a great flavor and its organic. It doesn't get any better than that! TL;DR Great Beans!
This is a nice storage rack.  Didn't care for the round twirly ones I've seen.  Saves space with the Keurig unit on top of it. TL;DR Works Well
"If you're like me, you like your chocolate with that salty bite; chocolate covered pretzels, french fries in frosties, and potato chips in chocolate ice cream are just a few of my favorite creations. These are now on the list! Not too salty and very smooth - a great snack for sure! TL;DR delicous!"
"This is a product without a clear purpose.  Do you use it as a taco sauce?  Salad dressing?  Marinade?  Condiment?<br /><br />I used it on tacos and the results were---ehhh.<br /><br />The chipotle imparts a smoky, earthy flavor which doesn't pair to badly with ground beef, but it also has some chemically-tasting unpleasant undertones.  Regular taco sauce and sour cream both proved superior.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this unless you're a real chipotle fan or just bored out of your gourd with traditional Mexican condiments. TL;DR Ehhh"
I've been a fan of Sticky Fingers Scone Mix for years. They turn out moist and taste great. You can't go wrong with this mix. TL;DR Delicious
"I am constantly on the go and fast food is not a good option even though it is ""fast"".  This item says its for children, but ""big kids"" like me love taking a few of these on the go so when I get real hungry, I can curve my appetite by putting a quick healthy snack into my system unitl I can get a healthy meal in. TL;DR Peter Rabbit Organics Apple and Grape"
I love these Chiclets! I do not go for sugar free gum and that seems to be the only choices these days.<br />So I like to stock up on these babies! They have enough fruity flavor and it last a good while.<br />The gum does not get hard after a while of chewing either. TL;DR Have to hide this in my private gum stash!! Yumm!
"Why post a picture of items you are not selling?  I get very frustrated with sellers who use a stock photo of general items instead of the actual items they are selling.  It isn't difficult to take a picture of the actual item - or search for a stock photo of the actual item you are selling.<br /><br />What is even *more* frustrating is that they don't bother to list the flavors you are buying since the photo is not accurate.<br /><br />The picture shows six different flavors of Activate.  I actually thought I was receiving all six since Activate has many more than six flavors.  I thought THAT is what ""variety"" meant.  I received three bottles each of four different flavors.  Are they relying on their legal disclaimer to diffuse their laziness?  ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented...""  Even so, that does not say the PRODUCT is different than the picture.<br /><br />I bought this product because I saw the Exotic Berry flavor at Wal-mart.  Tried it, and thought it was pretty good.  But I don't live near a Wal-mart and have not seen it elsewhere.<br /><br />I rate Amazon's employee who posted this item with one star since I don't see another way to rate the seller right now.  If I easily find a way of rating the seller, I will change my star-rating here.<br /><br />The Exotic Berry flavor is fine.  It is the only flavor I have had.  The other flavors shipped in the box are Lemon-Lime, Orange, and Fruit Punch.  Had I known that Blueberry and Pear were not included, I would have purchased a different package from Amazon - one where the employee bothered to find the right stock photo of the item being sold. TL;DR Picture Does Not Show Product"
"Interesting concept! Very tasty too, I used the chocolate PB2 in my vanilla ice cream and it was a lean alternative to flavored syrups. I purchased these products to cut down on the fat from regular peanut butter. I would order it again although it is a bit pricey. TL;DR tasty"
"You have to try these fruit bars. They are unlike any other fruit bar. They are mostly fruit. In fact it is the first ingredient!!! They are a great energy source and full of heart healthy nuts and seeds, and they are gluten free, dairy free AND cruelty free!!! I highly recommend these to anyonewho want an all natural boost of energy! They are moist and taste GREAT! TL;DR Best Fruit Bar Ever!!"
I actually haven't received my package yet from Amazon but found a bottle in the organic market yesterday and used it on my chicken breast. I thought it was pretty good and I need a salt replacement. I'm trying to lose weight don't need salt adding on to my weight. I recommend it ! TL;DR Kelp taste good to me !!!
"I bring these to work all the time.  They taste good and are a healthy snack.  Buyer beware:  it is not uncommon to crunch down on something that feels like a shell, or sometimes even a rock or dirt.  And occasionally there is a very, very slight fishy aftertaste that I'm not sure about.  Perhaps they need to be stored in the fridge. TL;DR good energy bars"
"This isn't an everyday dessert.  It's very good, rivaling what you get at a restaurant.  The only trouble I have is getting it to come cleanly out of the ramekin pans.  I think the trick is (contrary to the directions), is to wait a couple of minutes prior to taking it out.  You could also buy a 2 piece pan. TL;DR Delicious but expensive"
"I usually drink my teas plain.  By this, I mean I don't add sugar or milk.  That way, I can appreciate the flavor the tea has to offer more fully.  This one is no exception.  The flavor is terrific!  I am becoming more and more pleased with the quality of Stash teas.  I'm happy to see this offered at Amazon, my grocery store only carried it for the winter holiday season. TL;DR Great after-dinner tea"
"Agave is the best thing next to a slice of homemade bread. I use it in place of reg. white sugar. My mother is a type 2 diabetic and with agave she can have a full piece of her favorite Thanksgiving desert pumkin pie with no raise in her blood sugar. There is light and dark versions just like in maple syrup. I prefer the dark especially in baking and cooking I think it has more flavor. Try it in your oatmeal with cinnamon. You eat oatmeal because it is good for you so why not make it even better, trade brown sugar or yucky artificial sugar for a more healthy natural alternative. Check out madhavahoney.com for a complete history on agave. TL;DR Agave"
"My dog has diabetes and this is about the only treat out there we can give her.  She loves them.  She is an American Eskimo, and they love to chew.  This gives her lots of things to chew on.  The bag has a resealable closure, but we put ours in a little plastic container anyway.  These are a little expensive but better on Amazon than anywhere.  Also, Amazon delivers stuff when it says, and my dog doesn't like waiting.  Or more to the point, I don't like my dog having to wait. TL;DR Great for Diabetic Dogs"
"Great seasoning for rice and Japanese dishes. It is NOT vegetarian however, although the company makes another variation (one of many) that IS vegetarian... Very hard to find, so it's great that you can get it on Amazon now. TL;DR Good, but NOT for vegetarians..."
"After the high reviews on this product, I figured I should try it out... Maybe I had raised my hopes a little too high, because although this is does have a pretty good taste to it, I don't think it deserves quite 5 stars. You can really taste the apple flavor it in (a little sour), so if you like that flavor in your cereal, then you might like this product! I mixed this first with water, until the chia seeds became a goo-like substance - didn't like the taste of that that much. Then I just ate it on its own - that tastes great, actually! Eating it plain by the spoonful is a great snack. I haven't tried it with hemp milk or almond milk quite yet, but that might also be a great combination. TL;DR alright"
"This coffee delivers a strong flavor without being a dark roasat. By comparison, it makes many other coffees just seem bland. This is a coffee that will appeal to everyone. TL;DR This Coffee Has An Amazing Taste"
"Your guess is as good as mine regarding what Festival means when they claim that their canned shiitake slices are ""Fresh Pack.""  On a separate subject:  Unlike MW Polar brand of canned sliced shiitake, Festival brand does not add sesame oil, which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding unwanted calories from the ""bad"" polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (omega-6), which is the only kind of polyunsaturated fat contained in sesame oil. TL;DR Festival doesn't tell us what they mean by ""Fresh Pack"""
"I bought this bulk packaging because it is a favorite blend that is used daily in the office. However, the description of ""Pack of six 40-count boxes"" was less descriptive than was useful. Upon opening one of the six boxes the internal foil packet had 4 tea bags in each and each tea bag was smaller than a ""normal"" tea bag. I had to use two to get the same strength as I usually do. The ""savings"" were not worth the hassle of dealing with open packets that needed to be stored, and doubling up on tea bags. I was disappointed because I love Bigelow teas. I will continue to buy Bigelow, but not in bulk. TL;DR Disliked packaging."
"This is the first and only ""dog"" food my Yorkie eats. He also likes green beans and carrots which we give him in small quantities as treats. Royal Canin specializes this food specifically for this small, active breed. This is the best price and shipping is free from Amazon. TL;DR Yorkie Lover"
"didn't like it and won't buy again, I had to use the whole bottle and still it didn't give the flavor like cake batter enough as compared to lets say Coldstone cake batter icecream.  So for me it wasn't very good. TL;DR cake batter flavor"
"This DecoBros® storage drawer advertizes it holds 36 K-cups, but it actually holds 42 Keurig K-cups, if you put one up and one top down into the rows.  It would be nice to place it on my counter with the Keurig coffee maker on top, but alas I know my cabinets sit too low.  I use the carousal to hold my K-cups on the countertop.<br />I needed something to store my extra coffee/tea k-cups on the shelf in my pantry.  The two storage drawers ($14.99 each from Pretty Star Store and fulfilled by Amazon) fit perfectly stacked on my pantry shelf and I even have room on top to store several different size boxes of plastic zip bags, foil, waxed paper and plastic wrap.  The drawer slides out easily and tilts slightly so I can see the back of the rows.  I would recommend these drawers for on the counter or in the pantry.  They are sturdy, well built and have a nice rubberized top (which keeps the items stacked on them from slipping off). TL;DR DecoBros® 36 K-Cup Storage Drawer (ACTUALLY HOLDS 42 K-CUPS)"
"Misrepresented item on description. Indicated a 30# item that appeared substantial in the picture. Received an 8 1/2"" tall, plastic dispenser that weighed 8 1/2 ounces! For $30 no less! NO WAY! RETURN! TL;DR crappy plastic dispenser"
"Sure, we'd all prefer the ingredients list be organized differently, but this is a solid truffle that can be gotten for $5.39/box @ Costco during certain times of the year (Easter & Winter holidays, it seems). TL;DR Bargain for good chocolate"
We cannot get enough of this cereal in our house.  Even the toddler loves it for snacks.  Great price on subscribe & save. TL;DR GREAT PRODUCT!
"I have no problem with the product just the different shipping prices. i did think i was going to get free shipping, but that didn't happen. like i said the product is fine. TL;DR oolong shot"
"I love sesame seeds and I'm always looking for a satisfying afternoon snack. I tried the Sezme Sesame Snaps and they're fine, but they taste sugary. I prefer the nice honey flavor of these. I keep them at work and in the car for any time I get hungry or need to boost my energy before a workout. I've had the same experience as some others where sometimes they stick together, but other than that they've  been perfect for me. TL;DR A great healthy and slightly sweet snack"
"Good taste, but is not as good as the Rio Platense Dulce de leche. It would be great if we could find in Amazon Dulce de leche from Uruguay: Conaprole, Los Nietitos... TL;DR This product is Manjar not Dulce the leche"
"I bought this thinking it would be good & even though I followed the instructions, it was horrible. The brownie mix seemed really dry that I added extra water in hopes off saving it & that didn't work. The cookie mix was looked like clumpy bread crumbs instead of cookie dough. By the this I thought of throwing everything away but my bf was insistent. I greased the pan for the brownie bars & there wasn't enough brownie mix to cover the entire pan & that's considering we used a really small pan! The cookie mix was difficult to place because it was dry and crumb like. After I took it out of the oven it was really hard to take off the pan. I had to really use force with a spatula to take it off. The edible parts tasted ok, the cookie mix didn't really taste like cookies and the brownie mix didn't really taste like brownies, both kinda plain. In the end it wasn't worth the hassel and it was just a complete fail. TL;DR A disaster"
"My Maine Coon cat ""Taz"" developed a colitis like condition which caused him terrible discomfort, loose bloody stools, and vomitting. Our vet recommended the Royal Canin 33 Formula and he has improved dramatically. Thank you Royal Canin for  superior products from a company that can be trusted. TL;DR Maine Coon Cat"
"My mom loved these, and would share them with me when I was a kid. These are one of my absolute favorite candy bars. They are a lot harder for me to find now locally, and Big Cherry just doesn't compare.<br />The chocolate tastes like it's infused with the cherry flavor, it's a milk chocolate that's a bit above grocery store quality. Not gourmet, but not waxy and not too sweet, the nuts are just the right amount. It's a cherry bar with nuts, not a nut bar with cherries. The nuts add a nice crunch and flavor, the creamy fondant center is cherry flavored without being too overwhelming.<br />So much of what I thought tasted great 30 years ago doesn't taste good at all as an adult. I'm glad to say, these are still a favorite. TL;DR Childhood favorite"
I tried this seasoned flour because I like the idea of not having to season flour myself. I used it on fried pork chops. The pork chops were a family hit! Can't wait to try it on fried chicken and fried dill pickles!!! Yummy!!! Not too salty either. Will have to buy from Amazon because not available in my area. TL;DR Love This Product! Yummy!!!
Arrived in good condition.  Nice item for winter mornings.  Convenience is the main reason for purchase.  These types of items are cheaper in bulk. TL;DR Pleased
We experienced spotty coats and sick dogs from some of the higher ranked and priced foods on the market.  This is the best dog food I have found.  Both dogs have not been sick since we bought this food and their coats have become full and shiney.  They love the food.  We don't even have to add anything to it.  Extremely happy with this product. TL;DR Best I have found.  Loyal user
"This was always one of my favorite Chunky soups.  However it seems that when Campbell started advertising their new 'leaner cuts' they interpreted those words to mean quantity rather than quality. Last can of Sirloin Burger contained 4 pieces of meat (2 per serving).  Same with their Select soup.  My White Bean Chicken Chili also contained 4 pieces of chicken for the 2 servings. Guess it was a way to cut down on production costs but not price. I like to get what, I hope at least, I'm paying for.  I complained to Campbell but never heard back on my e-mail. Since then I have switched to Progresso and other brands. TL;DR A Former Campbell Soup Customer"
"I had much difficulty finding a cat food that my fussy cats would eat.  They love this Royal Canin.  It was an easy change from the Science Diet cat food.  After reading about the ingredients in Science Diet and how it was not good for the animals, I decided to try this Royal Canin.  It's good for the animals and nutritious and not only that but they love it!  This is what we will buy from now on. TL;DR Good food!  My cats love it!"
"I put seven drops in my 27oz. water bottle. I can get in all my water through the day now. I also make paleo comfort food's ""morning glory muffins"" and put two dropper-fuls in the batter. Incredible.<br /><br />I  make lemon truffles with coconut butter (not oil), lemon juice, rind and this lemon stevia. Blend all together and chill in the fridge. Wow!!!<br /><br /> I  use the vanilla in my baking, coffee and tea.<br /><br />use it! enjoy it! TL;DR LOVE!"
"Lipton's Blackberry Vanilla herbal tea comes in a cute little bag shaped like a pyramid.  The flavors of blackberry and raspberry are a pleasant change from the norm, with the smallest trace of vanilla.<br /><br />I will use this product again.  It's a very nice way to fill my teacup. TL;DR Pleasant berry taste with just a trace of vanilla"
"To test this product, i sprinkled a layer onto an area of my yard that one of my cats has taken to using as his private litter box. It's bare dirt, dry, sheltered from the wind.<br /><br />I used about half of the package, which claims to cover 300 square feet, on this area that's approximately 75 square feet. I didn't intend to overdose it so badly, but it's very hard to estimate how much you're shaking out over what square footage. (In case you don't feel like doing the math, that means i used about twice as much per square foot as the packaging says is necessary.)<br /><br />Day 1: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, sniffed around, and meandered off. I didn't see him set foot in that space all day.<br /><br />Day 2: The cat went to his new favorite toilet, dug a hole, and did his business.<br /><br />So even at double strength, this product deterred a housecat for all of approximately one day. One windless, rainless day. That hardly seems like something worth spending money on.<br /><br />And speaking of money, you're paying for something that is, by weight, less than 1% active ingredients. That means about 0.8 ounces of this product is important, and the rest is filler. And those active ingredients are basically black pepper and a little bit of something like cayenne pepper. You can buy a 2-3 ounce container of black pepper at any grocery store for a few dollars, so why pay more than $20 for this? Even if it worked, it would be a waste of money. TL;DR Worked for about 24 hours"
"My son was a micropreemie who was diagnosed Failure to Thrive for getting insufficient calories, due to a feeding delay, uncontrolled reflux, and extended illness.  He began drinking Pediasure as his complete nutrition at 11 months adjusted.  While he did still eat table foods, he was incapable of eating enough food to make a caloric difference during the day.<br /><br />Well, after two months on Pediasure (with Fiber, to make his stools looser), he was finally ON the weight growth chart, after NEVER having been on the chart before!  And after another 2 months, he is making steady strides towards a good growth curve.<br /><br />Although the containers say it tastes better very cold, my son prefers Pediasure at room temperature.  He does not like cold drinks at all.  My only complaint is that these containers tend to dent easily, because they are coming through the mail.  It's always worrisome when you find a dented container of food; however, in no cases have I found that the contents are disturbed/befouled by the denting.  Good stuff! TL;DR Good stuff, saved the day!"
"My dog loves everything we've tried from Merrick.  No GI upsets from anything we've tried so far, including several varieties of the canned food. TL;DR Great for a finicky eater"
"I purchased this dressing on a whim and am just delighted with the wonderful vibrant flavor.  I have taken to chunking up cucumber and tomato, marinading it overnight in this dressing and enjoying.  It makes a perfect low cal, high satisfaction treat for when you just want something to munch on.  My next endeavor will be using it as a chicken marinade and I can't wait to taste the results. This will now be a staple item in my kitchen. TL;DR Oh My YUMMMM"
"These chips are pretty delicious.. Even the original flavor with nothing on it is good. It's not as delicious as Doritos, but it's also not fried either, which definitely balances it out. A good snack for all times of day! TL;DR Pretty delicious"
"The Peppermint Mocha Latte is mediocre when it comes to coffee flavor.  It takes more like a cocoa mix because it lacks a certain edge I expect from coffee, even if it is a latte.  I put 4 heaping teaspoons in an 8 oz. mug and it's still bland.  It's not a diet product so I expected a richness but it's pretty flat.  The fat, calorie, and sugar content is not bad, at least. For 1 1/3 tbs. you get 70 calories, 2% fat, and 7 g. sugar.  It's a nice thing to have on hand for the holidays but if you are looking for flavor, you are probably better off brewing your own coffee and dropping a Starlight mint in your cup and a squeeze from the good old Hershey syrup bottle. TL;DR No ho-ho-hos for me"
I love Grove Square Spiced Apple Cider Cups (single serve cup for Keurig K-Cup brewers).  I am not a coffee drinker like my husband and wanted to try something more than just hot chocolate with his Keurig.  I thought I would try the Spiced Apple and love it.  The bonus to this product is that it is SUGAR FREE.  I highly recommend this-- winter or summer. TL;DR I'm addicted to this!
"Cookies BBQ sauce is made in Wall Lake, Iowa. The original BBQ sauce is smoky sweet. For my family, we like smoky sweet, and too many of the sauces nowadays have too much of a bite.<br /><br />The BBQ sauce can almost be used as a substitute for ketchup, but I'd rather save it for ribs and chicken!<br /><br />From their web site:<br /><br />Cookies Food Products, manufacturer of ""the award-winning sauces America loves to eat,"" had its start in a small town in Northwest Iowa. L.D. Cook of Wall Lake, Iowa, produced the first batch of Cookies Bar ""B""""Q"" Sauce in his kitchen in 1976. A year later, Speed Herrig, another local Wall Lake resident, took over the sales duties and hit the road selling his outdoor cooking product out of the back of his pickup. His hard work and persistence paid off. In 1984, Herrig bought the company from Cook. At that time the sauce was being bottled in a small building on the edge of town. Today, Cookies products are still produced in Wall Lake, but Herrig and the Cookies crew are housed in a modern 105,000 square foot manufacturing facility. TL;DR Best Sweet BBQ Sauce Ever!"
"I've been drinking kicking horse from amazon for well over a year and my last 3 months worth of orders have all been disappointing to say the least, this simply is not the same bean they were selling last year, the quality has dropped measurably and their price keeps steadily rising, it's simply not worth the price anymore for a bean of this low quality. I would suggest trying out some ravens brew, the quality of their bean and roast has become far superior to any of the kicking horse brews, this coffee simply not the same as it used to be, it's been changed for maximum profitability rather than a quality product. TL;DR Rising in price, significant drop in quality"
"The bag said it had assorted flavors, but there was only about 10 of the apple flavor, which is kid of dissapionting TL;DR not enough apple"
Yummy.  Are these really any better for you then regular candy?  Who knows.  At least you can pretend.  Nice size bags and great flavor. Same taste I've loved for years. TL;DR good
"No one is lying here... it does take 30 minutes to cook!! But it is sure worth it!! This is the ultimate breakfast!! Not sure if I was going to like it or not. $20.00 for 4 cans of oatmeal, what am I nuts here? When I got it, it was WONDERFUL. I am ordering another 4 cans!! TL;DR It just doesn't get any better than this!!"
"I am not a fan of green teas, but I really love this one.  It has a nice ""non-tea"" taste.  It's hard to find in stores so I got the 6 pack.  Great price and shipped really fast. TL;DR Love this tea"
"This is the brand I usually purchase at the local co-op, and I am super stoked to see it here for half of what I normally pay so I just purchased two pounds. I can go through a pound in a month because I use it to make deodorant, toothpaste, to oil pull with, as a supplement, to cook with, and as body and hair moisturizer for me and my toddler. We both have very curly hair and dry skin and this is my favorite oil to use. It does have a somewhat strong scent that smells similar to buttered popcorn, haha, but I like it. No one has ever remarked that we smell bad. A few times I've been told we smell like pastry or coconut or ""something vaguely familiar"" and whenever I mention popcorn usually people agree. Anyways, I love this for first aid (rashes, cuts, burns) and to fend of sickness (often I can take a TBS and oil pull and feel better within an hour). Word of caution: take it easy if you are taking this internally at first. I've thrown up from taking too much on an empty stomach before (felt better immediately after, though). The die-off from bacteria can cause you to have ""detox sickness"". Oh! And it helps make breastmilk richer too. I really hope it will stay at this price long enough for me to make my next order. Love, love, love! TL;DR Love this stuff!"
"I wish Amazon would provide nutritional information on its product page. I took a chance on this and they are very high in calories for the quantity. Each plank has 2 servings, 190 calories each. In other words, each plank is about 400 calories - too much for me. I won't be buying these again. TL;DR High in calories"
"The coffee is not strong and you can taste the added flavors.  I first tried this as my first cup of coffee and decided it was definitely not the coffee I would start my day on. I prefer a stronger, bolder flavor for first thing. Love the taste of espresso double shots. I do like a flavored coffee, tend to go for one in the afternoon.  So I found this to be on the sweet side but then I never add any sugar or sweetener to my drinks. (nor syrup to my pancakes, gotta have butter) You get the idea I prefer savory to sweet.  If you like nut flavored coffee and chocolate you would probably like this. I like it. TL;DR A pleasant change"
This yogurt starter worked very well.  The directions on the packet were very easy to follow.  The packets were a little difficult to open but other than that the product is great. TL;DR Wonderful
"I have two very picky cats -- they like moist cat food, but not from cans!  The Gravy Sensations are their favorites.  Interestingly, one prefers the seafood pouches and the other chooses the chicken pouches.  It makes my life easier to have both types in one container -- no search in stores which often have only one or the other. TL;DR Picky eaters choose Friskies"
"This is a fantastic, healthy oil that can handle high heat like a pro. I love that it's organic, extra-virgin, and cold-pressed. I do wish it came in a glass jar, but I understand at this size it wouldn't be cost-effective. Be careful when digging around once the jar gets more than half-empty: the edge of the plastic container is actually pretty sharp, and I managed to nick myself twice now (on the inner arm, ouchies).<br /><br />It does have a pronounced coconut oil, as one would expect, but this becomes much more subtle mixed with stronger flavors (cocoa, meat, strong spices).<br /><br />And you can't beat the price per ounce! TL;DR Great!"
I enjoy this beverage I can drink it anytime and don't have to worry about the caffeine or getting non-caffeine coffee.  I wish it came in individual packs of single servings so I could easily carry it with me.  I make it stronger because I love strong coffee that I cannot tell the difference between the two.<br />I've been drinking it for 3 years.  I do drink regular coffee when I'm out because I don't carry the jar with me.<br /><br />I originally looked for a breakfast beverage because I had pains in my heart area too much caffeine will do that to you and I drank lots of Starbucks coffee almost daily all day.<br /><br />I highly recommend Roma beverage.  You get the best price with Amazon TL;DR Great Stuff
"This is my fourth order of Newman's Own Organic Raisins and they're consistently the best ever. After trying Organic Raisins at a few health food stores, including Trader Joes, these are not only better but for the same price as T.J. they're delivered right to my door! I LOVE IT. ;-D TL;DR BRILLIANT PRODUCT!!"
"I like all the products I have bought from this company. They have good flavor, nice constancy, not too sweet, flavorful and are filling. Company offers a nice  variety. TL;DR Good and good for you"
"i am a college student and buy chow mein teriyaki flavor, cheap and convenient at your local supermarket,.i urge you to try it,you'll be amazed, yum yum, i can sing praises till tomorrow TL;DR delicious and addictive"
Meet all my expectations. Enjoyed every can. Plan on ordering some more in the near future. Order was received in the time frame indicated TL;DR San pellegrino
"My dogs love these, although I don't think they have ever met a treat that they didn't like. My one dog has allergies and I was glad the ingredients in these treats can all be pronounced. I would purchase these again. TL;DR Fruitables Dog Treats"
"I love this item, the pork cooks very tender and the shake n bake adds a great flavor, rather than eating plain pork.  A butcher recommends this to his customers.  A nice break from steak, chicken and fish. TL;DR Very tasty"
"I like my coffee  dark and bold. So far Tim's Midnight Magic and People Coffee, Tiger, are my favorites. TL;DR Good and Bold"
"I bought this recently when Amazon had it on sale, ended up being around $6.00 a pound.  Not a bad price for an organic whole bean coffee.  Description says it finishes with a sweet marshmallow taste, I didn't find that to be true.  I would rate it as average, good coffee flavor, but not worth the regular price. TL;DR Only buy when on sale"
"These boba pearls are great! They taste amazing and are great to put in tea's, smoothies, coffee's, or just about anything else. I bought them because I moved away from some of my favorite Thai restaurants (who sold Thai tea with boba) and I can brew my own thai tea, pop these in it and it is delicious. The only slight problem is that they take a bit longer to cook than is advertised on the packaging (which says 5-7 minutes). Just leave them boiling a few minutes longer and you'll get the right consistency. All-in-all a great purchase! TL;DR Great!"
"I am very disappointed in this product. I expected aromatic, full flavored turmeric. Instead it has a flat, non-distinct, unimpressive, flavorlessness. The dishes I have used this particular turmeric in have had a dull, lifeless quality. TL;DR disappointing"
It is great. I never odered food or snacks on amazon.. but by buyin these I will start.. it shipped n got his so very quick faster then anything else I orders.. n I love it so much it keeps my cal in take low while not having to give up stuff I like.. n price wise it was great.. I will have to b back for more TL;DR love it.
"I have an Alaskan Malamute (120lbs) who I do not consider an aggressive chewer, but he is powerful. Even the largest size Everlasting Ball fits entirely in his jaws and he figured out pretty quickly that if he crunches down the treats just fall out. I tried it with the treats you have to screw in to see if it made it more difficult and had the same results. He finishes off the disks and ignores the toy in less than 5 minutes. Total waste for him.<br /><br />However, this toy has been a godsend for my Alaskan Klee Kai (8lbs). When she had a broken leg and was on bed rest for months this toy really helped out and would occupy her for days. Well worth it in her case.<br /><br />I think the key is getting a size appropriate for your dog. If your dog can fit the entire thing in its mouth, it's too small. When in doubt get the next size up, and if you have an XL mouthed breed don't bother. TL;DR Not good for Giant breeds!"
"This mix is really versatile - I have made banana bread, berry bread and plain bread with it!  It's a fantastic treat for someone with wheat, egg, and dairy allergies like me!  I plan to make some cinnamon bread one of these days! TL;DR Fantastic and Easy"
"A local health food store rep recommended organic raspberry leaf tea to get my system back on track ( tired, moody, stress, indomnia,overweight) though skeptic, I started drinking the tea three times a day as directed. By day two I noticed my milk supply began to increase it doubld. By the end of week 1 friends and family notice a positive mood change and my milk supply had tripled I went from 4oz to 8oz every 3 hrs. Im at the end of week two and I am now at 12oz per pumping session! I tripled within two weeks of me taking the raspberry leaf tea! I have enough milk to freeze now. As far as the issues I had mentioned above all are decreasing but not completely gone away. My life is more in order due to me being less irritable and being able to sleep, I haven't loss weight but I am not gaining weight either with exercise. It's only been two weeks and I feel as though my body is getting back on track! I love this tea and it is a must have, keep and share! TL;DR Got Milk!!!"
"The word ""buttery"" on the label is as close as this gets to flavoring popcorn. It is orange and gelatinous when cold. It heats up well and pops the corn nicely, but adds no discernable flavor. TL;DR Makes popcorn...butter yellow?"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY3A8C"">Knorr All Purpose Aromat Seasoning 3oz./85g</a><br />This seasoning can be found in just about every home in Switzerland and probably most other European homes but for some reason Americans don't know about it. It is one of the most versatile seasonings ever and I cant imagine cooking without it. Its a MUST for veggies, pasta, eggs, soups, salads and sauces. I wish some importer would see the opportunity it this product and market it to the whole country. TL;DR Every kitchen needs Aromat"
Best bisquick pancakes I've ever made!  I think these are better than the original Bisquick pancakes.  My husband even loved these!  I would recommend buying this product! TL;DR Amazing!
"Excellent product, fast delivery, excellent price (because of subscription: $23.66 for 6 bags of 18 pods). However, the current (June 2010) price ($3.94 per bag of 18 pods) needs to be reassessed because of dropping Euro (1Euro=$1.30). Local groceries sell bags for $5.75, with coupon $5.25. However, Target dropped its price to $4.24, only 30 cents from Amazon's price! Price review by Amazon is urgently needed. TL;DR Price review urgently needed"
I have purchased this tea in sachets in the past and really enjoyed the flavor. This bulk package was a great value. I have been enjoying it both hot and iced. TL;DR Delicious tea
"We've enjoyed all of the SweetLeaf liquid stevia's we've tried, but we really love the Vanilla Creme! It seems to go well with coffee or hot chocolate, and adds a gentle touch of Vanilla to other beverages like Chai tea, or on home made ice cream or with a bowl of fruit. TL;DR Stevia Vanilla Creme'"
"We have a very strict diet (no:gluten/wheat, dairy/casein, egg, soy, chocolate among many others). This is by far the best ""Allergy free"" chewy granola bar out there, especially for the cost (you can get them at target for less than 3 dollars! They don't have a ton of flavor, but most of the things we eat don't so we're ok with that. I'd try a box of them before buying bulk, but as allergy sufferers this is quite a treat for us! :)<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />So, we have ordered these in bulk several times from amazon. Everything has always been great till this last shipment. at nearly 4.00 a box, I expect amazing quality, but unfortunately the first box we opened they were all hard as rocks. we contacted annies to get some help. They were worthless, and the woman we spoke to was like a robot. Worst customer service I have had in a LONG time. Needless to say, they weren't willing to do practically anything, and we are no longer purchasing their products. VERY disappointed, and will definitely be telling others about the experience. Though we loved these, but at 4.00 a box for 7 bars, and poor customer service on top of it, we're done! TL;DR A treat for the allergy stricken! Hit or miss quality & poor customer service"
"I made my first deep fried turkey last night.  I generally use a pepper rub when I make turkey, but the oil would have washed it off, so I used Tony Chachere's Style Butter Marinade and was dazzled by the results!  Everyone agreed it was the best turkey they had ever had.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.<br /><br />Please note--this is a butter marinade, not a spicy Cajun marinade.  It's wonderful, but if you are looking for the heat, you may want to look at other alternatives.  This was smooth and, as the name suggests, very buttery. TL;DR Easy to use and makes for great flavor"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UO90BA"">Yerba Mate Cruz de Malta x 500 g Argentina Diet Loss Herbal Bags Slim 1.1 lb New</a><br /><br />Excellent Yerba Mate, Cruz de Malta, fast delivery, Thank You Rovy Coffee... TL;DR !!Fast Delivery, excellent mate!!!!, thank you!!!!"
"I love this rub. It has a rich earthy taste that is wonderful on ribs. Rub it on the ribs, then place them on slabs of onion, put about a cup of beer in the pan, cover with foil and roast slowly for several hours. Awesome! I acn't find this in the stores anymore. Thank goodness for Amazon! I've also used it on beef, chicken, and pork. It's a pantry staple. TL;DR Awesome!"
Three flavors were advertised with this sampler and it only had two and of course the missing flavor was the one the gift recipient wanted....bah humbug! TL;DR Missing a flavor!
"I bought this product last summer when I was experimenting with buying in bulk while I was living at college over the summer and working for Admissions. I brought in the sushi kit one day and had so much fun surprising all of the counselors with sushi. The sticky rice adheres to the seaweed after it is cooked. The kit is ""beginner-friendly"" to rolling sushi. At first, I didn't really know what I was doing. The product tastes great even if you don't add meat or vegetables. It's surprisingly filling. TL;DR Adds some fun to lunch at work"
"I purchased this oil from Amazon for cooking and for use as an after-shower, after-bath body oil.  Delivery was quick through Amazon, and I was very pleased with the purchase.  The oil has a pleasant but light coconut fragrance and is very light-weight.  I haven't used it for cooking yet, however, I have used it after shower, and it is a great moisturizer that is absorbed into the skin well, leaving minimal-to-no oily residue on the skin.  I like the fact that it smells NATURALLY good (i.e. having no perfumes nor other unhealthy additives that would be absorbed through the skin).<br /><br />Since I will be cooking with this and eating it, I love the fact that it's organic and has been shown to improve the symptoms of and decline associated with Alzheimer's Disease.  This oil is supposed to have a shelf life of two years.  Wow.  We eat far too many processed and adulterated foods; hardly do we need any bulking agents, sweeteners, preservatives or artificial colors and flavors. TL;DR Excellent oil"
You only have to taste it once to realize just how bad all the other ginger ales are.<br /><br />There simply is nothing close to it.<br /><br />It is even better than any other soft drink period! TL;DR The one and ONLY ginger ale
"If there is such a thing as gourmet licorice, this is it.  These taste like red licorice infused with fruit juice.  I can't say that I necessarily recognized the fruit flavor as distinctly pomegranate- it could just as easily be a berry flavor or other similar fruit.  Still, it makes for a tasty combination.  The result is not too sweet, and a bit firmer and chewier than what I was expecting. TL;DR Licorice, Grown Up"
"I have been drinking Blue Mountain Coffee off and on for the last 5 years, switching it with Kona (I am a true coffee snob...). After the local coffee shop here decided not to carry Blue Mtn anymore- I decided to give this a try- I was not disappointed at all. This coffee is true Blue mountain, tastes as good if not better than the fresh roasted coffee from my local roaster, and gives that extra jolt of caffeine I have come to love from this premium bean. TL;DR Blue Mountain is the best"
"I love Fiji water. I can never quite put my finger on what is different about it, but it is a significant and positive difference.  It feels different too. There are other nutrients in it, which are listed on the bottle, and this makes me feel like it is an enhanced experience of drinking water to stay healthy and hydrated. I definitely recommend it. (I also like the low prices and free shipping that are sometimes available on Amazon). TL;DR Love it."
This bread is delicious fresh out of the oven.  I use my Kitchenaid mixer to blend the dough together and shape this into bread sticks.  I've tried the recipe with and without the added cheese. Hands down they taste better and have a better texture without the cheese. Most of my friends can't tell that they're eating gluten free bread. TL;DR so good
"This Zico coconut water, in three flavors, is absolutely sensational! Until it is available in my area, I definitely will order more of this healthy product. The best drink discovery of my life! Excellent taste, fast delivery, good for me.....what's not to like? TL;DR Wonderful and healthy product!"
"POISON ""Chlorhexidine"" POISON<br />We have two beautiful Saint Bernards. After using these for some time, it began to be a routine that they would BOTH have to go outside to vomit after their supposed morning treat and dental care. We investigated this chemical that the package warns you about, ""Chlorhexidine"" and stopped using the ignorantly designed dog hating treat. No more sick dogs.<br />If anyone likes their Dog at all, they will READ the package. Notice first the ingredient,  ""Chlorhexidine"" then the warnings.<br />There's good vets who don't sell these, and BAD vets who like the profits.<br />Of course, Pharma and all their ""vet/doctor"" salesmen will say this product has been tested, used for years, found to be safe in thus and thus quantities, and on and on.<br />Well, the chemical Chlorhexidine is used to KILL bacteria. GOOD AND BAD!<br />It's used pre-surgically, washing the body and prescription only mouthwashes.<br />Your dog, like all living beings has a body especially a digestive tract, FULL of very much needed bacterium.<br />The company knows this, and to protect themselves even warns that ""serious"" problems may occur, especially if your dog ""licks"" the surface first? Wow, and how is a dog supposed to NOT lick a dog chew he's sucking on for hours and yet consume it?<br />Do some research on what this stuff WILL do to your dog people. Unless your trying to euthanize your dog with a long, painful, and; ""conveniently- racking up a massive vet bill to diagnose"" and non treatable death sentence, STOP FEEDING THEM THIS POISON.  And YES, they are the same ""intellectual scientists"" who've managed to put half our nation on ""safe for you"" psychotropic drugs.<br />Ironically, ""prolonged use of this poison will cause tooth discoloration,"" leading to possible other side effects of tooth decay.""<br />Japan stopped using ""Chlorhexidine"" on catheters and other medical devices in 97' after many became sick and one died.<br />Causes numerous (still discovering more) problems with cats. Deafness, respiratory problems, in 96 in Mitchell South Dakota they discovered it was the cause of a plethora of severe issues with cats and had to stop using it. The believe it was from the cats ""grooming"" it off their coats after surgery. Too many problems to report here, do your dog a favor and do your own. And don't look get your information from the doggy sites. Look up the problems with the chemical. Is it like declawing your animal? ""And they tell you it doesn't hurt them when they rip the dew claws out at the puppy age?"" Yeah, I'd like to declaw a few vets (Pharma salesmen) and have them give me a report?<br />Most importantly, you do not want to kill ANY bacteria in your dogs system. PERIOD, that's why they've generally for so long, been so healthy, let's not screw that up as we have our own body's with infections causing Irritable bowel diseases etc. TL;DR Poison"
"I am currently on the hcg diet with a strict 500 calories a day.  I have no bowl movement for 4 days, so i decide to try drinking this tea.  I use 12 oz boiling water with one tea bag and drink it after 15 minutes before going to bed.  After 9 hours, I have to go to the bathroom and feel relieved.  This tea works.  I will use it again and recommend to friends. TL;DR Amazing!  It works!"
Carb Krunchers Low Carb Hamburger Buns is very good and I ate it with toast. I like the plain without hamburger.. I will eat hamburger very soon.. I like that very much.. Recommend to all.. TL;DR Carb Krunchers Low Carb
These are great training treats for all my animals and can't beat the price!  I will definitely will keep ordering and there are a lot because they are itty bitty! TL;DR Great for dogs and pigs!
"I've been drinking this tea for years. It's the best on the market for a reasonable price.<br /><br />Since I drink a lot of this tea, I've always tried to buy this larger sized package to save a bit of money. But the larger size is not sold in very many places, so I end up buying the smaller size for what feels like too much money - plus I just have to buy a lot of them.<br /><br />Now I've hit upon the perfect formula: buy these larger boxes in bulk at super low prices on a regular basis. I was just reminded of what a great deal this is because I'm on vacation and had to buy the smaller packages here - for a package of 20, I paid almost what I pay here for 50.<br /><br />If you drink a lot of tea, you can go wrong here. TL;DR great tea, great price"
"I've tried all kinds of flea eradicating products in the past. This is by far the best. It may cost a little more but its worth it. No more bites on my feet and ankles. No lingering smell and no STAINS on furniture. A very quality product. Oh and the person who complained about it having an insecticide in it, well duh. How else is it supposed to work? They all do if they really are going to work.<br /><br />Remove small children and pets for a a couple hours and spray it. Simple as that.<br /><br />5 stars. TL;DR Best flea spray on the market"
"My kids, ages 8, 5, 4, 3 and 2, love the taste of this drink (they did not like the chocolate one).  We mix it with juice and water.  Water help its dissolve better.  I love that I am able to give them extra fruits/veggies each day with one great tasting drink.  Good source of antioxidants and has a wonderful alkalizing effect on their bodies. TL;DR Great Taste, Great Benefits!"
"My husband and I have been on a gluten free diet for a few years now.  The texture of some of the gluten-free breads and most of the gluten-free pasta's is not satisfactory to us.  The majority of the pasta's we tried were mushy - yuk.  But Hearland's pasta products are far from that.  They are the closest thing to ""real"" pasta that we have found.  We can even eat them as left-overs, which we could not do with the mushy pasta's.  I used to buy Heartland's pasta's at Wal Mart at a much cheaper price than I am buying it at Amazon for, but they stopped carrying it.  It is worth the exta money that it costs not to settle for mushy pasta, though. TL;DR Finally, a gluten free pasta that is not mushy."
"I have a Westie with allergies and this product helped quite a bit.  I'm still shopping for the perfect food for my pet, but this is head and shoulders better than Nutro products.  It has fairly limited ingredients which is what you want when messing around with allergies.  Also the really nice thing is that it is baked and when Ivy eats it, her breath smells like cookies which makes kisses much more pleasant !  The product generally rates a 4 out of 6 for ingredients but I'd rate higher than that and give it a 5 out of 6. TL;DR Flint River ranch lamb and rice"
"I admit I have never tasted Tupelo honey prior to ths. I guess I had high expectations since Ulee's Gold and Van Morrison's song praise it so, as do some cooking shows. Sadly it seems no different than bulk honey and it is considerably more expensive. For special honeys, I'll continue with New Zealand and Southern France's incredible delights. TL;DR tastes like run of the mill honey"
"Both of my larg German shepherds have sensitive stomachs and skin. I have not been able to find another dry food that does not have the ingredients they are reactive to. These include: Chicken, Beef, Fish and corn to name a few. They love the food and there have been no allergic reactions for either of them. Awesome! TL;DR Excellent dry food"
"I actually think the soup is quite good. It's not ""low sodium"", but it's not excessive either. It has 560 mg Sodium, so that's 25% of RDA-that's a lot less than what you typically see in canned soups. With the soup base added, I will say there is quite a bit of pepper and onion that I detect, but again, I don't think it's excessive. I decided to go for the creamier version and use a cup of milk with the soupbase instead of 3 Tbsp of water. It's a very nice change of pace. It passed the test with my husband and 9 YO son, so that's pretty impressive. I'm trying to get away from the canned soups (i.e. BPA)and Canterbury Naturals has been a great way to accomplish this. So far we've had the White Chicken Chili, Fireside Tortilla (added ground chicken to it), Tortellini, Farmhouse Curry, and the Chicken Noodle. I think they're all great. Whether the recipe calls for it or not, I am adding ground meat or chicken breast, just to give it more substance so it can be more filling. For the Tortellini soup I added 8oz. of tomato sauce, chicken breast, and an extra package of cheese tortellini-it was filling and GOOD. You can buy most of the flavors in the natural/organic section at Kroger, but they're cheaper on subscribe and save if you really like them. TL;DR LisaZ"
"This product is quite good.  I purchased a package to try before investing in bulk for the ""storm closet.""  They mix easily, no clumps, taste good, nice texture.  I was surprised by how quickly they cook - faster than fresh eggs, imho.  I'm purchasing several cans today. TL;DR Another thumbs up"
"I hate to write a not-so-good review of a product since it's based purely on taste ... which is such a relative thing.<br /><br />Anyhow, I personally prefer my coffee to be sweetened, and this drink wasn't sweet enough for my taste.  Since it's in a can and I drank it on-the-go, I dind't have the opportunity to pour into a glass and sweeten it some more (and who really pours this sort of drink out of the can anyhow?).<br /><br />Now the good stuff ... The portion size was great and would be easy to double stack in most fridges.  The coffee didn't have an artificial flavor and was actually quite good.  I shared a sip with a friend and she liked it very much (again, back to taste being such a subjective thing).<br /><br />Enjoy! TL;DR Taste is such a subjective thing..."
"Stubb's makes a variety of marinades and sauces which are just first rate. This Mesquite Liquid is certainly no exception. When you open the bottle, it smells just like standing next to a Mesquite fire. Full of flavor. We a few drops in our chicken wing marinade tonight, thinking we could always add more later, and I'll have to say, it was enough. It was great!<br /><br />I highly recommend it for your cooking needs. And one bottle is going to go a long way. TL;DR Good Smokey Flavor"
"I have a friend with young twins and these purees were well recieved. They are in a nice pouch, which is cool since those glass jars do occasionally break. And they must have tasted good, as all the packets are gone now. TL;DR 4 thumbs up!"
"Oh My God, these things are addictive and good taste like runts, have ordered twice now, they come very fast and are packaged well TL;DR Gone banana for these"
My jar of Strawberry preserves is gone already.  For some reason our local stores are not selling preserves anymore.  I love fruit in my 'jelly'.  This is the second time I have bought this product and will continue to buy.  My kids love these too. TL;DR Great preserves and worth the price.
"I was about to give away my Keurig until I encountered this coffee.  All other K-cups, no matter what brand, are simply TOO strong.  Timothy's Decaf is heaven compared to what I have been drinking.  I actually had resorted to buying coffee pods and using a nice holder sold here at Amazon to hold the pods in place so they could be treated like a K-Cup.  So if you have been thinking along the same lines, consider Timothy's.  I have had their regular coffees, my next order will be for full caffeine K-cups from them for my morning cup.  This PM cup of Timothy's decaf is the first good coffee I have had since I purchased a Keurig. TL;DR Best coffee for Keurig"
What is going on here?  Why is a 6 oz bag of treats so much? TL;DR Question
"A little high in calories due to the peanut butter, but its delicious and a pretty clean bar. Ive tried all the flavors and this one is by far the best, hence the higher calorie count! TL;DR Awesome!!"
"I've purchased Ginger Altoids in the past, but they are getting harder to find at normal retail outlets.  Good thing Amazon is here.  And at a very good price.<br /><br />Great ginger flavour, lots of zest, just like Ginger Altoids! TL;DR Still loving 'em"
"These are hands-down the absolute best Salt & Vinegar chips you can buy.  They have a great, strong flavor that has left me addicted.  These are certainly my favorite chips.  I highly recommend trying them! TL;DR The Supreme Salt & Vinegar"
"I love this tea. It tastes just like restaurants make when you add sweetened condensed milk (also easier to stir into iced tea than sugar). My only caution is that this stuff stains VERY easily. I used an iced tea maker with a bucket-style coffee filter to brew my tea and spilled a little bit on the counter while I was working and I had giant orange spots where the tea landed within a couple minutes.<br /><br />Also, the bag tells you to use 4 Tbsp per cup of water- that means if you are making a gallon of tea you need to add about 4 cups if you follow the bag! This didn't sound right to me, and I do tend to like my tea strong. I decided to add 1/2c. of the tea per quart  of water and it still turned out pretty strong. TL;DR Tastes just like Thai restaurants.. just avoid using as much as they advise!"
"When I saw this on Oprah a few weeks ago, I was dying to try it. Gail and Oprah said it made their sandwich taste like a BLT without the bacon. Well, sign me up!!! I found its sister product, Bacon Salt, on sale at Today's Goodie (and Baconnaise was backordered everywhere), so I tried it first. LOVED it on eggs, salads, pizza... everything. That same site put Baconnaise on sale and I couldn't resist scooping up a jar. If you love the TASTE of bacon but hate the THOUGHT of it, this stuff is for you. TL;DR Oprah loves it, so had to give it a try! A truly unique flavor!!!"
"Well, the pups love em and they are small enough to fit in their kong as well as a couple other treat dispensing toys.  Will buy again! TL;DR Dogs don't lie!"
"My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order. TL;DR GREAT results with continued use at the prescribed dosage!"
"I've ordered a lot of gum off Amazon, many different brands and flavors.  This is my favorite.  I think anywhere you buy gum, sometimes you get a stale pack or batch, but overall I've been happy enough with the quality and freshness to keep ordering it time and again. TL;DR My favorite sugarfree gum"
I had been looking everywhere here in WV for Altoid Licorice. I couldnot be found. I love it. I am so happy I know where I can get it now. TL;DR Wonderful find
Mudslide is a great chocolate flavored k-cup coffee. Reasonably strong and good tasting for those who like flavored coffee. TL;DR Great coffee
I've lived in Europe--and I know good marzipan.  This was the best.  It is calling YOU!  Get some--you won't regret it.  AG TL;DR Fabulous Marzipan
"I've recently made efforts to eat better and, let me tell you, ALL of Bob's Red Mill products are a godsend. Quinoa is easy to make, versatile, and packs some serious health benefits. The package it comes in doesn't look like much but the seeds cook up to 4 times their size, easily. So a little goes a long way both in that sense and that it's pretty filling too! I use it as a side dish, in soups and stews, and I imagine that with the right ingredients it could be used for breakfast as well!<br /><br />I'm a carb addict and this, while not low carb, is definitely better than the empty and processsed carbs that I used to eat. If you're looking for a low carb option that's similar to rice, check out TVP granules. Only 3 effective carbs per serving and even easier to make than this stuff! TL;DR Delicious AND healthy! Wow!"
Found these at Meijer's. Couldn't wait to try them. I think these are better than the regular chocolate ones. A much better chocolate flavor. Love them! Will be buying these instead of the other ones. TL;DR Fantastic!
"I was charged just as much for shipping as what the product cost!  Over $12 for this small box of coconut creme powder!  I love the product, it tastes rich and wonderful, but I'll find it elsewhere for less than that... TL;DR Shipping is what brought this down to 2 stars"
"My Daughter sent these to my dog Phoebe----She loved these. You can tell because she will roll on them and then try and hide them, finally eating them.Phoebe is a good part Beagle. TL;DR Arf Arf"
Thank you for the product.  I grew up in South America and loved guava. I couldn't find it locally and I am very pleased withthis product!! TL;DR Guava paste
"Sometimes I just want tea but not the caffeine.  Don't want super fruity or spicy.  This one fits the bill.  I generally cannot find this product in the stores in this area, so have to purchase on line.  This is the second case I've purchased -- somehow this tea doesn't fall out of favor with my taste buds unlike most other caffeine-free teas.  Highly recommended (unless you like the fruity spicy varieties). TL;DR Great taste - not too fruity or spicy"
"I was expecting a lot more from this product. However, there was very little flavor and the little flavor it had tasted fake. I have had many ginger team's and ginger based drinks and just about every single one has been better than this one. Pass on this one unless you like drinks with very little flavor. TL;DR Just OK!"
"This powdered stevia is comparable in quality to other brands I have tried. Like other no- or low-calorie sweeteners, stevia is extremely concentrated, so the envelope contains other substances as well, in this case organic agave inulin and silica. Each envelope contains a little over a half teaspoon of powder in all.<br /><br />Each packet claims to sweeten ""like 2 tsp. of sugar."" However, I found it to be comparable to one teaspoon of sugar.<br /><br />While the agave inulin and stevia are organic and this may attract some buyers, in my opinion, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PMSTTE"">Truvia Natural Sweetener, 300-Count Package</a> has a more sugar-like taste. That being said, I strongly prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E3JY"">SweetLeaf SteviaClear Liquid Stevia, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a>. This form of stevia is more economical and a more palatable sweetener than any powdered stevia brand.<br /><br />For any buyers who are new to stevia, I recommend using this in foods, but not in drinks. Stevia always tastes odd to me in beverages, though it may be that one can become accustomed to its unusual taste/aftertaste in time. TL;DR Comparable in taste to other powdered stevia brands"
Stacy's Cinnamon Sugar Pita Chips are the best.  They're sweet (but not too sweet) and crunchy.  They taste like a little bit of heaven.  I love them. TL;DR You're Gonna Love Them
"came on time- Nothing has sprouted yet, unfortunately. I really want all my elm trees to come out and grow to fruition. TL;DR chinese elm tree"
"I know this is not a real cappuccino but I think it tastes pretty good and is so easy in my Keurig, which was a Christmas gift from my kids.  It has been an adventure trying all the products out there in Kcups, some are hits and some are misses and for me this is a hit. TL;DR like this"
I so enjoyed both cooking and eating these and so did my mother and I plan to order again :) TL;DR Delicious!!!
"I live in a small apartment and don't have room for lots of gadgets (not even a microwave). I find this appliance to be worth the counter space.  I like that you can steam and puree in one appliance, and that I don't have to lug out the steamer and blender to whip up some food.<br /><br />Some reviewers say your baby will outgrow this machine's usefulness in a few months but I disagree. My baby eats mostly finger foods but still I use the Beaba a lot. I use it to reheat leftovers (again, we have no microwave) and also use it to chop or puree adult dinners that are two hard for baby to eat.<br /><br />It's not a huge capacity but that doesn't bother me. After spending whole weekends steaming, blending and freezing veggies, just to discover that my kid's taste buds changed and what he once loved he now refuses, I'm over large scale baby food production.<br /><br />One safety note!  There is a little hole that the lid clicks into. That hole leads to the water chamber and I once accidentally tipped the machine over and scalding hot water came out of the hole and landed on my hand.  I got a nasty burn.  Definitely keep this machine well away from the edge of counters! TL;DR Useful especially if you have a small kitchen, one safety concern though"
I have used this product in the past and was having trouble finding it in the stores in my community.  It was delightful to find it online and be able to make my special chicken spaetzle soup! TL;DR Excellent!
"I grew up in Vermont and my grandparents still make/bottle maple syrup every year so I know a thing or two about this stuff. I got this when it was on sale. Personally, I like the Medium Amber. It's not as thick as Dark, and the Light is almost like water. Grade A is best for Pancakes and French Toast. Grade B is better for Baking and putting on top of Ice Cream. I ordered this and it arrived in 2 days via Amazon Prime. The product is great. TL;DR Great Syrup"
I love this tea.  My Mom got me hooked on it.  It is a little spicy and has a sweet after taste. TL;DR No sugar needed
"After seeing these quick, single-portion snacks in the market I decided to order a large package to keep them in the pantry to satisfy those sweet-treat cravings.  The product is disappointing in both it's size and quality.  A slightly more generous portion would help to satisfy the late night snack urge; the quality is okay.  I ultimately decided not to keep these in stock in the pantry - they don't quite hit the mark. TL;DR A Quick but Disappointing Fix for the Sweet-Tooth"
Seed kit arrived quickly and my plants are currently growing strong.  Can't wait to begin the harvest! TL;DR Very Satisfied
"I'd seen ice wine tea from another online seller -- one who wanted half again as much for the tea and twice as much for the shipping. A little Googling found CulinaryTeas both on Amazon and on their own website, and I'm glad I did the comparison shopping since I ordered several CulinaryTeas teas and like them all. (Personally, next time I'll order straight from their own website rather than through Amazon, because I wanted to add something else to my order and the owner said that she could do that for orders through their own site but not through Amazon's system due to Amazon's separately calculated shipping fees and such. I did figure out how to combine orders through Amazon, but talking to the owner also provided recommendations about other teas to try in the future.)<br /><br />One thing I particularly like about CulinaryTeas' setup is the ability to order by the ounce or by larger quantities, and to choose between a tea tin and a resealable bag. Since I'm ordering for a local tea-sampling club, the resealable bag is better for me since I distribute most of the tea to the members and have a small sample of my own left and can 'squish' the bags down into a smaller space. The large tins with a teaspoon or two of tea left in the bottoms just take up too much space until I get around to brewing and drinking my samples from the month's teas.<br /><br />People who are buying purely for themselves will probably want the tins, since most people don't go through 4 oz. of tea in one afternoon's mad bagging spree and would want something tidy and stackable for long-term storage. But since we're buying several teas as a group to maximize our 'tea-sampling' potential and distributing our sampled teas to each other, the bags work better in our situation.<br /><br />About this particular ice wine tea -- it smells and tastes wonderful, with floral-and-intensely-grape-and-wine scents and tastes. I've made it both hot and iced, and I liked it both ways -- going into summer I'm more likely to drink it iced for the next few months, of course. CulinaryTeas also offers flavor blends I've never seen anywhere else, and I'm looking forward to tasting my various samples! TL;DR Good hot or iced, with a lovely floral-fruity-wine scent"
"My favorite thing to do is make muffins for my family with this great mix. I add raisins, nuts, even canned pineapple, or sour cherries to the batter, which I make into cupcakes. This is great for us celiacs, if you can keep them away from other members of the family!<br /><br />Elinor in Kennewick<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKXGKU/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img TL;DR Love this Spice cake mix!"
"Mmmmm, yummm, mmm, mmmm, slurp, mmmmm, boy, mymm, chomp, mmm, is this, mmmm, mmmuuyumm, goooood!...mmm, excuse...mmmm, me,  while, oh wow, mmmm, I eat...mmmmm! TL;DR Lip smackin'"
"My Chinese Crested absolutely loves this food.  She loved it so much I had to buy the larger box and make it part of her regular diet.  She lights up when she see me reach for the box in the cabinet and sits ever so patiently as I prepare it.  Normally she will not eat all of her kibble, but mix a little of this with it and presto it's all gone!! TL;DR Guarentee your pooch will love it!"
"Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy - I thought the name spelled out what I was looking for, but the only way this could help your scalp is to apply it directly to the scalp.  The consistency of the product is very much like shortening ... and requires as much shampoo to get it out of your hair as if you had used shortening.  It has a nice, but very strong fragrance.  If you are looking for dry scalp relief, keep looking (and please let me know if you find something!). TL;DR Seems like it's more a hair treatment than a scalp treatment"
"I love hot teas, and I thought I would like this sampler. While the flavors taste good, I have found none of them is sufficiently strong after brewing.  The flavors and weak and mellow even with proper brewing.  I do like the idea of the flavors and the silk bags, but will continue to drink other hot teas. TL;DR Not Impressed with the Strength of Flavor"
My baby just turn 1yr old and she never had any problem on<br />Transition fr her Infant Soy to this Toddler. Same taste<br />Maybe but definitely same smell:) TL;DR Stomach problem free
"This has been a surprising taste treat for our whole family.  While I don't think these taste like something similar I remember eating a few years ago (but who can trust that kind of memory?), I do think they are really good.  And so does my husband and 3 kids!  Very good product. TL;DR Yummy for the whole family."
"This Barista Prima Italian roast is suppose to be full bodied with a sweet edge.  It is not.  It is Medium-Bold (not extra bold), and has a bitter taste and a distinct aftertaste.  Milk & sugar help, but the bitter and aftertaste are still there.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL512"">Tully's Coffee Italian Roast, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> is a much better choice if you want a good Italian blend.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers. TL;DR Medium to Bold, but Not Real Bold.  Bitter with a Distinct Aftertaste."
"I have no complaints - my dogs absolutely love these treats. The shipping is super fast, the packaging is perfect to keep the treats in one piece and the price was great! Flawless transaction! TL;DR wonderful as usual"
"My cas love this high quality, healthy food. Wellness pouches are a great food for all cats of all ages. TL;DR Wellness Pouches"
"This is my go-to brand and flavor, since I can't find any Ichiban ramen on Subscribe  and Save. One of the 'top-drawer' choices of ramen. TL;DR Great alternative."
"I have never been to Jamaica, but a good friend who spent some time there was getting very frustrated looking for a jerk in U.S. that matched that of the jerk in Jamaica.....until he found Walkerswood. He introduced it to my wife and I, and we haven't stopped using ot since!<br /><br />It goes great on everything, and has just the right balance of spice & sweet! Jerk lovers that haven't tried it are seriously missing out. TL;DR The Best!!"
"I bought this sample pack of K-cups to go along with the coffee maker I bought my sister for Christmas.  I received a great variety of flavors, a few duplicates, but overall a very nice selection.  I saw some of the other reviews complained they only received a couple of different flavors.  I can not say the same.  There were at least a dozen different flavors in the box.<br /><br />The packaging isn't so great.  The cups just come loose in the brown box they are shipped in.  Not a big deal if you are buying them for your own use, however I will have to find a small box to gift these in.  But the price was right and they arrived in 3 days - overall I am pleased. TL;DR Great variety"
"I always order Purina Pro Plan cat food from Amazon, as with Amazon Prime I receive prompt two day service with no shipping cost.  I am handicapped and cannot get out to shop and this is a tremendous asset to me!!<br />HOWEVER, this order was shipped incorrectly....instead of one ""Salmon"" and 1 ""Chicken"", I received two bags of ""Chicken with Rice"". As it is too difficult for me to return one, can you send 1 ""Salmon"" at N/C or a reduced rate to compensate for the inconvenience TL;DR Dry Cat Food"
Being Dutch- Indonesian I NEED my Ketjap Manis and here it was at great price. It came quickly In time for me to marinate  Some Baby back ribs.  I used some marinade to glaze the ribs just before they finished smoking. The vote was the best ribs ever. Thanks to the secret ingredient ABC KECAP MANIS!( I prefer the spelling as Ketjap) TL;DR ABC KECAP MANIS
"I LOVE this cacao - I use it in so many recipes- especially 'raw' recipes.  YUM!!  It is especially good in my morning smoothies with bananas, avocado, almond milk, wheat germ, chia seeds and ice- YUMMM is all i can say! TL;DR YUMMM!!!"
"Chocolate bar-check! Ginormous marshmallows-check! Big box o' graham crackers-check! Make one, two, three s'mores. Wow, that's really way too sweet to deal with more than once a year.<br />So, the rest of the chocolate bar is gone before the evening is out. A couple of the marshmallows get thrown into cocoa before they become puffy rocks and they get tossed or the dog snags the bag.<br />But the crackers? They get put back into the box and go back up on the shelf by the high fiber stick cereal you really should eat instead of swiping the kid's sugar pellets. On a quest for snacks 3 months later  you find the sad, super stale remains falling out of the inadequate wax paper wrap and opt for a bowl of crispy twigs instead.<br />Not any longer! Honey Maid has changed up the way they package graham crackers to better mesh with life today. The smaller packs fit easily in purses, diaper bags, or the outside pocket of the gym bag.<br />It's a great size for sharing. The opaque plastic wrap you've known and loved from Premium Saltines now protects the slightly sweet wholesomeness of eight 2 3/8-inch  square Honey Maid crackers.<br />When opened, you get to experience the aroma of super fresh crackers. And two weeks later when you open another package -- they're still super fresh and crispy. Great idea Nabisco!<br />Nom, nom, nom! TL;DR New packaging fits better with modern life"
This tea smells great.  You can see the cinnamon and orange but the taste is not that great.  It is ok...not good and not bad.  It is a great value and you get a lot of tea.  I don't plan on buying this again but I am not sorry that I tried it. TL;DR Ok tea but not quite my taste
"Our two kittens love this food. So much that they rarely eat their dry food now... We mix the dry food in now every morning and night, and they will eat it that way. Great price! TL;DR Kittens love it"
"In the interest of healthier diet and more adventurous cooking - I ordered this product, hoping to replace other salts in my diet. I was somewhat surprised by the smell, and disappointed that there are no instructions as to equivalents in cooking on the packaging. Any advice as to how I can learn to use this product properly? TL;DR Questions about the product"
"This is black tea infused with natural passionfruit flavor. It's a nice tea but the problem here is that without reading the label you probably wouldn't identify passionfruit (unlike Kwong Sang's Mango or Wild Cherry, which are unmistakeable). This may not be Kwong Sang's fault; it's likely that passionfruit is simply harder to indentify. I think this tea could benefit from a little tartness. TL;DR Kwong Sang Passionfruit Tea"
"I have tryed a lot of Beef Jerky but, I must say this is the ""greatest"" I have eaten..Just try it you will say the same...finger licking good! and it does'nt chew like a piece of leather either...<br />  Bettie In Ohio TL;DR ""The Greatest"""
"I have to say I liked these.  The blueberry flavor is nice and the brown sugar keeps them from tasting too much like saltines.  They are crunchy, but thin, so not like a cookie.  They are more like a hard Ritz cracker.  I did notice after swallowing an odd after-taste that I cannot quite place.  It tastes a little like the carroway seeds from rye bread.  It wasn't bad, though, and it was gone pretty quickly.<br /><br />A couple of these will tide you over between meals, and the nutritional value is pretty good for a treat. TL;DR Tasty, but funny aftertaste"
"I have been devouring Yaya's herb popcorn regularly since I discovered it about 6 months ago.  It is incredibly addictive.  I buy 4 bags every week or two.  I would like to buy more, but I feel like I should leave some for others.  When I go to pay, the clerks often say, ""This stuff is SO GOOD!""  To which I always answer, ""Yeah, I know,"" and quickly shuffle away, trying to pretend like I'm not buying out their store.  I highly recommend it for anyone who even remotely likes popcorn.  There is no competitor for Yaya's herb. TL;DR This Popcorn is THE BEST!"
"Miracle Gro for acid loving plants is an absolute must for any home owner or bonsai lover with plants that do not require alkaline fertilizers. This product will perk up your azaleas, mountain laurels, rhododendrons, and evergreens to keep them healthy and green. This is an outstanding excellent product. TL;DR Miracle-Gro Acid Food"
"I am one of those people who has a disgustingly ravenous sweet tooth. Almost any sweet treat will do but of late I have been making an effort to go for fruit over cookies. But come on, everyone deserves a real sugary snack now and again. Candy bars and pints of ice cream have been my vices in the past but the humble cookie is the one I go for when I want to feel like I'm eating a lot when I'm not really. When I saw these cookies offered on Amazon's Vine I skipped them in favor of books and went out and bought a box (to conduct my very own taste test review) because they sounded good. I'm glad I did because I love these!<br /><br />Newtons Fruit Thins are hardly Double Stuf Oreos as far as sweetness goes but if you enjoy the classic Fig Newton this one is like a crunchy cousin. A little bit cinnamony with a graham-crackery note of honey and little nibs of fig sprinkled through-out. If you like graham-crackers or crispy oatmeal cookies these will probably be a delight. Certainly they're not for everyone and it's a matter of personal likes but these are hardly the tasteless bits of cardboard others have suggested they are. I believe it is fair to compare them to tea biscuits, these the aren't sugar-coma inducing cookies your 8-year-old is going to demand. These are more of a grown-up cookie--as my grandma likes to say ""I'm not old, I'm mature""--but I've been debating sharing one with my toddler to see what she thinks.<br /><br />Overall I think these are lovely, just the right amount of sweet, crunchy goodie for a post-lunch treat. I'm looking forward to trying one of the other varieties soon! TL;DR A Cookie for Grown-Ups"
"I ordered these for our small law firm since clients occasionally ask for decaf coffee but it happens so rarely that it is not cost effective to keep decaf coffee beans on hand. Also, it saves the time of having to brew an entirely new pot of coffee. No one can tell that the coffee is out of a packet. It dissolves quickly into a very strong brew.<br /><br />Highly recommended for people who occasionally need just a few cups of coffee. TL;DR Great single servings"
"It's a different box, but the ingredients look, smell and taste the same so what's the big deal.  It seems to me that all this is, is the same old product in a new box.  OK, new and improved(?) box. But the inside seems exactly the same and the preparation and taste are the same.  It's sad to think that some one in R&D at Kraft said, ""hey, let's add the word Veggie or Vegetarian or Vegan to that old standby Mac-N-Cheese and see how many people we can fool into thinking that it's a new product"".  So I'm cynical...can you blame me.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz TL;DR Uh-It's Mac-n-Cheese"
"We just got our Keurig for Christmas, but really wanted to try samples of all the coffees. This was the best option, I was a little worried from the reviews, but its nothing like it others have said. My cups came in a box that was packaged with an expiration date on the outside, some of the cups come with their own expiration dates. None of the cups were damaged, or even dusty like others have said. I ended up getting 20 different flavors. So a majority of them I got two of one flavor. Which I am fine with cause then my husband and I both get to try them. I am very happy with the product, and cant wait to order again. TL;DR Very Pleased."
"I have 3 dogs ranging from puppy to 3 years, all different breeds and sizes- and all 3  sniffed this and then walked away. Waste of my money :( TL;DR Not impressed"
Delicious peppermint xylitol gum that prevents cavities when you chew and bad breath. It comes in a convenient 100 ct. jar. I had a good experience with this company. TL;DR Spry Gum
"My 1 year old loves Cerelac.<br />It's delicious and filling. Though, not all flavors are liked by my son, the wheat and milk one is by far the best.<br /><br />I highly recommend it. TL;DR Perfect!"
I bought two types of peppers from you but neither were labeled. It would be nice if I knew the differences in the peppers. TL;DR no label
"great bags that do exactly what I need them to :) wish they made other color options (i.e....all green, all yellow, etc). but would recommend them for their functionality & price TL;DR useful bags"
"Discovered coconut water this summer and I love it!  It tastes great and is very refreshing.  We took some bottles with us when hiking on hot summer days and the coconut water kept us going.  It's very high in natural electrolytes (potassium, I think) and surprisingly low in calorie. TL;DR My new favorite!"
"I have a pretty finicky feline. I was a little nervous about trying something new, but it was recommended to me. It has been a huge hit. I don't feed canned food daily, and now she really wants it daily. She absolutely loves it. It is a great price and a great food. TL;DR Happy cat"
"At least half of my cans came dented.  And they were packed that way, not dented in transit.  **** Also, be sure to call the company to ask if they are Product of Thailand or Product of Sri Lanka.  (It is printed on the back of the cans.) They have a different supplier in Sri Lanka which waters down the milk -- the cans sound like water when you shake them, not like thick creamy coconut milk (as in the Thailand cans).  And it is NOT that the flesh settles to the bottom -- it is watery all the way through.  Completely different product and the watered down cans just don't produce as nice a product in the kitchen :(.  Beware. TL;DR Dented Cans & AVOID The Product of SRI LANKA cans"
"My whole family seemed to eat these like they were candy I know they are better than candy but, I don't think they are an actual health food. TL;DR Tastes like candy all ages will enjoy these"
"I love Chupa Chups. Trust me, I am very happy that this product is for sale on Amazon. Unfortunately, however, the folks who wrote reviews about the lack of selection were correct.<br /><br />I appreciated the reviewer who broke his 100 lollipops down by flavor - I will do the same thing here (below).<br /><br />These are the four flavors guaranteed to be inside this container, based on the web page on Amazon and the outside packaging of the pops (it lists the 4 flavors on the outside of the container). It's false advertising, for the most part.<br /><br />Strawberry Yogurt = 54<br /><br />Mango Yogurt = 1<br /><br />Chocolate & Vanilla Ice Cream = 26<br /><br />Strawberries & (Vanilla) Cream = 19<br /><br />I am giving this product 3 stars because it was basically a quality product (meaning I could consume/use the contents). I took away 2 stars for the promise of the presence of 4 flavors. I've read all the arguments that these are ""random"" selections, but let's face it: some flavors are more popular than others. In my batch, more than half were one flavor; this dispels the myth of randomness, since picking from 4 categories ""at random"" (mathematically) would not result in this extreme dispensation of flavors, for example 54 Strawberry Yogurts.<br /><br />You won't regret buying these, because they are delicious and awesome. You may want to shop around for a better selection, though - especially if you're a fan of all the flavors, like I am. I would have really loved an assortment.<br /><br />Enjoy your sweets, wherever ye may find them. Thanks for reading. TL;DR Delicious treats... LIMITED selection!"
"If you are looking for a tasty snack or a quick breakfast at work, these are great. I have an ongoing shipment setup to send these to where I work, and as a result I haven't missed breakfast in weeks. TL;DR Best internet purchase yet"
"This is a really tasty snack cracker. My kids love to eat these right out of the box but we really like them over tomato soup, they're also great adding 1 cup to homemade chex mix.  Another favorite is to finely crush 1 cup hot & spicy cheezits and mix into 2lbs of ground beef, I add a little worchestershire sauce, one egg, and some garlic salt and then make my own hamburger patties.  It makes 8 quarter lb patties.  They are fantastic that way and everyone will love your hamburgers.  If you want a little more kick then add pepper jack cheese but we just use american slices.  These are our favorite of all the cheez-its.<br /><br />*Just a note that this is the 9oz box and not the normal 13.7oz box so just beware when comparing prices at the grocery. TL;DR Great with Tomato Soup, in Chex Mix and Hamburger Patties!"
the after taste was slightly different.... I did not like it.....maybe it is something in the cereal that is artificial....don't know...will not buy anymore of it....  Quaker high fiber cinnamon swirl.....am returning it to the grocery store..... package has 2013 date on it.... that means that it is fresh... but the aftertaste is not good.... TL;DR bad after taste
"One of the best crackers for crackers with cheese or just for munching,  Not salty, like a lot of crackers.  Enough flavor to enhance the cheese but not so much that it overwhelms.  Sounds like a cliche, but it really is a healthy cracker that tastes good. TL;DR Great cracker"
Found the same product in Target and it only cost a bit more than a quarter of the price listing here. TL;DR Over priced!
These licorice wheels are exactly like the ones you get from the candy stands where you pay for the candy by weight.  The only difference is that this one is very fresh.  The taste is very good - the way strawberry licorice wheels should taste.  The texture is better.  You get a good strawberry licorice smell every time you open the package. TL;DR Fresher than the candy stand's
I love these tea bags - you have a pitcher of tea ready to drink (and cold) within 20-30 minutes!  Buying in bulk is also a great value for the money. TL;DR Cold Iced Tea in Less Than 30 minutes!!
"I used to enjoy Crown Prince brand when I was growing up, so I went ahead and bought the 12 pack since I'm trying to increase my daily calcium intake.<br /><br />I found the sardines to be a bit too ""mushy"" and the vinegar in the mustard to be quite overpowering.  Also, one of the five boxes I opened so far had already partially split along the seam where you peel off the top and some of the contents had seeped out, suggesting possible spoilage.  It certainly isn't safe to eat from that can.  I plan to contact Crown Prince once I finish the twelve pack in case any more cans are partially open.<br /><br />I'll finish this pack, but I don't intend to buy any more of the Crown Prince in mustard and will experiment with a different brand instead. TL;DR Ok, but definately not the best sardines"
They said the salt and vinegar were horrible! Blecht! Couldn't get the awful taste out of their mouth. Now i'm stuck with this box of popchips! lol. TL;DR Bought it for kids and wife
"I recently bought this box of Oolong tea a few weeks ago.  Generally I drink it at least twice a day.  Most of the time at room temperature.  It is an excellent tea with a very nice and smooth flavor.  Although it is free of caffeine I have found myself feeling more awake after drinking it.  At the same time I feel more energy I also feel as though I am able to think clearer.  It may not be a wonder tea that some people claim but it can do more for mind, body, and spirit than most vitamin pills claim to do. TL;DR A Wonderful Natural Tea that has been Ignored Too Long"
"After having Illy at the espresso bars in Italy, well, no other espresso tasted good to me! Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine. It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine (e.g., a low end Krups) and a Moka (an Italian poor-man's espresso maker). The rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts. Everyone I've made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores.<br /><br />A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine: Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee. The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee.<br /><br />If you can't find Illy a good runner-up is Lavazza, however, its flavor isn't as intense as Illy. TL;DR Illy is by far the best tasting espresso"
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:33 Mins<br /><br /></span>I ordered two cases of this.  The one I got in a gift<br />basket, was just great.  It was cream style corn, nice and creamy.<br /><br />But, the ones I ordered directly from Glory, turned out to be just plain old whole corn!!  I would bother ordering this.  Watch the video, you be the judge.<br /><br />I sent them an email, wait to see what happens? TL;DR Suppose to be cream corn, but is whole corn, nothing more."
"My cat usually loves treats so I thought this would be a great way to give him antibiotics he had to take for ten days since he hates taking pills.<br /><br />I tried giving him one without a pill earlier in the day just because I thought it might be easier to trick him with the pill in it later and he wouldn't even touch it without the pill in it, even though he loves treats.  I guess if he would have liked the trick, it might have worked good.  I have also tried putting the pill in a bowl of canned food and he figured out how to eat all the food leaving just the tiny (size of a baby asprin)pill in the bowl while eating everything else.  My mom and dad tried it on their cat and he liked the treat but figured out how to get the pill out, so that is another concern.<br /><br />I would recomend the pill pusher instead.  It's fast and you know the cat has taken the pill. TL;DR My cat didn't like the treats"
"Reading the reviews on this coffee flavor, it appears Timothy's has some real quality control issues in this particular flavor of coffee.<br /><br />I drink a lot of flavored coffee and its rare to see a set of reviews where so many people think its the best flavor ever and so many others hate it completely.  The coffee I got is not drinkable without cream or sugar - there is a strong taste of some type, but its not pumpkin, or spice, or coffee - just some bitter unrecognizable strong taste.<br /><br />It's so bad I am contemplating throwing the rest away after I tried about six cups. TL;DR Barely drinkable - and I usually love flavored coffee!"
"I bought the Harmony House diced freeze dried potatoes for use in my backpacking meals, repacked with the other veggies and stuff, they make a great stew. TL;DR Freeze Dried Tater bits"
"I always bought these at Food Lion and they stopped selling them.  My cat loves these treat and I get them in Tuna, Caribbean Catch and Seafood. TL;DR Soft Cat Treats"
"Ordered these for a friend of mine since she remembered them from her childhood. She was awesomely impressed and loved the gift. We ALL shared one of them and it was very good.  I really wish these were available locally, I would buy them on a regular basis! TL;DR Yum"
"I got the savory chicken flavor for our dog, and he totally loves it. He'll perform any trick just to get some licks. It's easy to use and there's no mess. Great idea for a product! I plan to buy more! TL;DR Tasty, easy, no mess!"
"I am in love with these little bunnies! they taste soo darn good!<br />I once saw a deal for them on amazon which made them like 0.62 cents a pack.. so i gave it a try and Im glad I did..<br /><br />They are Vegan, which means gelatin free (woohoo, its hard to find gelatin-free gummies), made with organic fruit juices, fat free; and naturally gluten free..<br /><br />Just an alert though, They are a bit pricey and there are not many fruit snacks in each pouch, but it's the price we pay for organic and healthier snacks. But i guess I can find them at other stores and possibly hopefully they can release a coupon for it? ( pretty pretty please??)<br /><br />But overall, I love it, my kids love it, so I just wanted to let it out there..<br />I talked about it on my blog:<br />[...] TL;DR LOVE LOVE LOVE IT"
"I made this for my family last night hoping that because they love velveeta shells and cheese that they would love this Cheeseburger Mac.  Unfortunately, once you add the seasoning and it's all made, it just tastes like Hamburger Helper, which we're not fans of.  You couldn't really even tell that it was a Velveeta product.  The cheese packet in it is the signature Velveeta gooey cheese in the foil.  I think the problem for me was the seasoning mix they ask you to add when you add the water and pasta.  If I would have left that out then it might have tasted like the cheesy taste I was looking for.<br /><br />If your family likes Hamburger Helper and one skillet meals like that, then you will probably love this as it was a little bit better than those meals... but I won't be buying this again. TL;DR Too much like Hamburger Helper..."
"I love this soup.  It's easy to make when you come home from working all day, and I love to add different vegetables to it and make it my own.  Great for a cold, crisp day. TL;DR Best Soup Ever"
"Bought a box to eat at work for late nights. Good quality noodles and soup. Noodles will soak up soup, so eat after 4 or 5 mins after you put the boiling water in or else the noodles get bloated but surprisingly not soggy.<br /><br />Perfect with some tabasco, fresh scallions, maybe a hard boiled egg or just alone.<br /><br />MUCH better than the other cup-o-noodles TL;DR Great tasting Instant Noodle"
"Another recall? I will never buy their crappy food again! Our pets deserve better than this.  Seriously, this is ridiculous.... TL;DR DONE WiTH DIAMOND!"
Great deal and it tastes great. What else can you ask for. I always run out of certain spices I use a lot of. This way I can buy in larger amounts save money and time. I was afraid it would be poor quality but it really tasted amazing. I'm going to look into buying other spices from them when I run out. TL;DR good deal
Blue Buffalo Probably has one of the best Cat foods on the market for Cats... No Artificial Filers No useless junk. Both my Cats love it. TL;DR One of the Best Brands My Cats love
The product is as advertised.  Very good chocolate.  It is a good alternative for those who do not drink coffee. TL;DR Tasty
"These are hard and not particularly flavorful. I had buyer's regret. The description of them led me to think they would be great, but not so. TL;DR Disappointed"
"A buttery, crisp, not terribly sweet, crunchy delight. Either alone, or accompanied by iced or hot tea and/or a bowl of Sharon's All Berry Sherbet or Sorbet. TL;DR delizioso"
"Quinoa has longevity if nothing else, it has pedigree and is recognized as a superior source of nourishment. Popular in Peru used to be the food of choice for the less privileged. Why? Because grains and potatoes where everywhere in large amounts and the poor could always eat that.<br />Quinoa in America, on the other hand, has taken a lot more classy reputation and very well deserved, may I add. First thing to consider: It is unique and has a long history. Extremely regional grain. Second thing to consider: How really really good is for the human body (google it, yahoo it, very high standards as a food choice). Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa is top of the line Quinoa. Washed over and over so it looses a possible bitter aspect and turns the Quinoa as a wonderful resource and should I include: Tasty? Yes, very tasty and here goes my personal best (to put my money where my mouth is), this is a sure proof way to enjoy a plate of Quinoa.<br />I cup Bob's Red Mill Organic Whole Grain Quinoa/2 1/2 - 3 Cups of Delicious Vegetable or Chicken Broth (never Beef!)/Cook at medium heat until Quinoa is fully cooked and most liquid is absorbed (please note that sometimes Quinoa becomes thirsty and needs additional liquid, specially a higher temperatures)/Planters Peanuts (4 Oz or as much as you want and may be any other nut for that matter, but peanut is Yummy!)grinded to a fine powder-set aside/Dice in fine pieces an onion (small, large, who's counting?) and Heat some Olive/Canola/Vegetable, etc Oil on a large frying pan/Add Fresh Garlic-Crushed Pepper (the better the pepper the better the taste!)Sea or Regular Salt (See? I am not picky!) at this point your most trusted herbs and spices can go into the mix/Add the Peanut powder on the mix and then add the Quinoa fully cooked and mix it all together/Last but certainly not least Add Curry Hot or Mild, I don't care, about 2 teaspoons-more or less, do not let this part stop you-and at the end make sure you add a little more liquid so the whole thing looks and tastes like it should.<br />Curry, Peanuts, Quinoa! Oh Boy, do they get along well. 5 Stars for this food from the Inkas To The Tables! PS: Since I already got into it please note that the curry powder is dissolved at the start together with the broth! It surely does not go at the end when everything is fully cooked, thank you for your understanding on this matter! TL;DR Incas To The Tables!"
"Excellent and really fantastic addition to Good Earth's lineup. The cocoa-taste is noticeable but not overpowering and as some have noted, it is a great tea to help curb a sweet tooth. Why though does the only case-price available here ($35) work out to be $5.83 a box when you can buy this for $4/box in most stores, and all the other Good Earth lineup via Amazon are approx $18-$20 case? Weird.<br /><br />(*Edit* - Nov 20 2010) = Looks like the $35 price has been corrected and this is now inline with the other Good Earth on the site at around $19 - good stuff. TL;DR Good Earth Cocoa Chai = tasty"
"Arrived one day early! Thanks so much, now I have breakfast taken care of for a month! Delicious warm. If there was one complaint it is that I'd rather have the banana flavor than the apple - perhaps consider uploading a new photo to avoid confusion. TL;DR Great Delivery!"
"... I'd rather have half or quarter the amount if the quality was better.  There are plenty of flower tops and the quality in all respects is there except when it comes to flavor and active ingrediants.  On those two characteristics, it's just a big bag of mid-grade product that doesn't come close to a fine grade of European tea. TL;DR Lots of tea for the money ... but ..."
"The manufacturer does have a quality control problem.  Sometimes the can is full of meat chunks with very little ""gravy"" and sometimes the consistency is like soup with very little meat chunks.  The dog likes it either way. TL;DR they do have a quality control problem"
"I'm in a house with 3 celiacs that love some dessert.  We have tried every brownie we can find.  This mix is the BEST GF brownie we have had to date.  I have baked them when we had friends over and the enjoyed the brownies and would not have guessed they were GF.  You can add extra items such as nuts, chocolate chips, etc if you like extras.  The sugar content is quite high for these.  So if you watch sugar grams, you should be aware of this.  Serve this warm with some vanilla ice cream and you have a great GF dessert.<br /><br />Also, the price for the box of six that I bought was great.  In the grocery store, these can be $3.50 - $5.00 a box. TL;DR Best GF brownie mix"
"Product is good, Amazon/Feldcamp should correct nutritional info. It states 120 cal, 10 from fat but in reality it's 130 cal and 20 from fat. It's not a big deal but kind of important.<br />I am getting their whole rye, too. This bread has more fiber and fewer net carbs comparing to whole rye but also more calories - flaxseed is almost 45% fat. So, if you need more fiber and don't mind a little fat then this particular bread is great. Taste is pretty good, too. And the price is right. Thank you, Amazon! TL;DR Bread is great but please correct info"
"My 13 year old daughter has to eat gluten free and this pizza dough is great.  I make a 9 X 13 sheet and bake without toppings.  I slice it up individually and freeze separately for later.  When she wants pizza I just pull one out, defrost in microwave, add toppings and bake.  I added a sprinkle of garlic powder before the toppings as she likes the extra garlic. TL;DR Great for gluten free pizza"
"This is the perfect dipping chocolate.  Makes excellent chocolate covered Oreos, fruit, etc.  Comes in a large bar. TL;DR Yummy!"
"Both my husband and I like the Quinoa and Whole Grain Brown Rice with Garlic very much.  Unfortunately our Costco no longer carries it, so will have to pay more for it at Amazon but we like it well enough to pay the higher price! TL;DR Love it!"
"Jocalat bars are made by the Larabar Company. The following applies to all Larabars and Jocalat bars:<br /><br />* All natural.<br /><br />* No added sugars.<br /><br />* No chemicals/preservatives.<br /><br />* No soy.<br /><br />* Nothing bad/only healthy ingredients.<br /><br />* Vegan-friendly.<br /><br />* Convenient. (No measuring, cutting, pouring, mixing, cooking, etc.)<br /><br />* Because they are healthy and convenient, they are good to have for when you are hungry and have no means to cook or buy something. They can curb your appetite and give you energy. They are also good for snacks.<br /><br />If I were to have an emergency food supply, Larabars and Jocalats would be in the box, (even though I don't know what the shelf life is for them.)<br /><br />Now about this particular flavor, Chocolate Hazelnut Jocalat:<br /><br />I love hazelnut.<br /><br />If you are used to eating candy bars, you might not like these bars at first. I do not eat candy bars (I can't remember the last time I've had one), and I am used to ""healthy-tasting"" foods; therefore, the taste of these bars are perfect for me. I love them. TL;DR Chocolate Hazelnut"
"These are so tasty! I had tasted dilly beans for the first time at a craft fair about a week before I ordered these.  I didn't buy them then, but I found myself regretting that very much. I found these and I had to have them. They're even yummier than the ones I first tasted! If I could, I'd give these much more than five stars.  I just ordered another two jars--they're just that good! TL;DR DELICIOUS!!!"
"Planters peanuts are awesome :)<br /><br />The quantity sold here is not that great of a deal. Sam's club has many more peanuts for the money, probably about 3X better value per pound?!<br /><br />So will I buy these again? No. Are they great peanuts? No doubt, but they are much cheaper bought locally in larger quantities. Peace out TL;DR Great Peanuts, Not So Great Value"
I bought this for my niece for Christmas. She loves it...the bamboo showed up intact and looking gorgeous and green in the middle of December. TL;DR Very pleased
"Product was delivered well packed. Smell and flavor are excellant. Didn't expect the product before we needed it, but it arrived by priority mail in days. TL;DR Pure Maple Extract"
"Wasn't a warm tea drinker until I discovered Big Train Chai.  Now I can't get enough of it.  The spice and chocalate chais are great too. Also, the 1.9 pound canisters are very convenient. TL;DR Love It!!!"
"Unfortunately I am highly disappointed with this product. It is devoid of flavor. They pride themselves on the history of the product. I could've done better at my grocery store in the candy aisle. I would've actually preferred a Heath bar. I tried it on three different days thinking possibly it was me. Then I had a couple friends try a couple pieces and my assessment was proved to be correct.<br />I threw away the majority of the two pound container one hour before the trash collectors arrived so the Raccoons (which often find their way into the garbage no matter what precautions you take) wouldn't have to suffer eating it.<br />What a waste of my hard-earned money. You'll notice if you search Google how dominant this company is.<br />Believe me, I nor will anyone I know ever waste a penny on this product again. Yes, this review seems harsh; but I rarely take the time to do this. The only reason I have, is so you don't waste your money.<br />Regards to all:<br />Ron TL;DR Taste"
I've been eating Quaker Instant Oatmeal for years. I like most of the flavors ( even the plain ) and the banana cream is wonderful but they only sell it in the variety pack. I figured this would taste just as good as the banana cream so I ordered it. That was a mistake. This was terrible ! It had almost no taste and the taste it had was that of a diet after-taste. That's the only way to explain it. It has a chemical and paste taste...if that makes sense. I thought of donating it to my local foodbank but I feel bad giving such a terrible tasting product to a family in need. TL;DR Terrible
"It used to be great. My older son went through a truckload of these before they changed the formulation, added sugar and basically made it to be junk food. Whole foods has recently introduced a product that reminds me of old purely o's. Not quite the same but close. TL;DR destroyed a great product"
"the tea itself is nothing wrong, but the leaf to make this tea is very low quality....you will know when you try TL;DR ok tea"
"I didn't know that cookies could taste so bad. This is far better than the lemon shortbread and the chocolate chip, but it isn't saying much. I truly regret purchasing so many boxes for my job and will NEVER EVER trust my coworker for recommending them. TL;DR Horrible, I prefer never to eat cookies again than have one of these"
"I am in love with the cheddar cheese fries.  They remind me of a long forgotten snack food of the 1980's, a spicy crunchy bag of fries, only without the spicy.  As other reviewers have said, ""YUMMY!"" TL;DR Addicting"
Ingredient list shows good quality. I purchased the venison because I was advised by a friend it was good for weight loss. I have one dog who has been on many different diets without any success at losing any weight. He's been fed this venison canned food for less than a month and I'm already seeing some weight loss. I think it's working. TL;DR So far it's working for the purpose I ordered it
"I love this stuff. Sometimes I mix it with cooked quinoa, soy milk, and cinnamon, stick it in the nuker, and have a yummy breakfast treat. You can also have it by itself, hot or cold. It's healthy and it tastes good, what more could you ask for. TL;DR More good stuff from Bob's Red Mill"
"Salty, malty and tasty. Not for sissies. A little goes a long way and is a tasteful departure from jam or marmalade. About a jar-a-year should do for a party of two. TL;DR Great stuff!"
My kids and I loved this cookie!! It was so tasty and best of all it was good for them too! I highly recommend this product! It was very soft and fresh too! TL;DR Yummy and kids loved it too!
"I drink tea all day every day, and I'm constantly trying new ones. This is a lovely addition to my stash and the can keeps it fresh and fragrant. TL;DR Nice change of pace"
"I was very surprised to see that there are negative reviews for this drink.  My husband and I were both pleasantly surprised by how amazing this soda is!  As far as orange sodas go, I don't see how you can do much better.  We definitely didn't notice any kind of weird aftertaste.  Also the price on here (don't forget the shipping) is ridiculous.  See if your local Walmart stocks this, because ours does and it was only about 5 bucks. TL;DR Fantastic Drink"
This liquid stevia has no after taste and blends easily when making smoothies and other drinks. It's also great in oatmeal. TL;DR Love NuNaturals liquid stevia!
"I liked the taste of the caramel flavored energy chews, but I did not notice any significant energy improvement. I'm a candy eater and I found myself wanting to eat them all at one time (greedy, I know), but I didn't.  Maybe if I had, I would have gotten that jolt I was looking for.  Overall, the taste is good, but there was no noticeable change in energy. TL;DR Good Taste"
"I bought this at a reduced price because I have always wanted to make sushi the right way yet never got around to getting a kit. Everything is included in this (except the main ingredients of course) and it is easy to get started. Although the book may be hard to follow in some places, it is overall a good guide. The included ingredients (rice, soy sauce, ginger, etc.) are all top quality though I would have preferred something a bit more natural. When these run out I will try looking elsewhere for the same quality but maybe also organic. A really great gift for someone who loves sushi but hasn't made any themselves. TL;DR Nice way to get introduced to the art of sushi making"
"Came before estimated delivery.  Love this taste! It reminds me of when miracle whip had a spicy version, which I really missed since you can't get it anymore.  This is a keeper! TL;DR Great!"
"The pecan pie bars are delicious. In texture and taste they are exactly like classic pecan pie filling. These things are so good I wrote the company fan mail. Hopefully they will not respond with a restraining order, I was pretty effusive. If you like pecan pie you should be pretty impressed by these bars. TL;DR If I'm going to be executed, I want these for dessert at my last meal"
"I have no idea why this product is packaged this way.  The first thing I did, was to cut the packages open and pour the contents into a small jar to keep and use from.  This butterred flavored coconut oil makes great popcorn.  I use it with pop secret popcorn in a presto microwave popcorn popper and it makes large puffy popcorn that looks and tastes great.  You only need 1 table spoon per batch so this will last a long time. TL;DR Great Product"
"As a new dad I was excited to announce the birth of my first born child. To commemorate the event I wished to offer friends and family a traditional cigar. Since I'm not a smoker and few people that I know are smokers I opted for a more politically correct option of bubble gum cigars. I defy anyone to find these anywhere but Amazon or other select online retailers. These are just hard to find, period.<br /><br />When they arrived I was pleased to see that the products matched the listing.<br /><br />Here's a detailed breakdown of these bubble gum cigars:<br /><br />Shipping - Fast!<br />Appearance - Great retro packaging. This package is reminiscent of 1940's-1950's artwork. Great look. The bubble gum cigars had flat sides, perhaps from sitting on a shelf for a while? Each of the cigars was labeled and individually wrapped. Great for giving as gifts.<br />Taste - Look, these cigars aren't going to please many palates. They are adequate to get the point across, but not very enjoyable to chew. The texture and taste are reminiscent of the gum that came in packs of cards back in the 1980s. I'm not sure if sports cards and novelty cards still come with those dry sticks of gum, but these taste to be of a similar recipe. Very Bazooka Joe like, however less flavorful and the flavor it does have is lost very quickly. That said, they aren't made to win taste awards, they are a simple gift for a new dad to express his pride.<br /><br />So, overall these cigars are a great way to commemorate a wonderful life event without being un-PC. I would buy these again if the need arises. I do recommend these to all new dads as a fun handout to friends, family and co-workers. TL;DR A Must for New Parents"
"I received this tea as a gift, it came in a box of ten, assorted flavors. So far I tried the mango peach and sencha and these are both terrific, a light clear taste, not heavy. Highly recommend, despite the cost. I will probably be ordering more as a gift or for myself. TL;DR Wonderful, just wonderful"
"I thought this coffee was really good, but I think the next time I order, I will order something a bit stronger. TL;DR timothy's"
it's cereal and it's good ... my friend is afraid of buying cereal online because he thinks it'll be stale - let me assure you that i've never had a problem with staleness.  cereal is always delivered quickly and is fresh. TL;DR it's cereal and it's good
I really enjoy my Stash Preium Earl Grey Tea and Orange Spice Black Tea. I'm so glad that I was able to order it direct because you can't find the Orange Spice Black Tea in the grocery stores locally. TL;DR Stash Premium Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea
"There's not a whole lot you can say about graham crackers. They're exactly what you expect, the same old slightly-sweet, crunchy crackers that we remember from when we were kids. As snacks go, they're reasonably healthy, although I generally prefer to buy the low-fat variety. Yes, they have sugar in them, but they also have dietary fiber, so at least you're getting some good stuff along with it. My kids eat these several times a week and always enjoy them.<br /><br />The idea behind the packaging of this particular variety is interesting: the crackers are packaged in smaller quantities, six squares per package. (Each square consists of two rectangular halves.) In theory, this is a nice idea, allowing you to grab a pack and bring them on the road or wherever else you're going. The problem is, six crackers is really too many for this purpose. If they were packaged in quantities of four, for example, I would find them a lot more useful. TL;DR Good graham crackers -- the kids like 'em"
"Advertisement for tea says it is strong and flavorful.  The taste must be quite subtle.  The tea, when steeping, presents with a deep reddish brown color.  The aroma is quite mild.  I brew an 8 cup pot; with one heaping tbsp. At 4 minutes the flavor is to mild.  This is brewing as reccommended.  To get an adequate taste I brew 6 cups with 2 rounded tbsps. for 5 minutes.  This is the upper limit of their strength recommendations.  Well; what do I hsve?  At any level of brewing I either have a wimpy cup or one so bitter no pleasurable flavor could be discerned.  This is the first Davidson's tea that I have not liked.  I can not recommend it to anyone.  Purchased at Amazon.  Arrived quickly in good condition.  Surprisingly little dust and sweepings size particles. TL;DR Its a question of taste"
"I've just finished my first container of CLICK (mocha). I make mine in the blender every morning.  Blending ensures creamy texture and no undissolved globs.  I make mine with half water and half skim-milk.  It has replaced morning coffee for me.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a tasty, easy, and fast way to get some protein and caffeine at the same time.  Please try from a blender if you've had bad luck with getting drinks like this to have the right texture.  I'm awaiting my second container from Amazon.<br />As a side note: I have mixed it in part with Slim-Fast powder as a way to increase the vitamins and nutritional value when I felt I needed more calories. Keep an eye on the carbs, though.<br />This is a great product I plan to continue using. TL;DR Excellent product (a little tweaking makes it better)."
"Energy gum? What kind of sick stuff is that?<br /><br />Wonderfully sick stuff!<br /><br />If you're such an java fiend that you can't get at your morning coffe fast enough, Jolt Gum cuts out all that time-wasting brewing and stirring and gets you right to the jolt you need. If you need caffeine to wake up enough to make the coffee, it's the perfect solution. It tastes just like normal spearmint gum, but it isn't so be careful. TL;DR Bodacious!"
I have been using this in icecream and the tase is great and has no funny after taste or alchol tast that extracts and vanilla flavorings have. TL;DR Great tast and fast service
This is a great product for the fans of the soda.  Almost smells like Dr. Pepper and has a great taste.  Great for Dr. Pepper and BBQ enthusiasts. TL;DR Great Dr.Pepper Product
"This is certainly an interesting tea.  It does not have a light flavor, like green or white tea.  Personally, I taste notes of green olives (yes, green olives) in this tea, which I don't care for.  But that taste is only subtle. TL;DR Interesting"
"This stuff tastes amazing...  I used it during the Master Cleanse & it's the perfect amount for the 10 day time frame.  If you plan to go longer, I suggest getting more than 32 ounces.  I feel bad for anyone using the grocery store bought stuff on their pancakes and waffles - there is just no comparison! TL;DR Great taste & great for use in the Master Cleanse"
"We like as bold a coffee we can get without it being bitter. This is the one! It is bolder than Dark magic, the one we were drinking. TL;DR For Real Coffee Lovers"
"I have ordered this exact item from Amazon a few times before. It is basically two 12 packs in one box. One of the 12 packs was already opened and was missing four of the mini bottles. This is the first time I have had this happen. It's not worth sending back, but it's extremely annoying.<br /><br />I will say that the product is great otherwise. It's virtually identical to 5 hour energy, but it costs half as much. The berry flavor isn't great, but it's not terrible either. TL;DR Already opened, items missing"
"The product has a good strong ginger flavor and is sweet; it is, however, not syrup. Sweet ginger water would be a more accurate description. TL;DR Not Syrup"
"The previous review, faulting the Campofrio lomo because of its hardness, is accurate, and I was at first equally disappointed. But I hit on the idea of microwaving a slice, much as one might microwave stale bread to soften it. This works! I microwave a slice (a little tough to cut, but I use a sharp knife and keep my fingers safe) on high heat for about seven seconds. It softens, becomes easily chewed, and the flavor comes out fully. I've become addicted! TL;DR Yes, but try this"
This is my first ever review of anything from amazon. I am so very pleasantly surprised at this snack. I just just got my package and immediately opened one. MY WORD! I LOOOOOOOVE IT! i live in Trinidad (caribbean) and these are not carried in my local grocery. It's a little expensive yes but soooo very worth it! Fighting all my will-power not to dive into another.... LOL... TL;DR amazingly good!
"I've been drinking Vita Coco on and off for the last year or so. Tropical Fruit lives up to the name, as it reminds me of a guava flavor. If you're looking for something exotic with the familiar coconut water smoothness, go for this flavor! TL;DR Smooth flavor, tastes like Guava!"
"I have been eating Hemp Seed Hearts for breakfast since Aug. 15, 2011. I love them!! I've lost 15 pounds because my appetite is significantly reduced and my energy level is great. I eat a big salad in the morning with 2oz. Hemp Seeds, with plain yogurt and Mrs. Dash spices. Since August, I've not had a salad in the AM about 6 times. After a weekend of eating like a 'normal person', I can't wait until I can go back to eating my salad for breakfast. My acid reflux is GONE, I'm no longer bloated and gassy. Hemp Seeds are full of nutrition and I plan to eat them for the rest of my life (I'm 52). TL;DR toreyp123"
GREAT BIODEGRADABLE BAGS FOR GATHERING YOUR COMPOST.  I HAVE NOT TRIED THEM FOR FOOD STORAGE. TL;DR COMPOST BAGS
"This is an excellent product for those who wish to protect their plants from fungus diseases.  I use it on my roses and other flowers and it stops disease, even fungus disease.  Highly recommend this product. TL;DR Ortho Rose Pride"
"What is more thoughtful or caring than the gift of spotted dick? C'mon, even a sour puss can't keep a straight face when a case of this stuff shows up at their door! (For the record as far as tinned spotted dick goes, Hienz is by far the best!) TL;DR Best tasting gag gift ever!!!!"
"Needed something that refreshed that was NOT a soda and that was low in calories that tastes good to get through the midwest heat wave this summer.<br /><br />This pretty much took care of the issue, and could easily be diluted by 1/2 the amount of mix to the std. amount of H2O and that was great as I got virtually 2 for the price of one deal here!<br /><br />Of course, NOTHING tastes like the real thing when it comes to good old fashioned lemonade....but this was the lesser of the brand evils. TL;DR Arizona SUGAR FREE Lemonade"
"I didn't like the idea of overpaying some of the snooty special foods stores for what should be a reasonably priced product.  So I went wholesale / bulk with 5 pounds!  Admittedly, it's a wee bit too much .. time to divy up for friends and family!  Great for households that cook Indian food regularly. TL;DR A lot of powder!"
"This is the best candy ever!!!! Certain Walgreens used to sell it but it was hard to find.  One day I was online and was happy to see that I could buy this product in bulk.  Also, the price is GREAT!!!! Will purchase again!!!! TL;DR Candy at its BEST!!!!"
I put this one under my Cuisinart Single Serve and it works great.  It keeps everything organized and at close reach.  I am able to get rid of several boxes of K-cups with this single item.  I think it would be possible to stack multiples together as well.  Very sturdy. TL;DR Great for under Coffee maker
"My 4 year old likes this cereal, and I like giving it to him because it isn't garbage like frosted flakes, etc.<br /><br />This cereal has a sweet taste without being too sweet.  I don't think it has a noticeable ""nut"" taste to it like you might think.  Definitely stays crisp in milk as others have indicated.<br /><br />Serving size is .75 cups, 100 calories (less than Special K), 1g fat, 23g carbs (10g sugars), 2g dietary fiber, 2g protein.<br /><br />No partially hydro oils, No high fructose corn syrup! TL;DR This Cereal Gets the 4-year Old Seal of Approval..."
My dog loves to chew!  I figured a product created specifically for dogs that love to chew would be perfect.  Rocky actually ATE this bone.  And then proceeded to throw up pieces of nylabone the next morning.  Horrible!  If your dog is an agressive chewer do NOT purchase this product. TL;DR Not for a really agressive chewer
"i have been enjoying genova tuna for more than 40 years! as stores cut back on stock they have chosen to eliminate the small can ( perfect for lunch )of this tuna and only sell the large one.in searching for the small can i found it at a great price and available in a 24 count box at amazon.com .the service was fast and the shipping rate was hard to beat. without a doubt i will be purchasing another case of this great tuna ,from amazon .com TL;DR wonderfull tuna great price"
"Looking for a way to spice up your drinking water and getting tired of adding lemons or limes?  Lipton's Tea & Honey mix adds a flavorful new option already divided into individual serving packets, which makes it easy to add to a water bottle on the go or a full glass of water at home.<br /><br />This particular flavor is quite different from the standard powdered mixed drinks, having a strong honey taste with a light strawberry twist.  There isn't much sugar in it either, at only 2 grams per packet, so it's an option to consider for diabetics or people watching their sugar intake.<br /><br />Plenty of other reviewers have noted there is a small amount of sucralose (Splenda) in here, which is something to consider if you don't care for artificial sweeteners. As the husband of someone with Type 1 diabetes I've gotten quite used to it and find it to be a very enjoyable flavor, so it didn't personally bother me at all.<br /><br />If you don't have time to brew up iced tea at home and want a quick flavor boost for water, this is a great option, and is an excellent way to make bottled water more exciting on picnics or car trips. TL;DR Great honey flavor for making bottled water more exciting"
I drink about 5 cups of coffee a day and I have tried several liquid sugars but none better than Kelly's Delight. Gave it a go about 3 months ago and I am sticking with it! TL;DR Best liquid sugar on the market.
"Arrived three days after order, bottom two leaves were a tad beat up, but the plant bounced back nicely after a few shots of Liquid Grow.<br /><br />Waited a week to transplant and it is now sprouting up its third set of new leaves in as many weeks and growing nicely.<br /><br />Pretty plant, for sure keep it out of direct outdoor sunlight.  I keep mine inside where it receives indirect light and it seems happy as a clam at high tide.  It can take daily (yes daily) shots of liquid fertilizer.<br /><br />Another great buy from Amazon for me. TL;DR Good Product, Good Value"
"Oysters came quickly (to Kansas) and very well packed. I ate several raw and did notice a little more silt than I would like but overall not bad. There were upwards of 50 nice size oysters with only 2 dead ones when we cooked them 2 days later. Free super saving shipping was unbeatable. Next time I'm ready to relive my childhood of living in florida and having oysters cooked over an open flame, this is my place! TL;DR Just like when I was a kid"
"Very disappointing- I usually LOVE coconut haystacks, but these were waxy cheap tasting chocolate with not enough coconut to call themselves 'haystacks'. Yuck.  Save your money and just buy a Mounds bar... TL;DR Awful tasting!"
I was surprised to find only two fish in the can.  They were very tasty but very expensive for two fish after paying for shipping.  I wish Amazon would stock Seasons products. TL;DR Only two fish but very tasty
"Since I have used this product before I had no questions concerning the flavor or the maker... I do not drive and have trouble getting to store for needed items...Just out of curiosty I decides to check for availabled on line and was surprised that I was able to locate it with no problem.  Was also very pleased how quickly I rceived it.... I will be ordering it again through the same site in the future....<br />  Thank You ,<br />  C.Long TL;DR very pleased"
"I wanted to switch to a higher quality food for my dog, a 2.5 year old german shep mix.  She had stomach digestion issues as a pup, and although she is past that she still tended on having loose stool quite often.  Consistency varied often, as did her regularity.<br /><br />I mixed with her old food (Hills Science Diet) and she had no issues with digestion during the transition, which I did gradually over about 3 weeks until she finished her old food and was completely on the Hi Tek.  I have just started on our second bag of this and she's been fine, with much more regular, and solid stool.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />* She seems to like it!<br />* She appears to have better digestion and elimination<br /><br />Additional comments - not necessarily a con:<br />* Food pieces seem small for a mid-large dog.  It does not seem to bother her, and perhaps that too can help her digestion.  Just be cautioned that it is NOT the same size pellets or balls as the mid to large dog food that I had been used to.<br />* While it in no way affects the quality of the actual product, the packaging is very plain and very unremarkable so it does not catch your eye if you were buying in a store. TL;DR My Dog loves this stuff"
Some of the reviews warn about the strong smokey aroma. They could not describe how pungeant this is and it leaves a strong lasting after taste. I threw all the tea away since it is not eligible for return. FYI the other Twinings products are excellent. TL;DR Very strong unpleasant aftertaste
"It's hard to find crackers and other traditionally wheat products that are gluten free.  These crackers are a poor substitute.  They don't have a good taste- just starchy and, well, blah.  No amount of cheese or cracker topping can fix it.  I recommend Crunchmasters Multigrain GF crackers. They are the best that I have found. TL;DR Starchy Flavor and Mouth Feel"
"A really good cup of coffee........smooth-not bitter, almost (very very close) as good as Kona Peaberry, great flavor and aroma.  Try it, you'll like it! TL;DR Great cup of coffee"
"A nice, healthy sweet snack or quick breakfast.  They taste quite good.  I always keep some of these on hand. TL;DR Love them!"
"This French cookies is similar to the version of the shortbread cookies, except any French or European cookies is never too sweet or too rich tasting. this cookies is light, a taste of buttery and the sweetness are all perfect. I did order another one in large quantity. TL;DR Delicious cookies"
"ingredients: sugar,brown sugar,molasses,soy lecithin, salt, artificial flavors, fd&c yellow no. 5(e102) fd&c red 40(127), fd&c blue no. 1 (e133)<br />it makes a brown very slightly sweet popcorn.  its ok.  clean up is easy even if you burn the sugar. TL;DR its good on oatmeal"
"I am trying to eat a low carbohydrate diet.  Mix this with your liquid of choice, some ice and put it in the blender until thick.  It satisfies my cravings and tastes really good. TL;DR Craving chocolate?"
I found this tea a few years ago at a west coast natural foods show and loved it.  Since I cant find it here on the east coast I've been ordering at the Numi site.  I am so glad to find it on Amazon.  Love the vanilla flavor and smell.  I smell the bag before I brew it.  Very satisfying to the senses. TL;DR My favorite
"This food is such an improvement over the normal Science Diet wet food, as it comes in a gravy rather than one lump of food. It's much moister. My cat loves it! TL;DR Favorite!"
"In my attempt to duplicate the Cafe Cubano's my wife and I have in Miami, I bought this product after much research.<br /><br />Cannot get this where I live (Colorado) so had to order online.  This is the supreme standard of Cuban-style coffee beans.  Beans came in perfect condition and vacuum packed in the bag displayed.<br /><br />I have not tried Pilon, but these two brands come from the same company in Miami.  Pilon from what I gather is the more standard version, while the Bustelo Supreme is the higher line.<br /><br />Trick - be sure grind these very very fine, and add (lots of) sugar in the carafe where the espresso will pour into from the machine, this allows the sugar to carmelize and it tastes more authentic. TL;DR The best cuban coffee out there..."
"The flavor isn't bad. But I'd hoped the texture would also be like that of a ""normal"" cracker. Not so. It's like crunching down a thin, brittle piece of plastic shattering between your teeth. The Japanese perfected this unpleasant texture long ago. TL;DR Same old problem as with other rice-flour crackers"
"Chimes ginger is the best ginger candy I've ever tasted, that's why I bought it!  I had a sample of a ginger chew a month ago and I liked it so much I tracked down the company and found a distributor that sold it in larger quantities.  I bought a pound which is a good amount for me, the little bags don't hold enough.  This product is really fresh, it's made with real, natural ginger root, sounds shocking but it's true, and it tastes delicious.  You can tell it's fresh, raw ginger because it has the little 'zing' feeling that you get when eating raw ginger root, and it has a strong natural taste.  Raw ginger root is great for ulcers and digestion I've heard.  So this ginger candy is healthy and only one or two can satisfy my sweet tooth without providing so many calories.  I think it's a great find, a high quality, gourmet-style, well-priced candy and I plan to always have some on hand.<br /><br />Link:  [...] TL;DR Excellent ginger, excellent service"
"This is getting to be a hard product to find.  We use it in a small german restaurant located in SW NM.  It is a good product, high quality and we are delighted to find it on your web site.  The other sources we have used have dropped off the internet.  We hope you will continue to carry the product.  You price is the best we have found TL;DR German egg noodles"
These are a great low carb snack for those on Atkins. They provide the crunch that is usually missing from this diet (except for pork rinds). They also work well as a crouton substitute on a salad! TL;DR Great snack!
"I have had Douwe Egberts coffee for many years.  Mostly at resturants, which has a different proccess then the avarage home.  I have tried to find this coffee in many places & fortunitly Amazon.com was the only place I could, besides Aruba!  However, I'm not going to fly to Aruba to buy it when I need it, I will continure to order it from Amazon.com & highly recommend this coffee if you are a coffee lover like I am. TL;DR Great Coffee"
"Great product. I use it as stock for other dishes, but I also like to drink it as a tasty tea replacement after a workout in cold weather. TL;DR Great low-sodium soup"
This is the most delicious coffee we have ever had! You can drink it hot with just or cold. When you drink it cold with a litle cream - who needs booze? TL;DR As Good As It Gets!
I can no longer find the Hazelnut flavor in the local stores anymore.<br />So now I buy all my coffee through Amazon.com.  It is a great coffee and a great way to buy it. TL;DR Nescafe
"We try a lot of different coffees, but this one has been, by far, one of the very best!  It is full bodied, yet smooth with no harshness at all.  Youcould call it a true Liquid Comfort Food! TL;DR Outstanding smooth coffee"
My dog just LOVES these bones.  They arrived in great shape and last a long time  The only downside is that they don't smell the greatest. TL;DR Great and long-lasting!
"After searching several supermarkets for this product, I started to give up. My Daughter suggested I check the internet to see who carried this product, so I did just that.....Low and Behold Amazon had it and for a reasonable price.... I'm almost out of it... Time to place another order, it's simply delicious...""Land o Lakes"" Great Job..... TL;DR Delicious Cocoa"
"It is hard to find red pistachio nuts, but it is a Christmas tradition to have them - so, I had to resort to ordering online.  The nuts were perfectly fine.  The only issue I had was that while the nuts were $10.50, the shipping was $9.95.  I didn't realize it until after, as I had multiple items in my order from multiple vendors.  My fault for not paying attention - but, to basically charge as much for shipping as you do the product - a very small item - is ridiculous. TL;DR Red Pistachio Nuts"
"These cherries are awesome, my whole family loves them. We lived in Germany for 3 years and to find a place state side to order these from is great we order alot of them beucase they sure go fast. TL;DR Yummy Yummy"
"As far as taste goes, this is the best coconut water I've tasted. I have not tried all the other brands, so I am only comparing this to coconut water ordered at restaurants (which I think is usually sweetened, so it really isn't a fair comparison), Vitacoco, and Amy and Brian's. Vitacoco uses Brazilian coconuts while Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's use Thai coconuts. It seems like Taste Nirvana and Amy and Brian's are naturally sweeter than Vitacoco, with Taste Nirvana being the sweetest. This is a good sweet though, since all of these three brands have no sugars added. While I've liked all the coconut water I've tasted, Vitacoco can have a slightly more salty and less sweet taste, while Taste Nirvana has an amazing taste with just the right amount of sweetness. I liked the pulp as well, although some of the pieces seem to be from more mature coconuts rather than the young almost gelatin pulps I'm used to at some restaurants.<br /><br />The only reason I took a star off is due to the price. These 9.5 oz bottles are not the most economical way to buy Taste Nirvana. In fact, at the current price this costs as much as I paid at the coffee shop for individual bottles. For the best bargain on this brand, buy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OW342G"">Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp, 16.2-Ounce (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I wanted to try this brand because a lot of people say Taste Nirvana or Amy and Brian's taste the best, and I'd have to give my vote to Taste Nirvana. Hopefully some day I will taste a fresh coconut and maybe that will get my vote, but if you're like me and don't have any coconut trees nearby, try this out. Enjoy! TL;DR Best tasting coconut water I've tasted, a little pricey in these bottles"
I ordered these on a Subscribe and Save special because I liked the high protein content and most of the reviews had a positive message about the taste.  I am generally a fan of Peanut Butter flavored things but not these.  They remind me of old school powerbar taste and texture.  The taste is not very peanut butter.  The texture is pretty dry and grainy too.  You will definitely want to drink a full glass of liquid with these.  They are also very dense and heavy.<br /><br />Part of the reason why I might not be happy with mine is it looks like the bars got hot at some time.  The chocolate on the outside is melted to the package pretty badly.  I ordered mine and they sat on my doorstep for a few hours in 95+ heat. I dont really blame this on Amazon its just what happens when ordering online. TL;DR Not a great taste but good for you
"We have a 9-year old lab mix and a 1 year old shepard mix.  We tried this food because we were told it would do well for both of the dogs.  They both eat it right up.  It's small bits which is good for the older dog.  Their coats look good.  The food is pricey, but it seems like it is good stuff.  Wish they would sell the 30# bag on amazon. TL;DR Nice coat less shedding"
"When it comes to adding a little kick of heat to some wings, or seafood, pizza or even a burger I turn to a brand of hot sauce that has not let me down in over 20 years of using it. TABASCO. What makes me stick to TABASCO pepper sauce, for some added heat, is how it adds the heat. This hot sauce does not come across overpowering which will destroy the natural flavor of the food. Instead it adds a sweet ""kick"" to your food, giving it added flavor while spicing it up a few notches.<br /><br />This product contains Distilled Vinegar, Red Pepper and Salt. It is a very simple product that is all natural. TABASCO ""Ages"" their Hot Sauces in wooden barrels like one might age a wine. They re-use the barrels after a batch is done so with each batch the flavor continues to stay bold and get better and better.<br /><br />Is TABASCO for everyone? Probably not as it does have some nice kick to it. However if you are a fan of spicing up the food in your life there is no better brand to have sitting around the house. It works for almost every food product out there and I personally would say it has about a ""MEDIUM"" heat to it(2500-5000 Scoville units). 5 stars for a product that has stood the test of time for over 150 years<br /><br />**NOTE: If you are looking for a more ""MILD"" spice you should try the Green Pepper sauce. A nice sweet green pepper flavor with very little kick (600-1200 Scoville units)<br /><br />**NOTE: If you want a more smokey flavor with your spice, try the Chipotle pepper sauce. It goes great with BBQ or meats with a soft kick. ""MILD-MEDIUM"" heat (1500-2500 Scoville units) TL;DR An all natural hot sauce that compliments not overpowers.."
"Great to warm up with, not to salty, good when you have a cold, flu, etc. Just broth and noodles, whats not to like here?  Easy to take with you and to store. TL;DR excellent product"
"This chocolate is amazing..I love the taste and smell, this is the only chocolate for me...I found a new love! TL;DR WOW....."
"I liked the beans. They were vacuum sealed, plump and moist. Would recommend them for any use. I personally split and stuck them in some vodka to make vanilla extract. Yum! TL;DR Good Buy"
"I purchased this item several times.  My dog is a great dane/pit bull mix and he loves his rope toy.  It lasts about 6 months or more depending on how much he chews on it.  And this is a dog that can chew the black kong to pieces in about a month or two.  This rope seems to be the longest lasting dog toy I've ever bought for my pup.<br /><br />The only thing is you get a random color, but I don't think my dog cares.  I would recommend this for any owner of large dogs or hard chewers.  It also cleans their teeth.  And seems to be cheaper here than other places I've looked. TL;DR Great for Large Dogs"
"I love this breakfast cookie! I usually have this with fruit and tea or juice for a quick breakfast, or sometimes I have it with vanilla ice cream for dessert. TL;DR BREAKFAST ON THE GO"
"Why only three stars? Because I have a hideous sweet tooth that this product just didn't satisfy. It's not the tea's fault that I needed to add two tablespoons of honey to it to make it palatable. That's my stupid sweet tooth!<br /><br />The smell was lovely--I think I might need to find a candle in this scent. And, despite my drowning the tea's more subtle flavors in honey, I still caught a hint of both blackberry and vanilla. With no caffeine, this tea is a fabulous way to relax before bed and made the perfect companion to my most excellent reading material and a cozy fire. TL;DR Subtle flavor, great smell"
"I agree with some reviewers that this is bland and tasteless, but I'd go as far as to say it tastes weird. I'm a huge fan of miso, and this didn't have any miso taste to it. My cup also had 2 tiny pieces of seaweed, 1 TINY mushy piece of what I'm guessing was supposed to be tofu, and no mushrooms.<br /><br />I also read the nutrition facts and it had a LOT of sodium, which is shocking since it tasted so bland. Moreover, it said 1 of these 1.9 ounce cups is 2 servings. That's preposterous. How could 1 oz. of anything (even with the addition of bland broth) count as a serving? I think they only made it into 2 servings because otherwise, 1 of these cups would probably be 50+% of your daily sodium allowance? I threw my cup away, so I can't check it, but believe me, it had a shocking amount of sodium for gross, bland noodles. TL;DR Tastes awful AND is high in sodium"
"I purchased this tea because ginger is supposed to help with muscle aches and pains as well rheumatoid arthritis.  I've only had two cups so it's a little early to tell if there will be significant improvment but so far I can tell my neck muscles move with less pain.  For my first cup I poured the whole packet of crystals into my cup.  As a lifelong coffee drinker, one packet was way to much.  I could feel the peppery taste on roof of my mouth and throat.  There seems to be approx 2 TAB of crystals in each packet.  For my next cup I measured out 1 TAB and it was just perfect.  I really like the taste of this tea.  The blend of ginger and honey seems to be just right.  For avid tea drinkers, this is an excellent choice and for avid coffee drinkers, I would also recommend  this tea. TL;DR Ginger Tea"
"In my opinion, this actually tastes better than an actual cup of Starbucks coffee.  A real cup of Starbucks will taste burnt but Via does not.  Also, and perhaps most important to me, I can get the temperature of the water to the exact temperature I like before mixing in the Via.  No need to wait for it to cool down.<br /><br />The Amazon price (60 cents/packet when I bought) really makes it worth buying for the convenience alone.  Some people have suggested that this bargain-priced Via is somehow inferior to the one you buy in a Starbucks, e.g. expiration date is sooner, but it looks, smells, and tastes the same as the store-bought.  The expiration date was 10 months ahead, if that's a concern. TL;DR Better than an actual cup of Starbucks"
"Like the product, better than the canister (canister isn't sugar free) and the ease of the individual packs.  But shipping to Hawaii is not allowed by Amazon because it's a grocery item.  I don't understand what the difference is.  It's a sealed package, not prepared foods. TL;DR Good item, shipping is a hassle"
This tea has a bitter taste that I didn't like.  I am fond of the Gloria Jeans chai tea that Amazon has been out of for a LONG time and will wait for that before trying anything else TL;DR Chai tea
I heard all about this coffee and I thought I would give it a try being I love Blueberry....Well Let me tell you I Love it and I have my Husband turned on to it too...I mean I don't drink it everyday<br />I rotate between different ones but this is one of my Favorites....it is really Good Coffee for something different... TL;DR Love the Taste!!!
"..THEY'RE NOT AS GOOD AS THE CHOCOLATY PRETZELS FLAVOR. THEY ALSO HAVE A DISTINCT DIET CANDY TASTE THING GOING ON. NOT HORRIBLE BUT LIKE THE OTHER FLAVOR, NOT SATISFYING ENOUGH, SO U END UP EATING 2 + THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE WHOLE PREMISE OF ONLY 90CALS A BAR. FIBER PLUS BARS STILL NO.1 WITH ME. TL;DR OK FOR A CHANGE OF PACE BUT.."
"I was hopeful that this would be a great robust dark french roast coffee. The individual packaging seemed great and the pods are plump with coffee grounds. But the product of the coffee is well, little more than hot water in flavor. I will try again this afternoon using two pods but I have little hope for getting a robust flavor out of this product. I will be searching for another brand, not sure I will even go through all that I have order here. TL;DR Little to no flavor"
This product is my dog's absolute favorite when it comes to dog treats. I find them perfect for training... and so does she! TL;DR Zukes Peanut Butter Mini Treats
"I eat this on everything that isn't sweet in taste. chips, burgers, salads, mexican food, chinese food, bread, sandwiches and my tongue:) this is an outstanding Hot sauce. It's not too hot but it tastes fantastic! it's easy for me to pour this and completely cover your food in it and that's what I do.<br /><br />I don't know what else to say other than it's well worth a try if you haven't tried it already and at a cheap price, about $1.59 at the grocery store for this size, it's about 59 cents for the smaller I think.<br /><br />bottom line, my favorite and the best I have tasted that won't catch my head on fire:) TL;DR My very favorite!"
"I've tried several brands of coffee pods in my single serving, Hamilton Beach coffee maker. The Aloha Island French Vanilla and the couple other's I've used are, although costing more per pod than others, probably the best in flavor. TL;DR onewiz"
When I visited South Africa I became acquainted with Bisto products.  I have used them ever since when I can get them!  They sure are helpful in 'sprucing up' recipes.  Recommend these sauces. TL;DR Bisto Chip Shop Curry Sauce Granules
My cavalier king charles spaniel and a friend's beagle can't survive without greenies!!!  Fantastic product and great seller... TL;DR Can't live without greenies
I love this product!. It makes cooking chicken so easy and you don't have to watch it: 45 minutes in the oven and you're done!!. Experiment with added ingredients. TL;DR ShakeNBake
Wonderful espresso roast coffee.  I like the 3 packages so you don't open it all at once and the coffee looses its freshness too quickly.  Reasonably priced and ethically grown. TL;DR great full-bodied coffee
"1 pound ground turkey; 1 pound ground pork; 8 ounces currants; 3 tablespoons chopped cilantro; into small meatballs, broiled 6 minutes...kisses and hugs! TL;DR The Real Secret!"
So I am very pleased with these pods. They taste super fresh and produce good crema. Smell like fresh ground.<br /><br />Good job! TL;DR Best ESE Pods I have tried
"I buy Farmer's Market organic pumpkin to mix in with my dog's meals.  I've seen the comments about dented cans and have to say that I think it's the manufacturer.  When I buy in the store I always have to sift through the cans to find the least damaged.  The metal seems to be pretty thin.  My Amazon order was in much better shape than the cans I've seen in the stores.  Price is good too.  Locally, I've seen this product priced between $2.39 and $3.69 a can.  And even though the Amazon price is only pennies less a can than my lowest local price, it's incredibly convenient; especially with the free shipping. TL;DR Excellent value"
"It is very hard to tempt my dog with dry food, and this product proved NOT to be the exception. An almost life-long eater of moist food, my 10 year old Doxie - mix will eat a few bites if it is included with her canned food. Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food did prove to be a hit with cats, but not as much as did the Beneful Dry that we tried earlier this summer. The number one ingredient in this product is beef, while corn gluten, which seems to be a hot button issue for many, comes in seventh. All pet food sold in the United States meets the minimum nutritional standards for dogs and cats. Now, one can decide that just meeting the minimum is not acceptable and choose to purchase a more expensive brand from a vet or a speciality store, but for some price is a consideration as well. If my dog liked this brand I would buy it, but she seems determined to keep me purchasing wet food for her. TL;DR So-So Food for Dogs"
"I normally grab this item at the local pet store and my cats (and carpets) absolutely love it.<br /><br />A couple months ago, I purchased a couple boxces from Amazon to fill out a shopping cart. Bad move. Not only did neither box grow a single blade of grass, but one of them spoiled and smelled horrible for a day or so.<br /><br />Amazon's excellent customer service jumped in and sent two more boxes last week for no charge. When I saw the dates on the box were different, I was relieved and expected to have grass growing any day. I was wrong. Something is not right with Amazon's supply. Not a single blade of grass from four boxes now.<br /><br />Spend the extra couple of bucks and pick this stuff up locally. You cats (and dogs) will thank you. TL;DR No Grass for My Cats"
yesssssss. your hands will get oilyyyyyy<br /><br />  you need to<br /><br />  open w scissors (lest oil burst gets you)<br />  use chopsticks to reach into opened package to pull out your container of seaweed<br />  voila! where is the yellow oil w the strong smell coming from? it's cause the container for the seaweed is broken!!! each and every single one!!!<br />  now how to take seaweed out from container without getting your hands on yellow oil?<br /><br />  if that's how you like to eat then order. if not buy somewhere else<br /><br />  anyone has been able to get refund from amazon?<br /><br />  negative stars TL;DR yellow oil leaks out of every single package
"I have eaten Big Franks for years. They are lower in fat and more digestable than beef weiners.  The flavor is pleasant, the texture is very meat-like.  They are precooked so they can be warmed in the mocrowave for about 2 minutes for four franks.  They are very versatile and can be carried without refrigerated if they have not been opened.  Soy is the major ingredient and it is the only plant protien which is a complete protein by itself.  Patricia Neely-Mississippi TL;DR Big Franks"
Love this tea and drink it daily. It is a great tea with a great taste. It sooths the stomach and aids digestion. TL;DR Egyptian Licorice Mint Tea
"I have longish hair (to between my shoulderblades) that's curly and tends to frizz in the damp climate where I live.  Lately it's been kinda blah and dull, so I was excited to try this new conditioner.<br /><br />After using it for two weeks, I've noticed that my hair feels pretty nice.  It's soft and shinier than it has been, and it's super easy to get a comb through my hair after a shower.  It also does feel stronger than before, which is awesome.  My hair has this bad habit of getting delicate after I've colored it (and I color every two months or so; I'm too young for greys), so it's nice to have my hair feel stronger and more elastic than it has been.  I haven't noticed an appreciable difference in how much I'm shedding from the scalp, though, but that might be hoping for too much from a conditioner.<br /><br />Overall, it's a nice conditioner with a great scent. TL;DR Leaves my hair feeling nice AND less breakage"
"I have tried the Cola, Black Cherry, and Root Beer, and in fact order all of them regularly.  These are great.  To be honest, my first can of cola, I didn't like but then tried it another day and ever since, I really like them all.  My favs are the Root Beer and Black Cherry. TL;DR Love it - Soo much better than other diet sodas!"
"This cookie is the cure for the sweet tooth.  I am one of those people that usually has trouble just eating a few cookies, but I easily stop at just 3 (or 4).  I think there is something about the dark chocolate that is more satisfying.  The vanilla and green tea one's are another case.  Don't buy those if you have trouble with portion control. TL;DR Best cookie for diet control!!"
ProFlowers offered to send a replacement bouquet to make amends for a mistake on my first order.  I took them up on their offer and they came through with flying colors.  I will give them my business again. TL;DR Proflowers made good on their offer of restitution
"I think Nabisco has a different definition of ""gooey"" than I do. These aren't what I'd call gooey. They're moist(ish) and they have some semi-solid filling with the consistency of marzipan, but they're not gooey.<br /><br />They are delicious, though. Quite so. Chocolate is one of my favorite things in the universe, and while these aren't gourmet chocolate, they are decent American chocolate. If you enjoy devil's food, you'll like these.<br /><br />My only complaint is that these cookies seem to have fewer in the package than the non-gooey variety. Whether or not the filling is worth giving up a few cookies is up to you. TL;DR Yummy, not ""gooey"", but good."
"These mints are almost impossible to find in stores in our area so it is a treat to find them on line. Several sources had them, but this was a great price and the service was excellent. TL;DR Great service, great price! Thanks"
"You cannot ask for a better product to feed your little one.  It tastes great (just try it), it is clean, and has 100% of Vitamin A for the day.  My little guy eats at least three ""nozzle"" foods daily and they are so convenient, I can stash them anywhere and not worry about them getting crushed or going bad.  We get the HappyTot ones because of the Salba grains added and the omega-3s in that.  They are wonderful.  Buy many and your baby will be a HappyBaby or HappyTot. TL;DR Amazing taste, great packaging, wish everyone made such wonderful things for moms!"
"Why get 5# when you can get 10#? I love these smaller increments of nuts and seeds. 25 or 50 pounds always seems like a lot, though these days with teaching raw classes and all, it probably makes sense... Remember to freeze the nuts and seeds! Helps keeps them fresh. TL;DR More delicious raw walnuts!"
Our allergy prone pit is most consistent on this food.  We have tried everything and for whatever reason this just sits well.  No over the counter food is perfectly allergy contained but for a main stream brand they are reliable and consistent. TL;DR One of the best over the counter limited diets
"We bought this recently and was disappointed because Earth's best in general is a good at giving variety in their bulk packs. The main point for us purchasing jarred foods is for variety. Yet, 9 out of the 12 jars in the pack has banana. I'm not sure how that can be considered a variety.  I would not buy this again. Mainly because bananas are cheap and easy to feed your toddler. Why would you want to be gouged for the mark up?<br /><br />Also, I don't see how they can label them stage 2 when they have the consistency of stage 1 food. TL;DR Not really a variety pack"
"The 240ct tub of Cry Babies arrived quickly, in good condition, and fresh. They even taste good...for about 10 seconds. The flavor leaves much to be desired in both intensity and longevity. It's kinda sour, just enough sour to taste good, for literally 5-10 seconds and that's it. meh TL;DR Good, but not nearly sour enough"
4 stars because i feel it is lacking 'substance'. It feels a bit like eating hard raspberry jam. It is still a tasty treat but the black liquorice from RJs is far superior in my opinion. TL;DR Almost perfect but not quite
"I love to use these in yogurt or trail mixes! The two zipper-resealable bags help them last longer, and make getting these out for snacks convenient. TL;DR Yummy snack"
"After having tried the ginger sesame rice noodle bowl, I figured I'd branch out and pick up the hot and sour. Actually, I have it sitting right next to me as I type this.<br /><br />It is disgusting. It certainly doesn't taste hot due to the fact that the sourness is overwhelming. I really tried not to give this 1 star, but it's that bad. I love sour stuff but this, as the title says, just tastes like someone puked in it. TL;DR Tastes like vomit"
"These fruit gems are Sunkist!  That alone is a recommendation.  All my family loves these candies, but it's the favorite of my one son who doesn't eat candy! TL;DR #One candy choice"
"I usually purchase Similac Go & Grow, however, since amazon.com doesn't carry that item I decided to try Gerber Good Start 2. This product is for Toddler's ages 9months - 24 months.  My toddler drank this down just as well as the typical brand that we provide to him (similac).  This brand is also less expensive than similac.  I wish that amazon.com carried similac or offered this on subscribe and save.  Maybe they will in the future.<br />My toddler will not drink milk so this is a GREAT option if your child wants formula over milk.<br />Pros<br />- Toddler Formula that my Toddler actually loves<br />- Less expensive than the leading brand<br />- Great nutrition for your toddler<br />- Great if your toddler will not drink Milk<br />- My pediatrician actually recommends this and Similac go and grow for toddlers.<br /><br />cons<br />- The product seems to need to be shaken up in the sippy cup or bottle more than most before it can be drank TL;DR great option for Toddlers"
"This is the best brown rice we've ever found.<br />It was discontinued at the grocery stores in our area, but it is (still) available from amazon.com.  When our Pack of 6 is gone, we'll certainly re-order.<br />Highly recommended ! TL;DR Best brown rice"
"dog likes it, wife likes that dog likes it, reasonable price through Amazon. does it clean dog teeth? - darned if I know TL;DR dog chews"
"I have three dogs, two who have allergies and one also has to take big herb pills to help with her acupuncture treatments. These pill pockets are wonderful for giving them their meds everyday. I buy the capsule  size ones and break them in half, which is plenty enough to hide a pill in. My dogs love the taste and gulp them right down. I really love the ease of using these. So much better than the struggle we used to have getting their meds down! TL;DR My Dogs love pill pockets"
"Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix is a great gluten-free mix!  I've tried several other mixes from our local health food/organic stores - Whole Foods and Trader Joe's - and Pamela's is by far the best.  I've made several of the recipes listed on the bag of mix and so far the absolute best recipe is the pancakes! I throw some blueberries into the pancake batter, which helps to make the pancakes tasty, light and airy - they don't give you that ""stuffed"" feeling after eating them.  My husband and I believe these pancakes are better than the flour versions.  Pamela's Wheat Free Bread mix is good, too - makes a nice loaf of sandwich bread.  Thanks Pamela's!! TL;DR Great gluten free baking mix"
"I have tried a lot of V8 products and this one pretty much topped them all.  A little ice in a blender, top it off with V8 Splash Smoothie Tropical Colada and you have one heck of a Smoothie.  Thanks Amazon.com. TL;DR A Splashing Tropical Smoothie"
"Gonna make this short and sweet. I use it to *shallow* fry lot's of food. I take it also just as it is when I am feeling lazy and don't feel like eating. After a 4 day juice fast, I started a vegetarian diet, with next to no meat (I currently don't eat meat or eggs, or any dairy products), HIGH plant fats, probably a couple pounds of fruits and veggies every day, and lots of coconut milk. Oh, and lets not forget beans and rice, unprocessed kinds of course. Despite my high fat diet, I am dropping fat weekly. While there may or may not be a profound effect with this oil, I can safely say that it hasn't added any fat. In fact, I am pretty certain that it aids in fat metabolisation. Plus, you get a rare type of MCT with this product, which makes up nearly 70% of the fat contained in the oil.<br /><br />On a side note... DON'T BE AFRAID OF PLANT FATS!! You want to lose weight? Stop eating processed foods (ALL TYPES), eat beans and bulk rice (Wild, Forbidden, Long Grain Brown, Red Rice etc..), nuts/seeds, nutbutter and coconut! Oh, and veggies too of course. Its easy AND CHEAP to eat well. It took me quite some time to be able to figure out how to eat so well on a less than stellar budget, but it can be done! &lt;3 TL;DR It Works"
"This International Coffee was a balanced blend of the taste of coffee,chocolate and peppermint.  It was smooth (no tart overpowering coffee taste) and did not leave an aftertaste as some powdered hot drinks do.  I did find that as a dedicated chocoholic that I had to put in more than the recommended amount in order to get the flavor that was satisfying to me.  When it is made with milk it becomes a rich drinking experience.  When it is made with water the flavor is much more light.  Overall I would purchase this and would recommend it to others who need their peppermint fix! TL;DR Christmas in a cup!"
"I had been struggling with low milk supply, and this tea really works.  I had seen a significant milk increase when drinking this tea.  I tried many different products, including fenugreek pills, More Milk Plus liquid and capsules, and fennel.  They all work, and the best one is More Milk Plus in liquid form.  This tea is a good value, and it works as well. TL;DR It works!"
My big chain retailer stopped carrying this product.  I was so happy to have been able to find this thru amazon.com.  This is a great product and would highly recommend it. TL;DR Great Product!
"This is an exceptional value for really, REALLY good coffee.  It's just what a breakfast blend should be - a bit mild, but with enough ""oomph"" to kickstart your morning.  Out of all of the coffees I've tried, this is hands-down my absolute favorite. I was a bit leery after trying, and not caring for, the Rainforest blend, but this is nothing at all like that blend, it's just perfectly suited for my tastes.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've moved onto Fogchaser now, which is just a tiny bit stronger, and have a new favorite. ;) TL;DR My2nd favorite, excellent value"
"I'm not sure what has twisted the tales of other reviewers, this is fine dog food.  I was worried I had missed something and checked the contents of other dog foods I trust- namely Kirkland Signature adult dog food (some say Diamond makes it for Costco).  Long story short, this dog food is competitive with top brands.<br />I have two spoiled Labrador Retrievers and they thrive on this stuff.  Astre is quite picky and loves this stuff, both have beautiful glossy coats, excellent health, good energy.  Absolutely no reason to think this is anything other than good quality dog food. TL;DR Good Dog Food"
This spice I have found is packed in a large wide mouth jars. It has a very fresh flavor. I use it by the teaspoon full in my sauces. Its packed for easy storing and can be put in a smaller shaker say a dry cheese dispenser for the stove top.<br />  This is a great way to stock up on your favorite spices. Look at the per lb. price in the box store. You will be shocked! With Amazon free shipping one can not go wrong. TL;DR Wow Lots of Oregano
"Not only does Total Raisin Bran taste good, it's also low in calories and good for the digestive system- if you know what I mean! When I received this 6 pack, all the boxes were in tact and shrink wrapped together. I'm happy. TL;DR I like this better than the ""other"" raisin cereal"
"Often, foods that are targeted toward being free of an undesirable ingredient end up being heavy with other ingredients to make up for it - anyone remember the ""fat-free"" craze that gave us sugar-heavy, calorie-laden foods?<br /><br />I was concerned that these would have a cloyingly sweet flavor to make up for the lack of wheat and dairy - I was pleasantly surprised to find just the opposite.  Actually, my first bite immediately took me back to the days in the 80's when my mom tried to find healthier ways to make cookies without sugar.  Sorry to say, Mom's experiments didn't work out well... but with only 8 grams of sugar per bar, these would make Mom proud.<br /><br />I found enough chocolate to tip the scales from ""unsweet"" into ""just right"".  The almonds, coconut, and oats give a great texture that took a while to chew up, making the eating experience more satisfying.<br /><br />These were really great warmed up!  I ate my first one straight from of finding the package in my mailbox (summer + Texas = baked mail), and it was like eating a fresh cookie straight from the oven.  I had to stop myself from eating another one right away!<br /><br />Just for fun, I tried another one chilled.  This was also pretty good - the softness of the bar plus the cold made it a nice treat on a hot day.<br /><br />At the current Amazon price, it works out to about $.76 per bar, which is a fair price for a snack with less sugar than your average granola bar, and better ingredients, too. TL;DR Tastier than expected!"
The popcorn was very good.  The can was sealed and this kept the popcorn fresh. TL;DR Gourmet Popcorn
"This cereal has changed for the gross.  I didn't buy my latest can on Amaon, rather Target, so it's obviously a Happy Bellies issue & not Amazon.  The color of the cereal is a nasty grey/green and it smells awful.  I was wondering why my babies weren't really that enthusiastic about eating.  I like the added DHA & probiotics, but looks like I'll be going back to Earth's Best Oatmeal cereal.  Another company trying to skimp out on high quality ingredients, just to make a quick buck. TL;DR Yep, They Changed the Formula..."
"I was really looking forward to sampling this product. It's not bad, but a little too sweet-tasting for me. Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages. TL;DR I wanted to like it more"
"You know when you see Velveeta that your getting a thick and cheesy flavor.  Velveeta appears to be branching out from the mac & cheese business for a stab at, well, Hamburger Helper.  The price point is great.  The preparation is easy and quick, but the final product falls short of expectations.  The hamburger flavoring dominated the meal.  The thick gooey Velveeta cheese gets quickly eaten up by any excess water in the pan making it thin and runny.  The taste was good, but not the thick, cheesy goodness that I expected. TL;DR Looks thick and cheesy on box"
"I'm a bit of a popcorn addict and this bag was the best idea ever. I got a popper for Christmas, so got this once the little sample container with the popper got used up. I love this popcorn, for price and taste. I don't eat popcorn plain, so the lack of taste people wrote about doesn't really apply to me. I also don't usually have many, if any, unpopped kernels. The popcorn is large and yummy! And awesome for the price! TL;DR Love it!"
"we really liked this one.  some of the frontier soup's seasoning packets taste a little odd to me, but not this one.  This tastes so very natural.  Takes very few extra ingredients.  DON'T forget the red cooking wine, though.  really makes it.  Also, i found that my lentils cooked a lot sooner than they said on the package.  Instead of 1.5 hours, it took only about 1 hour from start to finish. TL;DR love it!"
"stumped by a hard to chew review, maybe with no teeth, as this is easy to cut and chew, not like nearly rock hard cured italian meats; taste is slightly spicy- about halfway between sweet and hot sausage for comparison; and a very good deal; ordered a top-rated pepperoni, one stick, was $13 and over $9 for ship+handle (won't do that again); this is 4 chubs, probably 6+ times the weight and size, but only $23 and $6 ship+handle; can't say it very often but a good product that's underpriced TL;DR top taste+value"
"I love the whole grain breads and this is excellent.  It is almost fool proof.  Being a man I some times think I remember the directions.  Wrong!  There are just 2 things I had to add, well I forgot to put the oil in the first loaf.  The loaf didn't rise as much as the other loaves but was still very good.  I remembered everything in the 2nd loaf and it was perfect.  I put cold water instead of warm for the 3rd loaf and it was perfect.  Was I just lucky?  I will read the box every time from now on. TL;DR Excellent bread"
"These figs are excellent, firm and sweet.  I found the figs sold on Amazon in the smaller cans in a 6 pack rather mushy, tho no doubt it is a matter of taste and some may prefer a soft fig. Since I only eat a few at a time, I transfer the big can's contents into two smaller containers and refrigerate them.<br /><br />One thing tho, these cans are enormous and very heavy. Don't order them with anything else in the same order or they'll crush the other items - even books may be damaged.  And the cartons are really not strong enough -they usually arrive in pretty bad shape tho the cans themselves have never been damaged. But great figs tho and worth it. TL;DR Excellent product, just watch the packing"
"I normally buy the generic version of powdered Splenda from Walmart.  Haven't done the math but, I'd bet the farm that I can sweeten DOUBLE the volume of tea or coffee with the Walmart generic sweetener.  This stuff lasted no time! TL;DR Expensive"
"Our golden retriever has a much easier time digesting this good old fashioned food than the ""natural"" stuff that is the current rage.<br /><br />The delivery was on time. TL;DR A lot of food in a timely manner"
Not on your life.  This stuff was fabulous.  I crave peanut butter and I could eat one serving of it for a snack and be totally satisfied.  compare to regular peanut butter: 180 calories and 16gms fat for 2 tbs.  PB2: 45 calories and 1.5gms fat.  It tastes just like regular peanut butter.  The chocolate one didn't have much chocolate flavor but it tasted okay.  This time around I am just buying the regular flavor.  Yum.  So many things you can use it in.  I can't wait to experiment more. TL;DR Too good to be true?
"I decided to buy this because the stores hardly ever have Heath Bars.  I would have preferred to have regular single-packaged bars but the price on these was quite good.  The king size is simply two regular 1.4 oz bars packaged together.  The only problem (and I don't know who is to blame here) is that every single bar is broken -- some broken multiple times.  Like I said I don't know if Amazon shipped them this way, or if it happened during shipment.  They came in a box with those air bags but should have probably been shipped in peanuts or some other impact-absorbing material.  Anyway it doesn't matter for just us nibbling on them at home, but it would matter if they were being using in gift baskets or something like that. TL;DR Fave Candy"
"I have to agree with the previous review that noted the taste of pickles in this pesto. That's exactly what I thought upon tasting it. It tastes like a combination of pickles and olives, which isn't an inedible combination, but not one I expected or particularly wanted. The part that made it almost inedible was the salt, and that's coming from someone who enjoys processed foods. This was just over-the-top salty. I'm just going to throw the stuff away. Shelf-stable pesto is a nice idea, but the refrigerated variety is the way to go. TL;DR Doesn't taste like pesto."
My two mongrels gobble down all treats but they didn't do it this time! They had to chew and chew on these babies to get to the end.<br /><br />They must taste really good to the dogs because I had my daughter's two dogs here with my own pair and all four growled and guarded their individual Funbites. I'm sure that these treats are good for maintaining the dogs' teeth and I would highly recommend them. TL;DR Long lasting!
"sweet tasty but there is not sugar ,baby love it.Better than gerber.Like  Mellin ,Milupa or Plasmon brand. TL;DR baby food Nestle`"
These soba noodles are delicious and have NO SALT ADDED.  More soba found in stores is laden with salt.  I will definitely buy these again! TL;DR Excellent!
Just bought 4 boxes.  All were received in excellent shape!  These are wonderful and only 50 calories a cookie!!!!!  Will definitely order more when these are gone! TL;DR Like homemade!
This is one of those items you will want to keep in your pantry for a fast and satisfying meal.  A thick soup that has a perfect blend of sweet and spicy (for a thinner version add a can of chicken broth).  Perfect for autumn...worked great for a tail-gate party! TL;DR Sweet & Spicy -  Delicious & Easy
"I use these crackers in place of Ritz and Premium crackers which contain high fructose corn syrup in them.  This particular batch was simply way undercooked so they were pale and crumbly.  I'm waiting for the company to get back to me regarding a refund, and unfortunately it's taking quite a while. TL;DR This batch was undercooked, but good crackers typically."
"I've been having trouble w/my skin lately and thought this tea might help. I steeped one tea bag for a few minutes just to wet the leaves and then tore it open. I combined the wet tea leaves w/one teaspoon plain organic yogurt and spread the mix on my face. I soaked a washcloth in the hot tea water and when it was cool enough, placed it over my face and relaxed for 30 min. My skin feels so much better in just one application; much less irritated and it feels moisturized and calm. I highly recommend giving this a try for anyone who might have acne and have ""tried everything."" If you don't want the mess and might be having a breakout in just one small area, simply place a warm teabag on your skin without removing the insides and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. Of course, drink the tea as well to cleanse from the inside out. TL;DR Incredible face mask too"
This is one of my favorite granolas.  (I like granola without cinnamon and without dried fruit.)  Amazon Subscribe & Save is the cheapest way to buy it (unless your local grogery store is having a big sale on it and you have a manufacturer's coupon). TL;DR Good Granola
I picked up a bag of these on a regular shopping trip. They were on sale and so I thought what the heck. I am so glad I did. This candy is amazing. Such gloriously full flavors and just sweet enough to get rid of a sugar craving. I buy them all the time now and I love them. TL;DR Best sugar free hard candy out there
"Great way to have ""pasta"" without the carbs.  Just remember to rinse.  My family can't tell the difference!<br />I recommend for diabetics as well as anyone who wants to avoid extra calories TL;DR Great pasta substitute"
"I love the taste and, if you don't mind placing the jar into warm water before use, it is a great honey. I just prefer a thinner honey for my uses. We loved the taste, but just a little to thick for our use. TL;DR Love the taste"
"I am a fan of White Hot Chocolate, and this doesn't even come remotely close to the flavor. It is similar to 1% milk with some sugar added to it. My son wouldn't even touch the stuff, said it was horrible. I tried adding it to a cup of regular coffee, and it ruined a good cup of coffee. Those who gave this 5 starts obviously have no clue what good White Hot Chocolate tastes like! Gross, don't waste your money. TL;DR Taste's nothing like White Hot Chocolate"
"We recently changed our dog's normal food because she has gotten picky and no longer wants to eat the premium brand we've bought for several years.  We've tried several types thus far and she likes them all (who says dogs don't need variety in their food?).  Since the Chef Michael's was offered as part of the Amazon Vine program, I decided to give it a try.  The first day of trying Chef Michael's, as soon as I mixed it with her current food, she gobbled the whole bowl.  That's different for her.  She usually leaves some of her food so she can eat throughout the day.  As time has gone by, I've noticed she will dig through the bowl of mixed food and pick out the Chef Michael's pieces, eat them first and then nibble on the other brand in the bowl.  If she leaves any food in the bowl to come back and eat later in the day, it's always the other food, not Chef Michael's.<br /><br />Yes, the Chef Michael's food is expensive but it's not out of line with other the other premium dog foods we've been buying at the pet store.  As a matter of fact, it's considerably lower priced than some of them.  So price is not really a big factor in buying this dog food if you've been buying premium brands all along.<br /><br />The ingredients are consideration, however.  Some of the ingredients in the Chef Michael's is not exactly on the politically correct list for healthy eating.  For that reason, we will probably continue to follow our current procedure of mixing a little of the Chef Michael's with a larger quantity of another type of premium and better nutritionally balanced food.  Our pooch loves it and adding a little pizzazz to her meals brightens up her day.  That's worth a lot.<br /><br />If this review was based on nutritional value alone, I would probably give it 3 stars.  It's not really bad as far as nutrition is concerned but it's not as good as other foods within the same price range.  But I bow to the family dog whose opinion is paramount. TL;DR The family dog gives it 5-stars...so I'll go along with her"
"Right product, great price, fast shipping.  You can't go wrong with this company.  Extract is thicker than expected, by stronger so you need less. TL;DR Perfect..."
"I ordered 5 lb of this candy, and it was great. So great in fact that I ate a lot of it. After a few days, my teeth became incredibly sensitive from the amount of acid in this candy. Sour candy gets its sour from different kinds of acid, and this candy is so sour, it's really bad for your teeth. Eating a lot of sour candy of any kind will begin to damage the enamel on your teeth. TL;DR Candy is great, but isn't good for your teeth"
This juice is amazing...never tasted anything like it before. Definatly my favorite juice. But......the price not so much. $90 is a little steep for some juice that would last me maybe a month. TL;DR Nantucket Nectars- Pomegrante Cherry
"My gluten-free (milk-free, soy-free, egg-free) 9-year-old loves it.  The taste and texture of the flour in sandwich bread is great.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not like wheat bread, but it IS delicious.  I'm not gluten-free, but I prefer this over wheat bread.  I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about when they say the bean taste is overpowering or the aftertaste is bitter.  We love the taste!  It's so much more convenient than trying to mix the flours at home, too.  We're big fans!  I can't wait to try it in cookies, pancakes, and other items! TL;DR Exellent taste and texture!"
I cannot stand the artificial taste of all the other sugar replacements and sweeteners. This is the most delicious sweetener I've tried in my quest to get rid of refined sugar. TL;DR As delicious as everyone says it is
"Our oldest cat has problems with urinary tract blockages.  After the 3rd time to the vet in the past few years, they suggested giving coenzyme supplements for healthy bladder function.  Well he HATES pills.  It takes two people to give him his pills and he is not a happy camper.  These little puppies came in handy for prednisone, and now with coenzyme supplements.  Unfortunately these cannot hold a whole coenzyme supplement (even emptying the pill contents in the pill pocket), so I tried mushing 2 pill pockets and mixing the coenzyme powder with it.  Works like a charm! TL;DR My cat loves it!"
These taste just like the valentine hearts you used to be able to buy in the pink box with the see through cello  heart on the box.  YAY!!!!  The new formula hearts that are out are absolutely gross!!!!  These taste great...you won't be disappointed. TL;DR Original taste of the valentine hearts
"Julia's Pantry Organic Steel Cut Oats are the best I've ever had!! I used to purchase my oats in bulk from Whole Foods but now I am hooked on this delicious product. The texture is appealing and nutty and makes for a full bodied meal anytime of day. I mix mine with blueberries, walnuts and a pinch of brown sugar for a fantastic bowl of good-for-you yumminess. Thanks to Julia's Pantry for a great product!!! TL;DR Delicious!!"
"This item was previously available at a local candy store as a ""Cordial Egg"" at Easter time.  Am glad to find it available on Amazon. TL;DR A special Spring treat"
"Came packed in mylar bag that is typical of the frontier products I buy. But upon opening the bag it reeked of a very strong chemical smell that completley overpowered any of the sweet smell of nutmeg, I thought it smelled just like insecticide. Was immediately turned off.<br /><br />I went ahead and grated some up. It still smelled awful to me, so I compared it to some preground nutmeg I have in my cupboard for probably at least 8 to 10 years. The preground still smelled great, especially when compared to what I had just grated.<br /><br />So I took about 15 of the nuts and scrubbed them with scrubrush in hot soapy water, rinsed, dried, and then stored in new fresh storage container. They definitely smell some better now, but I am so turned off, I don't know if I can even try to actually use them. Yuck.<br /><br />I'm sorry I wasted my money. TL;DR strong chemical smell"
"These are great and not just for kids. I drink so much more milk since I've discovered them! Great way to get calcium and other nutrients on the run! Great for your desk so you can make that cream of whatever soup you stashed to save money on takeout lunch costs, great for your gym bag when you forgot to have a snack first, great for those who live alone, are rarely home and can never finish a bigger carton of milk! Great for those whose boyfriends keep only soda in the apartment, Great great great! TL;DR Not Just For Kids!"
"This coffee was a big hit with my coffee loving men. My dad said it was his dad's coffee...he calle it ""A&P coffee."" Must be a North Jersey thing.  Good price from Amazon compared to the local grocery store. TL;DR Great find"
"The fruit slices arrived after the estimated delivery date, but were exactly what I needed. I'm placing them on top of cupcakes for a bridal shower (lemon- lime themed). They seem very fresh and look fantastic! TL;DR Fruit Slices"
"Based on the reviews and the word 'Chai' on the container, I decided to try it...  I am disappointed...  The taste reminds me of the latte freeze you can buy at Costco... or the taste of the Starbuck's Bottled Frappachino's and powdered Nescafe latte.  Its really sugary and not at all spicy.  It has a fake non dairy milk taste to it...  If you are hoping for a taste similar to Oregon or Tazo Chai Concentrate... this is not the way to go...  I might drink it if I run out of Chai flavored tea bags or hot cocoa or palpable water... but I have a feeling it will be living on my kitchen shelf for a very long time...  I tried all the variations on how to prepare it, listed on the back of the container, and none of them inspired me to 'want' to drink the stuff... TL;DR It tastes fake..."
"I have two cats and neither will eat this food. I really wish they would because I've read that it's good for cats with allergies. Too bad because I'm running out of options. My cat has sores all over his skin and pukes a lot. The ZD prescription diet cat food is the only thing that has worked but the crappy ingredients in it cause the cats to become very lethargic and their coats become very dull. The ZD cat food has horrible ingredients as well.<br /><br />It would be nice to be able to find a cat food that the cats will eat, won't cause digestive or allergic reactions and won't require me to get a second job just to pay for the damn stuff. TL;DR My cats won't eat this"
"I adopted 2 semi-adult cats from the SPCA in April.  Boy have they got ME trained already!  One doesn't like crunchies, will only eat the EXPENSIVE dried fish treats, the other won't TOUCH those but open a bag of kitty junk food and she goes nuts.  Well needless to say this product fits the bill for her!  She LOVES them and will come from anywhere she might be reclining when she hears the shake of the bag.  A useful tool when it's time for cats to come in!  I don't know how much help the teeth cleaning part is, but she sure enjoys every bite of these morsels. TL;DR Kitty Junk Food"
These are good little crackers but not quite the goldfish taste we were looking for. Hard to get that flavor in a gluten free product I guess...still the closest we have been able to come to having our dearly missed little goldfish crackers. TL;DR Good but not great...
A very nice flavor with no after-taste. It gives off a nice fragrance while brewing and has a very satisfying taste. You have to have another cup! TL;DR Nice flavorful and full-bodied.
"First, you will note that I have given Blue Buffalo's ""Health Bars with Bacon, Egg and Cheese Treats for Dogs"" a five star rating - but that really wasn't my idea - rather that is the rating given to them by the Three Muske-Terriers: a male Westie, a male Cesky and, the Empress-of-All-She-Surveys, a female Scotty. To be honest, the Cesky and Her Highness will eat just about anything - but the Westie is a true gourmet. If a treat passes the ""Asta test,"" you know its got to be tasty - and these treats get five barks from Asta. But they are not just tasty, they're also good for your furry buddy, in moderation of course....<br /><br />Blue Buffalo's treats do NOT include wheat, corn or soy, (many dogs, including Her Highness, are allergic to these grains). Instead the ingredients include oatmeal, ground barley, ground whole oats, rye and flaxseed, along with chicken meal, bacon, dried eggs, cheese and carrots. The ingredients are all natural - although they are NOT organic, (if you are interested in organic treats, I suggest that you try those made by Robbie Dawg or Wagatha).<br /><br />The treats are baked for a nice crunch. They are rectangular - about an inch by an inch and a half, and maybe a quarter of an inch thick. They break in half easily, if you want to reduce the portion size.<br /><br />As for price, Blue Buffalo treats are in the same price range as treats made by other high-end and premium dog food manufacturers. They are not cheap, but I think their quality is worth the cost - and your dog probably will think so too. TL;DR Bacon and Eggs? Where Are the Hashbrowns?"
"Oh my! This Naan is so good. I love that it cooks up easily in the oven - no need to even thaw - just grab out the freezer and into the oven. The bread comes out hot, chewy, and delicious. I can eat it plain, but have had some amazing Indian themed dinners with other Tandoor Chef ingredients and rice. Just yummy and I will continue to purchase. The price appears high at first, but once you taste the quality you will not mind paying - I promise! TL;DR I am officially in love!"
"Baby is doing very well on this formula. I'm happy to say that it is non binding (does not cause constipation), non staining, and seems to be gentle on baby's stomach as well. We have tried 2 other formulas that were organic, because I was hoping to go the organic route. But 1 of them caused severe constipation, and the other slight constipation. So this has been our go to formula.<br /><br />Someone else had posted ingredients that are no longer correct, so I will post the new ingredients here. - Nonfat milk, lactose, vegetable oil (palm olein, coconut, soy, and high oleic sunflower oils), whey protein concentrate, galactooligosaccharides*, polydextrose*, and less than 1%: mortierella alpina oil**, crypthecodinium cohnii oil+, calcium carbonate, potassium citrate, ferrous sulfate, potassium chloride, magnesium oxide, sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, cupric sulfate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, soy lecithin, choline chloride, ascorbic acid, niacinamide, calcium pantothenate, vitamin A palmitate, vitamin B12, vitamin D3, riboflavin, thiamin hydrochloride, vitamin B6 hydrochloride, folic acid, vitamin K1, biotin, inositol, vitamin E acetate, nucleotides (cytidine 5-monophosphate, disodium uridine 5-monophosphate, adenosine 5-monophosphate, disodium guanosine 5-monophosphate), taurine, L-carnitine.<br /><br />*A type of prebiotic.<br />** A source of arachidonic acid (AHA)<br />+ A source of docosahexenoic acid (DHA) TL;DR Baby Thriving on This"
"8/21/10 I'd like to update my review of late last year.  I found out that the weak coffee  wasn't the fault of the K-cups after all, but a malfunction at the time with my Keurig.  Tried it again after that issue was solved, and, I do like it after all.  Might even re-order it. :)  I like the aroma, not convinced that it really has an Irish Creme ""taste"".  Changing from 1 to 3 stars.  Will update you later.<br /><br />Earlier review: Nice aroma, but weak, watery coffee.<br />This flavor Not recommended.  BTW, I do love the Timothy's Cinnamon Pastry and some other Timothy's flavors, but not this one. Very disappointed, and, unfortunately grocery products not returnable. TL;DR Nice aroma, but weak, watery coffee - Not so bad after all!"
There are not many things that taste good that you can eat an entire bag for 1.5 grams of fat!  This product is great for diets and an awesome alternative to chips.  They taste great and are filling.  So glad I discovered them.  Also the company has fantastic customer service if needed. TL;DR Smart Fries- Best snack ever!
I bought this waffle mix to make waffles for three breakfasts at a family reunion and the waffles were delicious!!! (and I only added water). The waffles only lasted two days because they were yummy! Everyone wanted one. TL;DR Family reunion hit
We have a lot of heavy coffee drinkers who appreciate very strong coffee.  Senseo Dark Roast satisfies them and gives them the richness and boldness of very fine coffee. TL;DR Senseo Dark Roast
"this stuff is candy water - if you like sweet sugary drinks, then why even bother with kombucha? - isn't coke zero more what you're looking for? It's completely clear so there aren't any live cultures I can see, though I'm not sure they can survive in the ingredients listed on the bottle anyway - I know I can't. It's cheaper than GT Dave's variety, but it tastes nasty, all bubbly, minty and sweet at the same time. Like a party in my mouth with a bunch of uninvited guests - seriously, stay away! TL;DR really?"
"My Yellow Labrador as a puppy would vacuum his food up at feeding time. This product controlled that immediately. My current puppy is the fourth one using this dry kibble. I know they are being optimally nourished using Royal Canin. Their only treats are carrots, apple slices and frozen broccoli. All four grew up into magnificent specimens with no problems or issues. They all had a great coats, no digestive problems and clean teeth. While I only have them for 18 months while puppy training, I do get to see them as they graduate as Guide Dogs knowing they had a good start with this kibble.<br /><br />Amazon makes it easy to have it delivered to your door at substantially less cost than the big box pet stores. No driving, less cost, great product delivered to your front door. TL;DR EXCELLENT PRODUCT, convenient, and a great value"
"My kids love most of the Happy Tot flavors, including this one.  The price is great with subscribe and save. TL;DR kids love it"
I ordered it for healing purposes and it has no energy in that direction so I have one pound of useless cinnamon TL;DR not for healing purposes
I was looking for a good powdered eggnog mix like the one Kroger used to sell a few years ago.  It was very creamy rich with an excellent egg and rum flavor.  This McSteven's Holiday Blend Eggnog is pale and watery with a strong nutmeg taste. TL;DR Just okay.
"I just purchased a Tassimo coffee and drink maker (from Amazon, of course), and the Cappucino and Latte pods to use with it. I love the Cappucino and Latte, they are wonderful treats in the AM, or anytime, for that matter, but I wanted to flavor my drinks with something more. The Torani Syrups are wonderful, because they can be used for flavoring coffee, tea, even ice cream, and I get the full coffee house experience without leaving my home! Great...and really good, too. TL;DR Yummy!"
"I really enjoyed this fresh fragrant Jasmine White tea for what it was, but I would never personally spend so much for it.<br /><br />Perhaps I am not enough of a connoisseur to fully appreciate the subtle differences between this and other Jasmine teas I have also enjoyed.  Maybe I am just a cheapskate, but I can't justify buying something 4-5 times more expensive for a moderate increase in (discernible) quality.  My star rating is based on cost averaged against taste. Cost= 2stars taste= 4stars TL;DR Nice floral flavors... but at such a high price!"
"I'm giving this 5 stars but only if you're experienced in handling a really slack, soft dough and because it's so complete, authentic and VERY good tasting.  It really should only give it 4 stars because the yeast was dead - so proof it before you rely on it!  I put it in my bread machine on the 'dough' cycle and when it got all done and ready to form, it was flat as a flitter.  It was late at night so I just got out a teaspoon of my own SAF yeast and started it over - other brands would need 2 teaspoons.  I let it run long enough to get really mixed in, stopped the machine, dumped the really sticky dough from the pan into a quart sized (un-oiled) zip top bag and tossed it in the fridge until the following evening.  I would recommend that everyone give it an overnight rest in the fridge.  The dough wasn't nearly as sticky and was a 'piece of cake' to handle, albeit, I don't recommend making it in a hot kitchen.  The dough is easier to work with in a cool environment.  Keep just a light dusting of flour on your surface being careful not to work in too much extra flour...when you're rolling it out and it keeps shrinking back, just let it rest there on your dough board for 10 minutes and roll it out some more, rest again, until you get it rolled out.  I didn't get it to measurements - I stopped at about 12""X18"" and it still ended up being a lot longer as I rolled it up.<br /><br />I suggest to definitely use the cream cheese and lightly toasted chopped pecans then dust with the praline sugar that's included in the package.  It could use more than an 8oz. pkg. of cream cheese, I think.  As you roll it up, sorta pull it toward you as you roll so you can roll it up fairly tight and get lots of swirls in it when you cut it.  It's real easy to make it into a circle and put the two ends together...kinda push one end up into the other one and just stretch the other end dough over it and you can hardly find the seam!<br /><br />I baked it on a parchment lined 13"" pizza pan.  Form it on your work surface and move it to the pan, get it as round and even as you can - brush with egg wash - 1 egg and whisk in a tablespoon of water. Put a cup of water in your microwave and let it boil.  Quickly but carefully take the cup out of the oven and put your cake in there and close the door and you've got a perfect environment for it to raise - don't open the door until it's raised big and puffy.  It gets a lot bigger than you'd think!  It completely filled the 13"" pan to the edges.  Watch it as it bakes and if it gets brown on top, make a circle out of foil and just set it lightly over the top and it'll continue to brown the sides without overdoing the top.<br /><br />It says to use 1 1/2 tablespoons of vanilla or water to make the glaze.  Unless you have white vanilla, use water.  Regular vanilla turned it yucky tan and I tossed it and made my own with just water.  The cake is blooming with flavor so you don't really need the vanilla essence in the glaze.<br /><br />I had never seen, eaten, made nor even heard of a King Cake before.  I have dear friends that met in New Orleans and wanted to surprise them out here in Arizona in the middle of September with a king cake for their birthdays...and a surprise it was!  He asked me if I was surprised that he knew that it was a king cake and I said no because you lived in New Orleans, were YOU surprised that I knew what one was!  They were flabbergasted to say the least - and blown away when I told them there was a baby Jesus in it (under it), too!  I will order more mixes and make them for the holidays and during Mardi Gras - and any other time I want to impress!<br /><br />When you look at your huge, beautiful, unique cake, you'll definitely see that it's totally worth the $7-$8 you have in it!  My brother in Georgia sends me pecans fresh off his tree so I don't have to buy pecans.  He even takes them somewhere and gets them shelled and sorted!  Lots of rain in the south this year so there should be an abundance of pecans!<br /><br />So, try it, you'll be really glad that you have to buy 2 when you order from Amazon! TL;DR INcredible cake!"
Tried to cut caffine in diet and like the Tetley brand.  It's hard to find in the stores at present.  Glad to order thru Amazon. TL;DR Decaf Tea
"This was the worst loose tea I have ever had.  I love Stash teabags, English breakfast, but this is bitter and not smooth.save your money TL;DR Terrible"
"Got a great deal for these rawhide bones.  My Pom/Beagle mix loves to chew and these are a great size for him.  They last a day or two before they're gone and are a great treat to mix in with others.  These are one of his favorites.  Fast shipping, as always, and this bulk pack will last a while for a great price. TL;DR Great Deal!"
"Having read the comments about these not browning, I cooked my first batch with the oven rack raised (2nd-to-top rack), and after waiting and watching, eventually found the perfect browned/done effect after about 25-28** minutes at 350 degrees. I use a jumbo-sized muffin aluminum pan, which makes 6 large muffins.  My muffins are beautiful and they taste as good as they look, but not too sweet. I follow the instructions to the letter (including stirring, not mixing, the milk and muffin mix at the end), with one exception: I add 1/4 tsp. more vanilla than instructed (3/4 tsp. vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. vanilla).  Then I've added 3/4 c. fresh blueberries to a few batches and 2 mashed ripe bananas to other batches.<br /><br />All of my batches have come out of the oven picture-perfectly raised to a gentle peak and golden-brown, not too dry on the bottom.  They are light and fluffy on the inside, buttery and slightly crispy on top.  Mine actually look better than the box (in my opinion, see photo); they rise a little higher than shown on the box.<br /><br />These muffins do tend to stick to the muffin paper unless you let them cool, initially.  When re-heating, I microwave them for 30 seconds and then remove the paper; I don't know why, but with this method the paper comes off very cleanly.  When either fresh out of the oven or chilled, the paper sticks; they need to be slightly warm to avoid the paper sticking too much.  Sometimes after microwaving and removing the paper, I will lightly toast it in the toaster oven to give the top a little crispiness.<br /><br />This mix seems to be very accommodating to alterations, as others have mentioned.  I am thrilled with this product and will buy it again.<br /><br />**I found I need to bake them a few minutes longer, up to 30 minutes, when using frozen berries rather than fresh berries, and 25 min. is sufficient when making these plain.  I have continued using the second-to-top rack because that works beautifully. TL;DR Yes, they do brown on top!"
Delicious coffee that came quickly and conveniently to my office.  All of the cups were intact and I saved money. TL;DR YAY
"Unusual to learn our local super markets no longer carry this product. It clearly is superior to any competing brands so it must be a pricing/discount vendor issue. Whatever, Amazon has it handy and my clan loves it so I use it all the time. The Masterpiece Steak Seasoning is also a 5-star product that's much better than all the other steak rubs. TL;DR Masterpiece is a Masterpiece"
"It always amazes me that there are not dozens of reviews here extolling the fine qualities of this tea.  I have drunk it pretty much every day for the last five years and I never get tired of it.  It's an excellent morning tea, is smooth without being insipid, and is almost impossible to ruin by oversteeping. Just use decent water.  I like a little stevia in it, as I'm a wimp. It brings out the natural sweetness of its malty, slightly floral style.  I just bought another two pounds. TL;DR the best tea"
This honey tastes great while eating few teaspoons or with Oatmeal or with tea. I even use with fruit salads. This is a great sugar substitute. I need to research why another reviewer mentioned china based. The bottle is also completely mess free and no drips and drops. Definitely recommend this brand based on quality. Have been using for over a year. TL;DR Tastes great and truly mess free
"i got this on sale for a great price.  i really like this brand and company, stevita, because they grow their own stevia organically (even though it's not certified organic) in brazil, and not china!!!  (i'm afraid of even certified organic foods from china).  the only reason i give it 4 stars is because it has a bit more of an aftertaste than other brands, but the quality of this brand is much better. TL;DR good product"
My dog loves this product & it is good for her. I can also use it as treats in her treat ball b/c the food is so small. Great for a small dog! TL;DR Halo dry dog food
I ordered this item as a Christmas gift but was disappointed when I received it. It is a sample set of everything which is little. I do not recommend unless thai is what you are looking for. I will not be ordering food sets online again. TL;DR Swiss Gift Set
"Good ingredients for your pet, not all fillers. Our Shepherd and Shiba Inus love the Natural Balance food. Highly recommended food! TL;DR Top Quality Food"
"Very uniform texture and big in size!<br /><br />Excellent quality, highly recommended with full body flavor!!! TL;DR Bob's Red Mill Fava Beans"
"I am addicted to sushi, which is an expensive addiction.  I always keep a tin of these at work and at home to satisfy the craving.  My boyfriend, who doesn't like sushi, really enjoys these too, so they aren't just for sushi lovers.  I believe they are roasted, so they are not as healthy as raw almonds, but they still make a great afternoon snack. TL;DR So good - tastes like sushi without the fish."
"I love having this just stashed in my bag. Super easy and healthy snack! The ingredient list is a bit long, but at least I can pronounce all of them! Definitely recommend!! TL;DR yummy"
"My dogs, my pet sitting dogs and dogs I meet about town love Liver Biscotti!  And I dont have to be concerned about giving it out to a dog with a sensitive tummy.  Superb training treat, you can carry so very many in a pocket! TL;DR Great Product"
These were very good cookies. I loved the texture and flavor. a nice surprise from a packaged cookie. I would buy again. TL;DR SunStrike
THIS IS A VERY GOOD OLIVE OIL.  I USE THIS TO MAKE SALAD DRESSINGS MOSTLY. TL;DR VERY GOOD OLIVE OIL
"I was most disappointed in the 2-Alarm Kit I bought yesterday (January 29, 2011).  I had bought it many times over the last several years but found that today's bowl of chili didn't taste as it used to.  It was rather 'bla' and is missing a distinct chili taste.  I was also disappointed with the coupon for $10,000 give-away vacation trip that closed nearly a month ago! TL;DR Disapointment"
Grinds brok da mouf!  Comfort food that puts your mind back to the sunny warm tropical islands of Hawaii (and a few pounds on to your body too). TL;DR Ono-licious
"I've tried a number of all natural/organic wet food brands for my fur babies, and they seem to like Newman's the best. They wont' even touch some brands, and when I'm spending over $1 per can, I can't afford to buy food they won't eat. Newman's seems to have really good ingredients that I can feel good about giving them, they all love it, and it's priced reasonable on Amazon, compared to the $2/can for organic stuff at my local stores. TL;DR All our cats love it!"
"Healthy snack in a right size package. I love the sunflower seed taste and the right amount of cocoa in it. Most snacks in the market are always too sweet or too salty, but this one has a balanced flavor. High fiber and low sodium. Great choice for on-to-go snack. TL;DR Healthy snack"
"I buy these for my dorm-living daughter and she is in heaven.  Fast and cheap, you can't beat this stuff. TL;DR kid food"
"They weren't kidding. This stuff burns a hole through you.  I love hot,hot,hot food and this will add that heat I want to all my meals.  I sprinkle this over meats and veggies before grilling or add a SMALL spoonful to my Ranch-Style Beans and life is good!  Be very careful about how much you use, VERY SPARINGLY!!! TL;DR Hotter than Hell!"
"This is a wonderful, rich cake mix.  My family and I are in love with this stuff.  It makes 14 cupcakes, big ones.  We freeze half for the kids to take to school for treats, the rest are consumed almost immediately!  My advice is to let the mix set for 15 minutes before baking, the liquid absorbs more and your cake will be even more moist!  I will be using Pamela's for a long time! TL;DR The BEST chocolate cake mix!"
I bought this flavor because I couldn't find the chocolate flavor by itself.  I am so happy I did buy it because it is my go to sweet.  I strongly recommend this flavor to everyone.  I only wish I could find a larger bag of them. TL;DR Love this flavor!!!
"For years now I've been curious about ""this leaf"" from South America. I've often seen it mentioned and tried on various travel programs, usually with glowing comments. Not knowing that the product was available in the USA, until recently I never tried it. A few weeks, ago while surfing Amazon, there in front of me were various products made with coca leaves. I was actually quite astonished as I was convinced it was unavailable here. With my adventurous nature I ordered a number of the products, some powdered, some whole leaves and some with roughly crushed leaves. I read up on various ways the leaves should be tried, from tea, chewing whole leaves with some added alkali as well as a sundry of other methods. I went into this exploration with a very positive attitude. Unfortunately I was soon disappointed. I don't believe that any of the products, no matter how they were used, had any effect on me whatsoever. While it's true that if you leave the product in touch with the tongue or gums it produces numbness, apart from that...... absolutely no effect whatsoever. Having spent almost $200 on these products needless to say I was quite annoyed.<br /><br />Surfing Google about the leaves available in the USA, apparently some, if not most or all of these products are modified to make them legal in this country. Just as you can buy decaffeinated coffee, these products can be modified or treated to remove many of the active chemicals native to this leaf. My guess is that the products I purchased were modified in this way, contrary to the assertions of the sellers.<br /><br />In view of this the best way to try these leaves is to book a trip to South America, something I don't plan on doing myself.<br /><br />As the saying goes, you win some and you loose some. With these leaves, I lost them all.<br /><br />I invite the supplier to comment on my review.<br /><br />Addendum  10/25/12<br /><br />Regarding the processing of the product prior to sale, I have been advised by Pijama Cafe and the Mysterious Bolivian that ""we only sell what it is under regulations."" I can only interpret that to mean that much of the alkaloid content has been reduced prior to selling the product..because as they state  ""we only sell what it is under regulations.""<br /><br />The home page on their website states<br /><br />""As coffee can be decaffeinated, the coca tea can also be decocainized. Just like ""decaf"" coffee does retain a minute quantity of caffeine, ""Decocainized"" coca tea will still contain a minute quantity of the drug. When the cocaine is removed, the amount of cocaine is small enough for the product to legally sell in the USA according to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs ""Wikipedia"" .........  ""  ""Some of our coca products are produced under processes that controls the amount of illegal alkaloids leaving behind only the beneficial alkaloids.""<br /><br />The notes above appears to answer all questions as to whether the product is or isn't processed. TL;DR Disappointed"
"Saw this advertised on Oprah, and I must say she was 100% on the money when she said ""it's the best"" you can't go wrong with this one & now that I found out I can order from Amazon I not only save on the cost and I won't have to ration the packs. TL;DR Yummy!"
"I am a fan of Uncle Sam's flaxseed cereal and I wanted to try another cereal to mix with it.  Skinner's has four ingredients: whole wheat kernels, raisins, salt, and barley malt.  I opened my first box and I found that the raisins were somewhat clumped together, but they are plump. It's just like Uncle Sam's cereal without whole flaxseeds and raisins. It has no high fructose corn syrup.  If sugar's your thing, add it yourself.  Skinner's is a welcome addition to my favorite healthy cereal hall of fame! TL;DR Better than Raisin Bran"
I use this for regular size cans of cat food.  I give the cats 1/2 can then refrigerate the rest.  This is a great product. TL;DR Great item
"Are you serious? No one in their right mind is going to pay that much for soda pop, and if I was the UPS driver, I would throw them at you if you did! Quite laughable. TL;DR ONE DOLLAR PER CAN? PLUS SHIPPING? REALLY?"
OMG!!  This is the best seasoning out there-the only thing that's better is the magic Blends poultry seasoning.  But I haven't found a magic blend that I didn't love!! TL;DR This is the best seasoning out there!!!
"I am always looking for healthy, low calorie snacks, so when I heard about Popchips, I was intrigued.  They are crunchy chips that are not fried, and not baked, but created using heat and pressure to make them pop into being.  Since I love sweet potato chips in general, I thought I would give these a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the color.  They looked a bit lighter in color to other sweet potato chips I have tried, and I think this is due to them not being fried.  They really looked the same color as fresh, cooked sweet potatoes.  I did not notice any particular smell, other than good old sweet potatoes.  So far so good.<br /><br />In terms of taste, I thought they tasted great.  The chips were nice and crispy, with only a hint of salt, so you really got to enjoy the naturally sweet flavor.  I can really see that these will help satisfy cravings for something crunchy, something salty, something sweet, and especially something that is all three.<br /><br />The texture is definitely not that of a typical potato chip.  They are lighter, crisper, and airy, not as dense as a rice cake, but not as greasy as a typical chip.  All in all, I was really pleased with them.  Someone looking for a healthy replacement, or enjoys other veggie chip type snacks would really like these, I think.  For a die hard chip lover, these would might not satisfy you upon first taste, but give them a couple of chances; personally I loved them.<br /><br />With the snack size bag being 100 calories, I am pretty sold on these as a healthy snack alternative.  This would be a great addition to a sandwich for lunch, or an in-between meal snack.  I am happy to add Popchips to my snack rotation. TL;DR I loved them!"
"its terrible. bad batch maybe, i went of the three reviews before me and that was a mistake. dont spend your money! TL;DR yuck"
"I like that Zipfizz isn't full of a bunch of crap.  It gets me out of my morning funk, and makes me start drinking water early.  I mix one tube with 32 oz of water, and have it in place of a morning cup of coffee.  It's not going to give you a ton of energy or get you wired.  It just moves you from tired to awake.  I like that zip fizz is 1/3 the cost of 5 hour energy.  Stay away from the Orange.  It tastes awful.  Grape and Pink Lemonade taste great. TL;DR My Morning Drink"
"the Gel colors are great to use. Blends well with fondant, cake mix and icing. Will not water down your mixture as the liquid food coloring might. I use this for all my food coloring needs. And the price cant be beat!<br /> This is a must have in everyone's kitchen. TL;DR Wonderful color  assortments"
It was great to find this product as it is not very popular around here. My only complaint is I paid almost as much for product as shipping which is why shopping online is not always very economical. TL;DR hard to find product
I bought this plant food for my son's science project. He was comparing different plant foods. We found that this worked equally well as Miracle-gro. TL;DR Works good
"Especially when you have to cut pills in half.  Greenies definitely make the task of getting those pills into cats a lot easier.  I've used them for cats who will voluntarily eat the whole pill and soft pill pocket all in one go, and to wrap the pill (the pill pockets are soft enough so that you can break them apart and 'wrap' around the pill, stretching out the pockets that way and making the whole 'pill package' a bit smaller) and pop it down the throats of those who unfortunately seem to figure out that there's something in the tasty treat (often by chewing on the pockets) and saving them the taste of the pill (great for cut pills or any meds that can produce a foaming/drooling effect).  Anything that makes 'medicine time' less of a stressful time for anything involved is a wonderful invention. TL;DR the joys of pilling a cat"
"I've been using this gravy mix for years, but it's nearly impossible to find it in stores these days. So I was very happy to find it on Amazon (at a great price). In addition to making quick and delicious white gravy, I use it to thicken the broth in my chicken and dumplings... Yum!! TL;DR LOVE this stuff!!"
The hole in the center of this Kap is just too large. Period. It spews grounds throughout the k-cup holding chamber and down into your coffee cup. Period. Every time.<br /><br />Huge waste of money. I cannot recommend. TL;DR Grounds leak out of that hole in the middle every time!
"I already drink this tea quite a bit, but the free shipping from Amazon made this a great price and too good to pass up.  I like that it has a medium-strength flavor and tastes good with just a little sugar. TL;DR Great price, great tea"
"This is a great product if you need a pick me up.  I bought it for post-skiing and post hot tub, when I start to fade!  I love the ability to carry it with me in my pocket or my purse.  I didn't have any side effects and the product seems to have a good combination of B vitamins.  I almost didn't purchase this product because of the one bad review that was posted.  I didn't experience anything that he posted with the nausea or jitters-- thought it was a much milder and healthier option than 5 hour energy and will definitely purchase again. TL;DR Great Energy Drink"
"This PB is great because it is only 45 calories per 2 tablespoons and 1.5 grams of fat.  It is great tasting - of course, it does not taste like Jiff (my favorite); its taste is similar to the natural PBs on the market.  Some people like or love peanut butter.  I'm obsessed with it.  It is so bad that this is the first PB that I have purchased in awhile because as soon as I buy PB, it is gone in one day (yes, I sit down and just eat spoonful after spoonful). TL;DR Very Yummy"
"This tea helps for constipation, I have nerve damage and I rather take a natural<br />product over precription drugs! I had a hard time getting this at first. I take two cups of water to one tea bag a day. TL;DR health benefits"
"These tortilla chips should be renamed to FoodDoesTasteGood!  So many times ""healthy"" or ""good for you"" snacks are as flavorless as water.  Good for you, but absolutely boring to the taste buds.  These chips, however break the rules.  No Trans Fat, 0.5% staurated fat. 18g carb, 3g dietary fiber, 2g sugars and 3g protein with only 140 calories per 1 ounce bag w/60 of them from non saturated (good)fats.  Remember, not all fat is bad.  Some fat, like these are needed for digestion and brain function.  The flavor is great.  They are filled with flax seed, whole grains, wheat, but have a crisp, thick feel without grainy flavor.  They have a salty flavor like that of a tortilla, but you don't need a topping or salsa for the flavor.  No itchy lips from to much salt like a regular tortilla and no salsa falling on your clothes!  I eat these just as a quick snack but have served them along with hummus, cheese and veggie sticks for a crowd.  I also toss them into my kids lunch instead of chips or pretzels.  Most of the time they take a couple bags because they share them!  I like the one oz. bags because they tide me over at that 3:00 snack time without letting me indulge with too many.  I've had the Olive and the chocolate, but the multigrain are by far my favorite.  Serve these at your next party, but make sure you have quite a few bags...you will need them. TL;DR FoodDOESTasteGood Multigrain"
"I bought these because they were recommended as a way to get finicky seniors and sick cats to eat.  My sick cat had to be coaxed to eat them, and they made her vomit almost immediately.  My other cat, who has IBD, likes them fine but doesn't love them, and they do not cause any ill effects in him.  I split the difference and gave them three stars for what the cats think, and I added a star, because these aren't processed and full of questionable ingredients.  I wouldn't feed them to a cat who has CRF (although they are all different, and what doesn't work for mine may work for yours), but I would recommend them over kibble treats (except Greenies - we love <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WUVZCK"">Feline Greenies, Beef, 3 oz. Package</a>). TL;DR Made CRF kitty violently ill.  IBD kitty likes them, though."
I have not eaten pea soup in a long time because peas are a high glycemic index food but the picture on the can looked really inviting so I thought I'd try it again.  And it is truly delicious!  The peas are el dente and most are whole halved peas not just a mushed up mess.  The flavor is that of definitely fresh peas with enough ham pieces (though very little in size) to be perfection for the taste buds in every mouthful.  The salt content is really high though so one must not eat more than one can every other day at the most.  The flavor is really delightful and I highly recommend this soup if you can tolerate the high salt levels.  It is truly a scrumptious soup! TL;DR DELICIOUS!
"I like every one of these syrups and the price is right. I really didn't want the raspberry but its very good. Served flavored cappuccinos to my Bible study group and they loved them too, especially the Irish Cream. My favorite is Hazelnut followed by Vanilla. Hard to find Torani where I live so, so I'm happy I can reorder on Amazon. There is no artificial sweetener aftertaste as long as you don't overdo it on the quantity you use per beverage. It's great in yogurt too! TL;DR 6 Great Flavors"
"tree arrived healthy and looking good ..its been 2 months and its doing fine and about to loose leaves ..i wired some of the branches down so i can trim in spring....its worth the price, if you want a perfect tree with no marks it gonna cost alot more, so some wire marks are ok for a tree from a big farm ... i will make it look like a real bonsai in spring TL;DR looked just like picture"
"I recently gave up coffee and decided to try three different coffee substitutes: Roastaroma, Cafix, and Pero. Although Cafix tasted the most like real coffee (and it tastes *a lot* like real coffee), and all three products are pretty good, Roastaroma was my favorite.<br /><br />It is very similar to coffee, but it doesn't quite have the bitter bite of coffee. Those of you who are looking for that slight bitterness might prefer Cafix. Roastaroma actually reminds me a little bit of Mexican hot chocolate--the cinnamon and carob flavors come through pretty strongly in the drink, giving it a cinnamon-chocolatey flavor. I used to drink coffee to satisfy my sweet tooth on low calories. This drink totally fits the bill for this purpose.<br /><br />The Pero is pretty good, too. Like Roastaroma, it doesn't have the bitter coffee taste, but it still makes for a decent imitation of decaf. I like to drink it with cinnamon-flavored powdered creamer. Pero's a good value, too: it's strong enough that you don't need to use very much to flavor your whole drink. I drink the Pero when I'm trying to ration the Roastaroma out to myself so as not to run out.<br /><br />So Roastaroma has the best flavor, Cafix tastes the most like coffee, and Pero is a good back-up.<br /><br />A quick note on Postum: I do not care for it. I find that people who like Postum tend to be people who were never coffee drinkers. It tastes nothing like coffee. If you try Postum as a coffee substitute, you will be disappointed. TL;DR Review of Roastaroma, Cafix, Pero, and Postum"
"While I don't have more than 4 soft drinks a week, I make an exception for Jarritos, especially the lime flavor here. It's cheap, tastes perfect, comes in a glass bottle which helps with the taste, and uses real cane sugar instead of whatever the guys at Coke use. If you're looking for a lime soda that actually tastes like lime, go with this. Every sip I take of the lime flavor is savored, and I never want to rush through a bottle. If the drug cartels in Mexico fought eachother over Jarritos, I'd understand.<br /><br />But I want to let any potential customers who are health nuts to know that while this is only a 13.5 oz bottle, if you drink the whole thing in one sitting like most will, it counts as two servings. 28g of sugar and 29g of carbs per serving makes this a bit more (health-wise) than the usual drinks available. Also, I'd recommend looking for these in your local grocery stores, as they're much cheaper than what's being shown here. TL;DR Is it legal to taste this good?"
I had no problems with this. It grows extremely fast! I had to fight with my cats just to keep them out of it while it was still growing. :) I will be buying this again. TL;DR Great!
"There's nothing like introducing one to their first malted shake, about a lifetime ago at Berger's Pharmacy (N.Clark St. Chicago) when Dad split a chocolate malt with me, the wonderful taste and watching the shimmering<br />Green River sign behind Mr. Berger.<br /><br />Over the years I have noticed malted milk powders are just obscure in many areas of the south and desert southwest, in a major city it's usually on the shelf.<br /><br />Now I'm using soy milk and the carnation malted mix is a good way to supplement nutrition not to mention flavor enhancement. TL;DR Old fashion soda fountin flavor, every kid from 5 to 75 loves this!"
"Why purchasing this flour that is imported instead of regular everyday flour?<br />Well, for making pizza, it makes a huge difference.<br />- Lighter crust<br />- crispier<br />- dough feels smooth and easier to stretch.<br />You might not want to use another flour after trying this. TL;DR Yes, it does make a difference"
"I like strong coffee, and jet fuel is one of my favorites. The Keurig individual packages ensure that the coffee always taste fresh. TL;DR Robust Coffee"
This sauce is so good. I am not that goo with cooking so i am glad i bought this sauce. It is exotic with cocounuts. TL;DR Very good
MADE IN CHINA..<br />Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I won't be back to this vendor.<br />Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only..... TL;DR Hartz Rawhide Chew Sticks Pack of 20
"This is a delicious, smooth, sweet mustard that's perfect for anyone who wants a higher honey-to-mustard ratio than many mustards. If you like quite a bit of zip in your mustard, keep looking, because this is fairly mild. TL;DR Sweet and delicious"
"My husband loves pumpkin spice coffee, but unfortunately it is not available year round in our grocery stores.  When I looked on Amazon, I discovered this.  I was a little concerned about the ""vanilla nut"" part, because it's not a flavor he usually likes.  However, this was excellent!  For those looking for vanilla, this probably won't cut it, but pumpkin spice fans should enjoy it.<br /><br />The price is very reasonable, especially if you don't have to pay shipping.  Highly recommended! TL;DR Great taste, good price"
"I make it in a press and add cream it is quite tasty and not bitter like coffee,I had heard of a drink called choffy and I think this came very close, I enjoyed it . TL;DR Good non sweet cocoa ,better than coffee"
"This product eliminates the hassle of digging through a giant diaper bag.  I make sure that I keep a bib in one compartment so that everything I need is in one place.  I stand it up on one side of the bag, so I just reach in, grab it, and start feeding.  Do be warned that Gerber plastic containers do leak once they have been opened, so don't stand this pac on-end if you put an unfinished tub in it.  You may also try carrying a zippered sandwich bag in the compartment with the bib so that any possibility of leak-through is avoided.  Another added bonus is that it will hold two 2nd foods Gerber plastic containers in one of the center compartments, which is nice for long trips.  I also keep baby's meds (orajel, tylenol, motrin, mylicon, etc.) in one compartment when we're on long trips so that I know exactly where they are and so that they are well-insulated. TL;DR Love this Pac!"
"My yorkie-poo has been getting these bones for about a year now.  They are literally the ONLY thing we've found that completely neutralized his breath when it gets stinky.  I don't like to give him these more than a couple of times a week, even though he could have one a day - partly because they are not cheap, but also because he does seem to get an upset stomach if he has these daily.  My dog absolutely loves these bones and we have to double bag them so he can't catch any scent of them or he pesters us!  Every flavor we've tried has been a hit.  We call them our ""stinky breath bones"" and have found them to be well worth the expense. TL;DR Only thing I've found to work for my dog"
"The French cheese assortment is amazing. A selection of cheeses of a quality you cannot easily come by unless you have a great specialty gourmet store nearby. The Saint Andre is not my favorite type of cheese, but it is good on a nice loaf of crusty bread. The other cheeses in the selection are outstanding and I have received rave reviews from everyone I have served them to. Only negative is that they came extremely hot (even though they were in a cooler-type box with an ice pack that I assume had at one time been cold) and the softer cheeses were really melted. They still tasted great, but weren't as nice for presentation. TL;DR Excellent cheeses, ok service"
"the coffee was well packaged, and arrived quickly.<br />however, the flavor was ""off"".<br />i ordered southern pecan.<br />the taste was distinctly hazelnut.<br />not a good thing.<br />we're using it, regardless.  cutting the flavor with 2 parts breakfast blend to 1 part 'souther pecan'.<br />quality was fine.  somewhere along the line, however, i  think these bags were mislabeled. TL;DR mislabeled?"
"My son, who eats almost anything, would only eat 2 - 3 bites of this before refusing anymore.  Don't order unless (1) you know your baby loves sweet potatoes and apricots and (2) he/she is a great eater already. TL;DR Sounded great but my son would not eat it!"
"Cook's Delight natural shrimp base is simply delightful. The taste is natural and robust. I use it to make my special seafood spicy gravy dish over noodles and it taste great! Much better than the knorr shrimp boullion, which they no longer make. Thank goodness for Cook's Delight natural shrimp base! I'll definitely buy it again. TL;DR Excellent Soup Base Anytime"
"Not a western tasting entree by any stretch but a very good Indian vegetarian curry. Kinda hot but very tasty, especially the big chunks of mushrooms.  The pouch does not contain what I would call a full meal (but says 3 servings= no womder Indians are so slim)but served over a bowl of fresh rice with a salad does the trick.  The next time I make it, I'm going to add some tofu and see how that works.  I'll bet it turns out great.  Itsmells so good that the house carries the aroma for a long time.<br />I cut open the pouches and nuke it in a covered larger bowl to leave room for rice.  I.d buy this again. TL;DR Ready to heat Indian food"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Z7VYXW"">Saf Instant Yeast, 1-Pound Pouches (Pack of 4)</a>I bought this yeast because you get it cheaper than at about any store it does what yeast is meant to do well worth the money TL;DR SAF Instant yeast"
"My wife first brought home a... umm... bottle?  Container?  Squirt dropper thingy?.. of MIO a few months ago; a strawberry-watermelon flavor, if memory serves me, and I enjoyed it tremendously.  Always looking for something to drink that's not just water but rarely having a container of something in the fridge -- at least not for very long -- I was personally growing tired of powdery drink mixes and the mess they would make.  The measuring dirtied spoons and measuring cups, and frequently there was powder still at the bottom of the glass when I'd finished, making the last gulp seem as though I'd just swallowed syrup.<br /><br />These MIO packages change all that.  When you gently squeeze the container, a concentrated squirt of drink mix neatly goes into your glass, and after a sip or two, you'll know exactly how many squirts will make the perfect strength drink for you.  I find that I don't even need to stir any more than a brisk oscellation of my glass.  The squirt nozzle is very accurate, and nothing gets dirty.<br /><br />I'm more of a fan of the Lipton lemon iced tea flavor than the ""sweet tea"" flavor that's now so popular at fast food chains (my wife loves sweet tea like that, and like this MIO flavor), but I find that in the right squirt count, the flavor of this product is extremely similar to those products.<br /><br />And like the commercial on TV, this packaging is very portable, and I've had no issues with drippage from the bottle.  Lastly, and I think this is truee with all flavors, MIO liquids are caffeine-free, carbohydrate and suger-free, and calorie-free based on an 8-ounce glass.<br /><br />I would recommend that you try a MIO, but BEFORE YOU BUY ONE at the store or on Amazon, you might want to do a Google-search or check out the MIO Facebook page because I understand you can order a FREE SAMPLE from them to try it out first.  My apologies for the caps... just wanted to make sure you saw that before you place anything in your shopping cart.  :^) TL;DR It's even better than I expected"
I have tried all of the coconut waters available to the consumer and this one is the sweetest. I think it is because the coconut water is imported from Thailand or the coconuts are younger. I would have given it another star if shipping was not so expensive. Amazon should pick it up and sell it rather than a third party. TL;DR Sweeter coconut water from Thailan Than others from Brazil
"I purchased these herbes de Provence for a gift bag.  Cooking with these herbes is heavenly, and the beautiful Provençal fabric is a cool little reminder of the South of France. TL;DR Delicious!"
I just received my shipment and the packets are individual tossed into a plastic bag.  Some of the bags are broken so there are powder everywhere.  I'm going to attach a picture to this item if they would let me.  I was looking forward to trying it but I will need to return it.  It is unacceptable to have open food packages.  I'll update my review once it got resolved and I am able to taste it.<br /><br />Update: Amazon customer service is great.  They have a replacement on its way.  They said to throw out the broken package.  So I opened it to see what go damaged.  It might have been a manufacturing issue.  It looks like some of the seam busted open due to lack of glue or the pressure inside the package is so great that it burst.<br /><br />Update: I received the replacement hot chocolate and these showed up in perfect condition.  The chocolate is tasty but a little too sweet for me.  The added crushed peppermint might make it sweeter than normal.  Great for when you have a cold.  It is so soothing and no need to heat up milk.  Just add water.  Thank you Amazon. TL;DR Good but a little too sweet
"I like bacon on burgers and BLT's and was hopeful that this would give the bacon taste without the health concerns of bacon.  Big disappointment.  Smells like the Bac'n Bite dog treats I give my dog, probably tastes similar also.  Imagine a cheap store brand Mayo with liquid smoke and salt added you'll get the idea.  Full of artificial ingredients and chemical additives. Too salty and fake tasting.  I'll just stick with a good Mayo and skip the bacon. TL;DR Thought it would be better"
"These are great. The heat isnt overwhelming, its not pungent with chipotle flavor and overbearing...as someone whom isn't really into chipotle, this is awesome. It has a cheesey aroma-taste to it. great texture, and a big plus that its raw (not baked, likely dehydrated under the raw food temp guidelines), vegan, and seemingly 99.9% organic! Pricey, but if you must, indulge. High in sodium! ~460mg per serving. TL;DR Great!"
I have used echinacea for several years and just happened to check the price at Amazon and it was the best price for this high quality Frontier brand of echinacea. TL;DR Best price on the web
"I've tried a number of decaf teas (6 at last count, I think) and this is my favorite.  It's got body and depth of flavor with subtle hints of souchong, yet soft without the acidic taste some teas have.  Highly recommended. TL;DR The Best"
No longer to you have to buy bags of Jolly ranchers to get the best flavor! Watermelon! The 160 Count is priced at the cost if not less then what it cost's in the supermarket. TL;DR Delicious!
My dog loves these and this is a great deal!  They are so expensive at my local pet store. TL;DR Great deal
"This will be a short comment.  These are delicious.  Enough said, except that they only let you order one at a time. TL;DR Maruchan Instant Lunch Cheddar Cheese Flavor Delicious"
Yummy Gum - Best flavor they have. Really worth a try.  Flavor lasts long and tastes great. Has a good flavor burst and tastes like tropical fruit. TL;DR Yummy Gum - Best flavor they have.
"These are very addictive. I can't believe that I can't tell they are wheat-free! They are super delicious and do not taste fake or odd in any way. The chocolate chips are divine. I have eaten entirely too many this week after discovering them because I was waiting for them to have a strange after taste or make my tummy funny, but no, these cookies are just perfect. The calories aren't too bad either. It's something like 36 calories per cookie. This cookie gives much joy because eating gluten free is a bit of a hassle and this makes me feel like I am not missing out on anything! Thank you very much Kinnikinnick!! TL;DR completely satisfying!"
I don't much like to drink water but this product enables me to drink the amount of water I should be drinking every day. TL;DR Great stuff
"I received a banana bread bar for review with influenster.com's summer beauty voxbox program. This bar tastes so delicious! I went out the next day and bought a box. not to mention, it's good for you! TL;DR Delicious"
I shopped by price and this was far and away the best price out there. TL;DR Best Price
"As for the merchant: Fast and  efficient, and accurate.  No hassle.  Which is all you can ask for.<br />As for the brand: I don't think any K-cups compare with French press or other traditional methods that produce such a nice, round, complete flavor.  But, for K-cups and speed, this brand is the best I've tried, and I've sampled many different ORGANIC brands and coffeemakers. TL;DR the best yet"
"I bought these Tootsie Pops for my candy bowl at work.  I am the defacto *candy lady* at the hospital where I work.  I try to keep an assortment of different candies available - all individually wrapped, of course.  These suckers have really gone over well, and they love all of the different flavors - my personal favorite is Wild Black Berry. I also keep the original flavors, so I can have a big variety of suckers.  I do wish the price was a little lower - not everyone contributes to the *candy fund* piggy bank (which is really optional, as I enjoy providing the candy), but it would be nice if Tootsie Roll wouldn't charge quite so much for these suckers. TL;DR Love these new flavors!!!"
"This is an interesting twist on the usual white rice vermicelli.  I've eaten one serving of these and I can tell you that they are truly gluten-free.  However, they have an almost grainy texture that does not lend itself to soups.  These would probably work better in stir fry. TL;DR Truly Gluten-Free. Odd Texture."
"For a sugarfree gum, this stuff is really tasty. It has an intense flavor at first that softens into a more subtle orange cream taste. It lasts pretty long, but I've had gum that's lasted longer. It'll definitely make your breath smell good though.<br /><br />This is my favorite, and probably the most accurate, of all the extra dessert flavors. The mint chocolate chip doesn't taste much like mint or chocolate to me although it is refreshing, and the strawberry shortcake is so sweet it hurts my mouth. But they definitely got this one right on the money. TL;DR Tastes like a Creamsicle"
"I have been drinking Earl Grey for over 30 years and sadly watched the demise of my favored vendors one by one.  After the last disappearance, I tried the Taylors on the basis of the reviews.  Disappointment is not the right word. It smelled strange out of the box, and after brewing it properly discovered that it bore no resemblance to the dozens of different Earl Grey experiences I have had.  It is heavily dominated by the peaty nature of the Chinese black tea base (almost an Oolong) and the bergamot is barely detectable.  Unique, but not what I want.  De gustibus non disputandem. TL;DR What is this stuff?"
"I love this coffee, and I would definitely buy it again. After reading a few other reviews, I think that's because I like my coffee flavorful (and not bitter), but not overly bold. This coffee has a full but subtle flavor that carries just a hint of dark beans (or French roast), but it's just a hint, not overwhelming. Very smooth: It would be easy to drink cup after cup. My only criticism is that the packaging was not as easy to open as some other coffees I drink; next time, I'll start with a pair of scissors.<br /><br />But I do plan to purchase more of this coffee; I recommend it to others with coffee taste similar to mine. TL;DR Be bold, be bold, but not too bold"
The flavor is very rich and earthy. Blends evenly in baked goods and great in coffe and other hot drinks. This price for shipping was horribly outrageous though. TL;DR very nice
"i was on the way to a dinner engagement this evening and grabbed a can of the issimo cappuccino coffee on the way to car... it was a warm late afternoon, in the mid-80s, and i need a little something cool, sweet, and with a kick...<br /><br />this drink satisfied... i wasn't quite sure what to expect, but was pleasantly surprised when my palate was rewarded with soothing, smooth goodness...<br /><br />i tasted the creaminess first, then the chocolate, then the coffee... interesting flavor... not thin, not cloyingly sweet like that-other-brand-that-will-not-be-mentioned<br /><br />the can's form-factor is the only downside here - it bounced back-and-forth in my ride's built-in cup holder and it is too thin and tall for a normal coozy...<br /><br />perfect portion and perfect potion - i enjoyed this drink<br /><br />p.s. why does it say 'Do Not Shake'? that's one's first inclination! TL;DR smooth, chocolate, nice chilled"
This is great! The price is better than any stores around here and my dogs love it! Now they don't mind taking their pills TL;DR Great Treat
"I like sardines but don't eat them very often...maybe a 15 oz can every year, reason why I gave La Sirena 4 stars instead of 5 because there may be better sardines. Having said that, I am planning of storing food for at least 6 months and sardines seem to be an excellent choice just in case the world goes down the drain (or worst yet, a zombie apocalypse...just kidding).<br /><br />I agree with the other comment about the sardines being firm, I don't think they require extra cooking though, I like them the way they come...that's my taste. But then again, I don't know anything about sardines.<br /><br />La Sirena sardines (15 oz can) provides you with 7 servings:<br />protein: 12g, carbs: 2g, fat: 3g (approx.), and 250mg of sodium.  So the total is:<br />Protein 84g, carbs 14g, fat 21g, and sodium 1750mg. You'll find that the sodium and carbs are in the tomato sauce, so you just can eat the sardines if you cant have the sodium.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care about the high sodium content. In fact, if the world goes down the pipe I'll need anything I can get my hands on. For instance, I can mix the tomato sauce with olive oil and garlic to mix it with pasta. I know, I know, this is not gourmet eating, but when surving is the top priority you will eat what you must.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Absolutely!!!<br /><br />BTW it's supposed to be hot...it is not TL;DR La Sirena Sardine 15.0 Oz (tomato sauce)"
"This is a bulk case of the same creamer you'd purchase at the store.  Excellent, fresh tasting creamer delivered to your door and at a fraction of what other office supply companies charge.<br /><br />If you have popped containers, blame your mail carrier, not Amazon. TL;DR Quality Creamer"
"Very tasty, and really fills the spot when you are hungry but ""shouldn't"" have anything to eat because of blood sugars!  And you can actually taste the mushrooms! More, please! TL;DR GREAT soup and ""free"" for diabetics!"
"I purchased this as I wanted to give my baby an organic alternative to cereal found in supermarkets. I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.<br />BIG MISTAKE.<br />This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother-in-law said ""Boy, if I eat whole grain cereal in the evening, i act like a trumpet all night"" did I think. ""Waou, maybe it's the cereal"".<br />I've stopped giving her this and no more crying, arching and farting! TL;DR Gas gas gas"
I am amazed..I just bought a case to use as a preschool snack and I took one out to try and my three year old sucked one down in less then 30 seconds. I was shocked!  I am goito try the other flavors.  It has never been this easy to get a veggie in my little picky eater!! TL;DR Amazing
"The dog absolutely loves these! She gets anti-anxiety meds every morning and she will come running with tail wagging when she hears me open the pill bottle. Can you believe that? I don't even need to use the whole treat. I rip off about a third and they are soft so I mold it around the capsule. I then make her work for it by giving a few commands ""sit, stay, come, etc"" and she does them excitedly. After she gets her treat, she is so excited that she does a lap around the apartment. Overall, these pill pockets are a winner and I will use them as long as she keeps getting pills! TL;DR A keeper"
"I received this jar of French mustard in a broken state. Within minutes of leaving feedback and sending an e-mail I was sent a response, an apology, and a new jar. I am very impressed with the Frenchy Bee's customer service skills and will order from them again. TL;DR The Frenchy Bee has excellent customer service"
"We got the twenty-four-piece multi-pack, which comes with four flavors: Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, Strawberry, and Sour Apple.<br /><br />The ingredients for the Mixed Berry, Tropical Twist, and Strawberry are:<br />""organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavor, pectin, colored with fruit and vegetable juice.""  Also, some vitamins and minerals are added.<br /><br />Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added.<br /><br />The ""organic flavor"" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color.  We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are.<br /><br />These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should.  Our family didn't like them very much.  They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals).<br /><br />Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly.  The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them.<br /><br />The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones.  The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky.  (Braces wearers, beware.)<br /><br />For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead.  These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky. TL;DR Meh"
"I tried this chocolate after I saw it on the Martha Stewart Show. I usually expect ""Milk chocolates"" to be sweeter, which is not the case with this chocolate. People who would like to get a taste of the best milk chocolate on earth should try ""Milka"". I can highly recommend it. TL;DR disgusting"
The taste is wonderful. Its not for those who like very bold coffee tho. If you enjoy blue blueberry. Pick up a pack and enjoy. TL;DR very good
If I had been given this coffee in a cup I wouldn't have guessed it was decaf.  It is strong & good!  I have the regular version too and they taste about the same. TL;DR Best Decaf Coffee Pods
"I have been using this seasoning since I was a kid,  my son also loves it.  Enough said... TL;DR Morton's Nature's Seasons Seasoning Blend"
I never write reviews but in this case I had to make an exception.  To put it simply this stuff was HORRIBLE.  It was like drinking pink paint but not as good. After 1 cup I lined my garbage barrel with the rest.  If my barrel had taste buds it would have puked it back on me.  Stay away! TL;DR ugh
"These are so delicious!  Such an easy snack to throw in my bag to bring to work or on other travels.  They taste good and are a good way to get some healthy fruit!  My fave. flavor is the raspberry, but that just depends on personal preference as all the ones that I have tried are good! TL;DR Great!"
"I have a baby pomeranian and he is the biggest cry baby when he has to be put in his crate! I don't tolerate it so I'm training him to be in his crate for longer periods of time and these help. It takes awhile for him to be quiet when I open the container, but I give him one when I leave for a couple of hours and when I come back he is happy as a clam and much more quiet! I think it takes him about a half hour to eat one, but I think he's getting faster. I saw someone wondering if they should get the large to last longer and I'm thinking the same thing. They are really stinky, so I recommend putting them in an air tight container that's easy to get in and out of. My only complaint is that they are a bit expensive! I wish they came in one of those Amazon Bulk deals. TL;DR Great for leaving the house!"
"I have three cats, all healthy eaters, and I've always had 3 boxes. Since I really hate cleaning the boxes, I decided to try the sifting litter boxes, but bought only two of them.  I've found that they're so easy to clean, two is enough!  I only wish I had purchased them sooner. TL;DR I love these litter boxes!"
"I have used the individual bags of Pamela's Amazing GF Bread mix for some time, but I recently purchased the 3-pack of 4-pound bags.  I am very happy to report that the resulting bread is just as consistently wonderful as always.  Many of my non-GF friends have tasted this loaf, and they are amazed at how good it is! I use the stand-mixer-and-oven-baking method (rather than a bread machine), as I often make round loaves or rolls from the mix.  The bread is delicious, the preparation is easy, and now the cost is much more economical for me.  Just so you know (and you can do the math for yourself to see which is the better purchase for your family), there is (almost) enough flour in each bulk bag for 4 loaves, as prepared according to the directions on the back of the bag. Remember that with this product, yeast will be needed to add to the mix, along with eggs, oil, and water.  Using milk (rice, cow, soy) for all or part of the water will result in an even more tender and moist loaf.<br /><br />I have two loaves in the oven right now.  They smell fantastic! TL;DR Great GF Bread!"
"These are really awesome - the flavor is unexpected, but perfect; gives a boost to ""plain old"" pork rinds - lots more crunch with way less the calories of salt/vinegar chips!!!  In addition, the company is quite pleasant to deal with, and all the other products I've tried are delicious and a good bargain, too. TL;DR Great snacking!"
"At the current price, these are a great deal (4 boxes for about 11 dollars), so hopefully that won't change. Cheeze-It crackers are one of those snacks that I think you can have at (almost) any age. They have a perfect amount of cheddar taste, not going overboard but still giving it a perfect amount of flavor. The bite-sized crackers are very easy to take with you and a perfect snack on the go or to curb hunger until the next meal. Have them with your lunch, watching the ball game, after dinner, before lunch, whenever. At many stores, CheezeIts have skyrocketed in price ($4 a box), so this is a great deal if you are a ""Cheeze It"" fan.<br /><br />Great buy! TL;DR The one time it's okay to be cheezy..."
"This is some great stuff to mix with soup, rice, or any meat stuff.<br /><br />or keep it on the side to dip. It's pretty salty so be careful though.<br /><br />Great heat and garlicy depth. It's too bad no american company makes anything quite like this that I know of. TL;DR Hot Hun Happiness"
"I purchased this coffee for my husband, he likes a bold cup of coffee.<br />Excellant choice great taste. TL;DR Excellant Flavor"
This stuff is sooooo good.  I really the Starbucks green tea frapp but just can't justify the cost.  This tastes exactly the same at a fraction of the cost.  I add raspberry syrup (not pancake style) and really have a treat. TL;DR EXCELLENT
"i ordered this product before and i have waited so far 3 weeks for them and it has not showed up.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001VS9QK"">Drake's Cakes Devil Dogs</a> TL;DR Disppointed"
"Wow.<br /><br />These are wonderful.  Not just wonderful in the special diet kind of way (because you've forgotten what the ""real"" version tasted like).  These are truly delicious.  Including my macaroon consumption pre-special diet, Hail Merry's blondies are absolutely the best.<br /><br />My diet is grain-free among other things.  Almond flour is often used as a grain substitute in baking, but I usually do not like it.  I don't care for almonds, either.  If I hadn't seen almond flour on the label myself I never would have guessed it as an ingredient.  It blends perfectly with the coconut, vanilla, and maple.  The texture is just right and the size and shape of the macaroons are adorable to boot!<br /><br />I wish each pack had a few more macaroons, but then again . . . I might be at a greater risk for eating more.  I find these to be rich and satisfying.  A serving is two cookies but one is enough, at least for me.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to trying more of Hail Merry's products! TL;DR There are hardly words to describe the deliciousness"
"This is good stuff! When I went vegan the thing I missed most was cheese. I've gotten over it, but this ""chreese"" really brings back a flavor memory. Good texture, very smooth and creamy, and no nasty dairy. Excellent replacement for Mac-n-cheese. I doubt that your family would even know the difference. I'm sure it's more healthy too, not that it matters to me. TL;DR Yum!"
"I never thought this day would come. I left you, Cheerios, years ago when I thought there could be something better for me, something sweeter. People made fun of us, calling our love ""puppy love"". They even called you baby food.<br /><br />I was confused, and we took some time off. You went your way, and I went to oatmeal, then the flashy Kashi, and then many other cereals. They were ok relationships, but nothing like the relationship I had with you. Kashi was too sweet, too full of frills and she left me craving for more. Kashi was also a gold digger, and demanded so much of my money. Oatmeal got too messy and time consuming in the mornings... I was forlorn.<br /><br />Years later, while studying for an exam, my friend introduced me to you again. I couldn't have been happier.<br /><br />After years of searching for the perfect cereal, I knew it was you, it could only be you. We belong together, you are so delicious without being cloyingly sweet like other cereals, you're good FOR me and, you don't take much of my time and money.<br /><br />Will you take me back, Cheerios? TL;DR mmm mmm cheerios :)"
"Baby love it!Taste sweet but there is no sugar and smell good too, baby love itMy baby it's 7 months old he refuse to open his mouth ,but since I try this cereal he seem like ask me for more every time I feed him. I was looking for Milupa and Plasmon brands,I grow up in Italy and the baby food it's different from USA, so I found this Nestle Cereal for baby made in Europe ,I order and I try,taste wonderfull ,better that gerber. TL;DR Exellent!!  Buonissimo!!"
"I used 3 drops on my long, thick, color treated, hot styling tool used hair and it made my hair look like I poured oil all over it. Its so gross and the fact I used almost nothing in the amount of hair makes me think that it is not a good product. It also made my hair feel dry and stiff after I put it on my damp hair and took a while for me to be able to comb out before drying.  It smells wonderful however but I wont use it again. TL;DR YUCK"
"The look of the ham was somewhat dissapointing.  Having eaten Jamon Serrano throughout latin America and Spain... I was not blown away like I was hoping,,, it was OK but only OK. TL;DR not the best jamon serrano"
"Other than getting a TON of the bags at once, these are great! I add them to some other cereals to add some more flavor and nurients. Good stuff. TL;DR Healthy."
"My favorite pretzels in the world are Ener-g sesame pretzel rings-light and crispy and with seeds on the pretzels. Thought I was buying those,only in a bigger package.These are hard and dry-not crispy-dry!and must be made with ground sesame seeds because I can't find a seed on any of them.Next time will read description and check picture better. TL;DR not what I expected"
"Frosted Flakes has been my favorite cereal since I was a toddler! I remember my mom taking a small box with her when we went to visit Aunts and Uncles because she was never sure if they'd have a box in the house. (OK, so once my Aunt had some in the house and she took offense; I guess my cousins liked Frosted Flakes, too!)<br /><br />They have that sugar on them that I absolutely crave; true, with all the dietary advice out there these days Frosted Flakes may be something of a guilty pleasure for me--but, then again, who cares! I pour myself a bowl, add some milk and I am ready to go to town!<br /><br />Others have noted that they come with an expiration date that is far enough in advance so you won't have to worry about eating them too fast; and they are right.<br /><br />Overall, Frosted Flakes has always been and probably always will be my favorite cereal. I don't know that I've ever actually met a person who can (honestly) say that they don't like Frosted Flakes. I highly recommend that you get some today and enjoy! TL;DR a guilty pleasure ~~ BUT I LOVE 'EM !!!"
The Mints arrived with a chill pack to insure they would not melt in the summer heat! The jar is handy for serving and the mints are fresh and tasty. Recommend this product for entertaining and as a gift to send or bring. TL;DR Delicious and Chilled
"Wow, great sauce, bangers and mash, breakfast etc. A Brit essential, a really great price, effortless shipping, plastic bottles... It doesn't get any better folks. No more trips to cheezy ""brit"" stores, no more puddles in the luggage. Love you Amazon XXX TL;DR Yes please !!!"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UUWECC"">O.N.E. Coconut Water, 11.2-Ounce Aseptic Containers (Pack of 12)</a><br />I'm from Brazil and I used to live right on the coast of Pernambuco. Coconut water is something I grew up drinking and I missed it once I moved to the USA. Now that I've found O.N.E. I'll always have this sweet taste of Brazil with me.<br />Besides being a great source of potassium and electrolites O.N.E. is 100% natural and taste great.<br />Two thumbs up! TL;DR amazing"
"These snack sticks are all individually wrapped and are very good! They taste a lot better than slim jims, plus my dog likes to lick the wrapper if i accidentally leave one on the floor overnight! TL;DR very tasty"
"I've tried a number of ginger beers/ales after stumbling upon some locally, and of those Fever-Tree is simply the best.<br /><br />I'm not picky about carbonation so I can't comment on that, but it has a strong ginger bite and isn't overly sweet. The real selling point is that the flavor comes from the ginger and not fruit juice or added spice, exactly what I want. I say this in relation to Reed's ginger beer which I place just behind this in ranking; it has a similar bite, and is also 'natural', but is rather sweet and the pineapple and lime juices don't contribute to the experience. I say spice in relation to Blenheim's spicy ginger ale which is just that. I could be wrong, but regardless it's beyond the point where it's palatable. I've also tried the Ginger People variety which lacks the bite and sweetness, leaving an earthy ginger taste. I don't enjoy it alone but it is present in the Fever-Tree brew, and this is good. I suppose I should note that I haven't tried these as mixers<br /><br />The downside (at least for us US folks) is obviously the expense. I can't quote prices but even with Prime Fever-Tree is more than 3 times the cost-per-ounce of Reed's which is available to me locally. And the question, is it worth it? For me, mostly. I don't drink much soda, but I'm accustomed enough that I can overlook Reed's's sweetness for its price. At the same time I will keep stocking these with the intention of making them last. I certainly don't regret buying a case just to try it. They're. Just. So. Good. TL;DR The best I've found"
"I tried this last month in NYC where they were offering samples of it around Grand Central - really great tasting, which surprised me at first. It does taste great.  I go through 3-4 Iced Coffees a day which ends up running over $10 bucks easy. I'm so glad that you (Amazon) are now carrying this as I haven't been able to get it yet at the local ShopRite or Stop and Shop. Thanks - my iced coffee fix at work is now under control. TL;DR Glad Amazon has this"
"My family members have used words like ""gross"" and ""disgusting"" to describe these chews and I have to admit that I agree.  We routinely eat natural foods and snacks so I wasn't expecting Twizzlers - but I was expecting a product that tasted like raspberry.  Something about the molasses + fruit gives it a weird twang and a wretched aftertaste that was very much like prune juice.  If you love really dark molasses (like blackstrap) then perhaps you might like these but I am having trouble even giving them away. TL;DR Foul"
"Again, I was dissapointed.  While this tea was alright in flavor, and I love the concept behind the company and it's dedication to fair trade (not that this is one of the fair trade teas) but I've been underwhelmed.  I have to say Numi's Sunset Oolong has a better flavor. TL;DR Eh..."
"I just ordered this after seeing it in my specialty pet food store.  It's a tad expensive but I can understand why.  I can totally read and understand all the ingredients!  And my picky dogs both LOVE it.  I also like that they tell you the calories per treat (8.8 if you're wondering) so I can better keep track of my dogs daily caloric intake.<br /><br />The fact that it comes in small pouches also is great so you don't open an big pouch and let it go stale.<br /><br />Both my dogs (including my 5lb Maltese) LOVE it!!<br /><br />My only criticism of this product would be how much the label recommends for small dogs.  I would never give my dog 16 treats per day!!!  That's almost half of one of my dog's entire day's needs and almost 2/3 of my smaller Maltese's needs!!!<br /><br />Oh, and a 2nd criticism: although it's called the ""pumpkin and blueberries"" treat, if you look at the ingredient list, blueberries are second to last on the list...which means very little blueberries.  Slightly misleading in my opinion.  It would be more correct to say ""pumpkin and oatmeal"" or ""pumpkin and molasses"" or anything else besides blueberries.<br /><br />But overall, I will be using these instead of baking my own. TL;DR Yum Yum and I can understand the ingredients!!!"
You wouldn't know this granola is gluten-free.  It's delicious mixed with yogurt and fruit.  It was delivered within the estimated delivery time and arrived in perfect condition. TL;DR Wouldn't know it's gluten-free
my cat loves this food and I love that it's organic and fresh plus the people are amazing and there to answer all your questions and concerns about your pets diet TL;DR my cat has been dancing
"I'm cancelling my subscription to these as the come all beat to hell.  Not from shipping, the cans in the middle of the 12 pack flat were the most damaged.  Drank them this time anyway though.  I also found a store that sells Blue Monkey for less than the subscription price. TL;DR All Dented Up- its true"
"These peanut butter balls are great, full of protein and very satisfying.  There is only one caveat.  Keep them off of the counter if you have a tall dog.  My basset got the box down while I was out and enjoyed about 12-14 of these balls.  He was very satisfied, however he had a severe case of diarrhea for 3 days.  He, however, was very happy.  LOL TL;DR Fabulous product"
"Let me start by saying that I love tea. I love Numi's teas the best as they are organic and also fair trade products. I have purchased many of Numi's other fine teas through both Amazon.Com & Numi in the past.<br /><br />However, the Dry Desert Lime tea is the first flavor of tea I couldn't stand the taste of at all! The Dry Desert Lime tea is tart, smells and tastes medicinal and looks like coffee when brewed. Let's just say the Dry Desert Lime flavor isn't my cup of tea! TL;DR Not to myy liking taste wise that is..."
"Ever since I saw Mio I thought it was a cute idea, but why do I really need flavor? I prefer function, and VitaminSqueeze Fruit Punch is my family's favorite, and get the flavor for free!<br />Great taste! My kids definitely prefer a small glass of ""Fruit Punch"" in the morning over a Gummy Vitamin. Anyway, great new product. I recommend. TL;DR Liquid Vitamin that tastes great!"
"I enjoy regular coffee for only about the first five minutes after it's brewed - then it no longer tastes good to me.  And if regular coffee is brewed strong, it tastes bitter.  But with Cool Brew, it's possible to make your coffee just as strong as you like because no matter how much you mix into your cup it will NEVER taste bitter!  Here in the south, I use Cool Brew to make really strong iced coffee every morning.  I mix it into either milk or soy milk and it is absolutely wonderful.  GREAT stuff! TL;DR Try it and you'll be hooked!"
I am very satisfied with this product. The are crispy and delicious. I will buy them again. TL;DR Just like special K berries!
it is so hard to find decaf tea for the kerig maker. the flavor is great the price is great and I will buy it again for sure TL;DR decaf tea
I puchased this today at costco for 38.28 total. I took one bottle before i went to the gym cus i was exhausted from a hot long day at work. I was skeptical about this cus ived tried many imitations or 5hr energy. But nothing has worked till i tried this. It kicked in with minutes and it had the effects just like 5hr energy. I heard this is made by 5hr energy and just repackaged for costco as their kirkland brand name. Worth the $$$ and will by these instead of 5hr energy brand from now on!<br /><br />Its almost the exact same as the 5hr energy extra strength. Only difference is the niacin which is 30mg instead of 40mg. But has 2150mg of energy blend compared to 2000mg. It also has less soduim at 15mg compared to 18mg.<br /><br />Dont hesitate and buy this product!!!<br /><br />Cheers- DP TL;DR Excellent product!
"Living in the US of Norwegian heritage I used to ask visiting Norwegians to bring me one thing from home: some cans of cod-liver.. But then I discovered Amazon sells this very good product and visiting Norwegians are now freed of that task...<br /><br />I eat this as a spread on bread for breakfast or snack, with some chopped onion and pepper on top, for dinner with boiled potatoes, or as supplement to fresh steamed cod (pref with cod-roe also). It is equally excellent in all dishes.<br /><br />Yummy! TL;DR Good!"
"My dog adores these treats.  All natural ingredients and they smell like the flavors they are supposed to be.  Barney loves all the flavors, but the peanut butter & molasses ones make him dance! Best thing is that they're low fat so I don't feel guilty giving them to him. TL;DR As good as home baked!"
"The bar is a dark green color so I was a little hesitant at first...but I was really surprised!  They are excellent.  And so incredibly good for you!  I had my very first one today, and I think I'm going to try the powders out, too. TL;DR Really Yummy!"
I just tried the Spicy Amy's Chili. It was the best ever. I will try the other products as well. Keep up the good work. Your food is amazing. TL;DR Yum Yum
"After trying and not liking the Spirulina flavor, I compared the nutritional data of all RR bars and specifically chose the Raspberry flavor for its lowest fat content. I still find it too greasy to enjoy it. TL;DR greasy"
Organic licorice in a totally unique flavor..<br />  * sweet w/o being overly sweet.<br />  * Low in both fat and suger<br />  * Low Cal only 130 per serving<br />  * Chewy and light with a nice welcoming fruity flavor.<br /><br />Who wouldnt want this yummy chewy snack thats fun to have around and a prefectly lovely without being overly indulgent treat. TL;DR Yummy
"we purchased this bowl for our Vizsla puppy.  I wasn't sure if it would work at this time because he was only 8wks old (at the time of purchase).  We have been using it for 2wks now and are very please with how it keeps him from wolfing down his food.  I would highly recommend this bowl to any owner of a ""chow hound.""  It is great for any dog who has a potential for developing bloat. TL;DR Works great!!"
"No coffee gets 5 stars from me unless it was just roasted and ground within the last half hour. Additionally, I have no problems with acid reflux. Given that, I do like a light roast; not a fan of french roast or anything Starbucks.<br />Given that, this is the first french roast I have ever liked. I found it mild smooth and drinkable. I was surprised, especially given my low expectations. If the acid in some coffee bothers you, I think this is worth a try. TL;DR Smooth"
"My son is allergic to milk and wheat on on the ASD spectrum so he's been on the Gluten-free Casein-free diet all his life. He loves these brownies. I make them with egg white and water instead of the oil to cut out the added fat, but they are still great and easy to make. The only drawback is that they are full of sugar, which makes my son hyper-stim so we have to dole them out one at a time.<br /><br />We buy them buy the case from Amazon every few months. Thanks Gluten Free Pantry. TL;DR Absolutely delicious brownies"
"Kellogg's does not disclose that the ingredients in their cereals contain GMO's. That means the corn and sugar have had their DNA spliced with another species, usually a toxin or a bacteria. Kellogg's has contributed over 600,000 dollars to prevent laws that would require labeling of GMO's. But most Americans agree that they have a right to know what is in the food they are buying and feeding to their children. TL;DR What is in that cereal?"
Exactly as described at the best price !  I searched the entire Internet and by far this was the best deal on Amazon! TL;DR Sweet Leaf Vanilla Creme Liquid Stevia
"I should've done more research before buying this product. My dog seemed to have very little appetite when she was on this food. She had skin problems. She had loose stools. Unfortunately I didn't want to believe that it had anything to do with the food. I finally decided to look into it after months of trying to get her to eat it more regularly and found that my problems weren't uncommon with this food. I've since switched her to Blue Buffalo food and her skin problems have gotten better, she has become more energetic, her stools are no longer loose and she happily eats. TL;DR I should've done more research before buying this"
"Every time I repot plants, or buy new ones, I get little gnat things flying all over. This product will get rid of them. There is not odor, and they are easy to use. You just put one in the dirt with provided stakes in each plant. When you no longer see gnats, you can just toss these in the garbage. Make sure to have some on hand for when you need them again. They keep the gnats from spreading if you put them out right away. Very reasonably priced. (If you are unable to watch the gnats dying, and it makes you sad, do not look at the strips.) I have given many of mine away, because as soon as someone asks me what it is, they want some! TL;DR Excellent Product"
"This photo was taken by my friend Mike Zofchak. It was taken at St Raphael Church in Koloa, Kauai, Hawaii on a cloudy day. There was no sun, and the photo is not changed in any way. It has the most beautiful spectrum of rainbow colors!!  Very inspiring.<br />Aloha! TL;DR Beyond description ~ a miracle"
"Who would know that dried cherries can vary so much in quality? These cherries are exquisite. They are sweet yet tart, soft yet firm, and have fantastic cherry taste. I bought the 4lb box. You can pour them into a large jar and keep them in your kitchen. Note that these are much better than another brand of dried cherries sold here. All the positive reviews are perfectly deserved. TL;DR Outstanding Cherries"
Acquired taste maybe?  Nobody in my family enjoyed it.  Found it pretty vile overall.  Didn't finish a cup.  Too harsh and too strong.  Just not something I enjoyed at all.  I am a huge fan of ginger and lemon too so I can't say I don't like the flavors. TL;DR Eh
"This is my new favorite ""k-cup"" (it's not a k-cup but it fits in all Keurig machines)! It's very strong, but not bitter or burnt--it's just plain great coffee.  I wish I had invented this cheaper version of a k-cup, because this design is genius.  Out of 15 of my cups of this coffee so far, only one had a coffee ground in it--just one little piece.<br /><br />This is best with just cream, it's just plain luxurious!  Thanks SF Bay Coffee! TL;DR Good strong coffee (new favorite), and a bit better for the environment!"
I thought this was the cutest thing. I call my friend Gummy Bear so it was the perfect Christmas gift. TL;DR Gummy Bear!
"I switched from another, much more expensive, brand and now prefer this one.  This Vitacost coconut oil is not as clumpy as the brand I was using; and therefore easier to work with and mix with my flax and cottage cheese each day.  The flavor is good and I like the statements on the container:  organic, cold pressed (to leave in all the good healthy stuff), lab tested for heavy metals, etc.  Overall, an excellent value. TL;DR Nice value product and price - great taste and workability cold"
"Moist, Flavorful, DELISH!! This cake deserves 10 stars! My husband finished it b4 me! It truly is delicious TL;DR super yummy!"
I have been using stevia quite often the past 5-6 months.  The English toffee is just one of the flavors we get.  Using this helps me to avoid drinking soda and also helps to have more fluid intake than I have in the past.  The English toffee has a mild sweet flavor that I like. TL;DR perky
"I ordered these chestnuts on 8/20/2012 and received them on 8/24/2012.  The listed date of production on most of these packages is 10/29/2011 with an expiration date of 12/28/2012.  However, multiple packages contained molded, black chestnuts.  The insides of the molded packages were also very wet and sticky.<br /><br />I've purchased Galil chestnuts from local stores in the past and the products SHOULD be dry when opened and the chestnuts should be a tan/brown color. TL;DR Molded chestnuts."
"THIS IS IN MY TOP 5 CHIPS I love these things... literally I can eat the whole bag in one sitting (Im not a fatass, lol) Although it is pretty hard to find these things in texas. It seems as if they only sell them in the fall. idk but these are awesome and if i ever need some I would probably order from here! TL;DR I did not purchase from this seller. Just my review on the product."
"This peanut butter is what one would expect for the brand: good peanut flavor and nice creamy texture. However, upon reading the ingredients list I noticed it had hydrogenated oils so I don't think in this day and age one should consume that. There are plenty of other peanut butter options out there just as good but without funny ingredients. TL;DR Good taste and texture but don't care for the hydrogenated oils"
"I am disappointed. They work as advertised: quick, clean, and easy. However, more important to me is taste.<br /><br />While individually wrapped, the freshness of beans ground just for that moment is missing. The pod itself uses less coffee than I would in a single shot. Since I more often will make lungos, the sheer lack of coffee volume produces a weaker drink. Instead of pulling twice as long, I pull it 80% as long for a short shot, but it takes longer to get it all into the cup.<br /><br />The crema is impressive, equal to any regular Illy.<br /><br />The cost-per-drink is poor. I already knew this, but hoped I would be impressed enough by the quality so as to tolerate the price.<br /><br />I regular buy cans of illy's dark roast whole beans for grinding into espresso. These ESEs are not as good as the real thing. Because of the high standard illy otherwise supports for its products, I cannot give my full support to the illy Caffe Scura Coffee, Espresso, (Dark Roast, Black Band), 18-Count E.S.E. Pods.<br /><br />--Brockeim TL;DR Not Up to illy's High Standard"
One of the best shampoos on the market due to the fact that it's properties are predominately natural composing of oatmeal and tea tree oil. Tea Tree Oil is known internationally for it's tremendous healing properties and skin conditioning capabilities. I highly recommend this product to anyone. TL;DR Tropliclean Natural Shampoo
This is just as effective as the stuff you buy at outrageous prices at Whole Foods Market in the bulk bins.  Buying it here makes it affordable to cook gluten free recipes! TL;DR Reasonable price for great product
Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce is pretty good.  I go to TAco Bell because they have fast and cheap vegetarian fast food.  I tried the Spicy Ranchero Sauce and it taste just like the stuff they use in the restaurant.  I enjoyed the sauce and I would definitely purchase it the next time I find it in the store.  If you're a fan of Taco Bell's flavor sauces then you'l enjoy this one. TL;DR I can make my own cheesy bean and rice burritos!
This large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog. It's also worth purchasing this larger sized bag (or get two of them at once) in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time. TL;DR Excellent dog food!
This wine Kit is very good.  It has a large amount of juice to start with so that you have a very tasteful wine.  Recommend it to anyone that loves Cab Sauv. TL;DR Nice Wine
"I was first introduced to astronaut ice cream about 2-3 years ago and it is amazing and really fun to eat. I have a 4 & 8 year old boys and a 15 year old nephew that love these. They definitely are quite different from a real scoop of ice cream out of the freezer, but it is only in texture and the experience. I have since ordered these to give out at Christmas time for my son's classmates. I thought this would be a totally unique, great, and affordable gift for all of them and am sure most of them have not had this before. I definitely think everyone should try this at least once and if you don't want to buy the 15 packages you can order them individually and there's different flavors too. (There are 25 kids in the class so I ordered 2 of the bulk and then I'll have some left over for my nephew, boys, myself & husband). TL;DR Awesome"
These chocolates at USD12 for 6 packs is a steal.<br /><br />It's not only cheaper than store prices but it's also more convenient. I don't even have to leave my house to get my hands on my favorite crunch chocolates. TL;DR Crunch Funsize is really Fun
The past two years this has been my go to Bold.  The 50 pk is a great value and the coffee reminds me of Rain forest Espresso or Santa's Buzz. TL;DR Best balanced Bold K-Cup with value to boot.
"We will not buy this mix.  We would rather go without.  The texture is terrible -- rubbery and full of bubbles -- and way too sweet. TL;DR Rubbery, sweet & floofy"
"I love the Chocolate Glazed Donut coffee.  It is the best flavored coffee there is.  I use it as my bedtime treat.  I plan to buy more of it. TL;DR Good, good coffee from Amazon."
"This granola was so tasty, I couldn't stop munching on it after I opened up a bag. I gave 3 of the 4 bags away to friends and all of them agreed it tasted delicious. I tried it in hot water (like oatmeal), milk (like cereal), and straight out of the bag (as a snack) - all three ways were still great! Highly recommended! TL;DR Delicious!"
"This stuff is glorified mustard, there are better products of this type on the market. G King, Troy, AL TL;DR Glorified Mustard"
"A couple of people commented that this candy is the same ORIGINAL product as the ones many of us remember from our childhood. It is NOT! I just received mine, and was expecting the same delightful taste from my childhood in the late 40's...I'm extremely disappointed! The colors are faded, and there is virtually no flavor at all! The packaging reads ""original"", which I find to be false advertising. This is NOT the original Necco wafers that I grew up with, or that I ate just a couple of years ago. Very sad indeed! TL;DR Disappointed!"
